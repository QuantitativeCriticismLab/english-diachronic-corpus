"Thilke ordenaunce moveth the hevene and the sterres CMBOETH-M3,452.C1.485

and atemprith the elementz togidre amonges hemself, CMBOETH-M3,452.C1.486

and transformeth hem by entrechaungeable mutacioun.  CMBOETH-M3,452.C1.487

And thilke same ordre neweth ayein alle thinges growynge and fallynge
adoun, by semblable progressions of sedes and of sexes <paren> that is
to seyn, male and femele <$$paren>.  CMBOETH-M3,452.C1.488

And this ilke ordre constreyneth the fortunes and the dedes of men by
a bond of causes nat able to ben unbownde; the whiche destynal causes,
whan thei passen out fro the bygynnynges of the unmoevable purveaunce,
it moot nedes be that thei ne be nat mutable.  CMBOETH-M3,452.C1.489

And thus ben the thinges ful wel igoverned yif that the symplicite
duellynge in the devyne thoght scheweth forth the ordre of causes unable
to ben ibowed.  CMBOETH-M3,452.C1.490

And this ordre constreyneth by his <P_452.C2> propre stablete the moevable
thingis, CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.491

or elles thei scholden fleten folyly. "For whiche it es that alle thingis
semen to ben confus and trouble to us men, CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.492

for we ne mowen nat considere thilke ordenaunce.  CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.493

Natheles the propre maner of every thing, dressynge hem to gode, disponith
hem alle, CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.494

for ther nys no thing doon for cause of yvel, CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.495

ne thilk thing that is doon by wikkid folk nys nat doon for yvel,
the whiche schrewes, as I have schewed ful plentyvously, seken good,
but wikkid errour mystorneth hem; CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.496

ne the ordre comynge fro the poynt of sovereyn good ne declyneth nat

"But thou mayst seyn,'What unreste may ben a worse confusioun than
{it_may_be} that gode men han somtyme adversite and somtyme prosperite,
and schrewes also han now thingis that they desiren and now thinges that

Whethir men lyven now in swich holnesse of thought <paren> as who seith

But in this manere the domes of men discorden, that thilke men that

CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.500

But lat us graunten, I pose, that som man may wel demen or knowen the
good folk and the badde; CMBOETH-M3,452.C2.501

may he thanne knowen and seen thilke innereste atempraunce of corages

As who seith, may a man speken and determinen of atempraunce in corages,

Ne it ne is nat an unlike miracle to hem that ne knowen it nat <paren>

that some syk folk ben holpen with lyghte medicynes, and some folk ben

But natheles the leche, that knoweth the manere and the atempraunce of

But what othir thing semeth hele of corages but <P_453.C1> bounte and

And what othir thing semeth maladye of corages but vices?

Who is elles kepere of good or dryvere awey of yvel but God, governour and

Lo, herof comyth and herof is don this noble miracle of the ordre

"But for to constreyne <paren> <font> as who seith, but for to comprehende

Thanne whatsoevere thou mayst seen that is doon in this world unhopid or

but as to thi wikkid opynioun it is a confusioun.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.519

But I suppose that som man be so wel ithewed that the devyne
jugement and the jugement of mankynde accorden hem togidre of hym;
CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.520

but he is so unstidfast of corage that, yif any adversite come to hym,
he wol forleten peraventure to continue innocence by the whiche he ne
may nat withholden fortune.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.521

Thanne the wise dispensacion of God sparith hym, the whiche man adversite

that travaile nis nat covenable.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.522

Anothir man is parfit in alle vertus, CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.523

and is an holi man and neigh to God, so that the purveaunce of God wolde
deme that it were a felonie that he were touched with any adversites; so
that he wol nat suffre that swich a man be moeved with any bodily maladye.
CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.524

But so as seyde a philosophre, the more excellent by me - he seyde in Grec
that'vertues han edified the body of the holi man. ' CMBOETH-M3,453.C1.525

"And ofte tyme it betydeth that the somme of thingis that ben to done
is taken to governe to good folk, for that the malice haboundaunt of
schrewes scholde ben abated.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.527

And God yeveth and departeth to other folk prosperites and adversites
imedled to-hepe aftir the qualite of hir corages, CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.528

and remordith some folk by adversite, CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.529

for thei ne scholden nat waxen proude by long welefulnesse;
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.530

and other folk he suffreth to ben travailed with harde thinges for
that thei scholden confermen the vertues of corage by the usage and the

And other folk dreden more than thei oughten the whiche thei myghte wel

and thilke folk God ledeth into experience of hemself by aspre and
sorweful thingis.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.533

And many other folk han bought honourable renoun of this world by the
prys of glorious deth; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.534

and som men, that ne mowen nat ben overcomen by torment, han yeven
ensample to other folk that vertu mai nat ben overcomyn by adversites.
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.535

And of alle thise thinges ther nis no doute that thei ne ben doon
ryghtfully and ordeynly, to the profit of hem to whom we seen thise
thingis betyde.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.536

"For certes, that adversite cometh somtyme to schrewes and somtyme
that that they desiren, it comith of thise forseyde causes.
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.537

And of sorweful thinges that betyden to schrewes, certes, no man ne
wondreth; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.538

for alle men wenen that thei han wel desservid it, and that thei ben of
wykkid meryt.  Of whiche schrewes the torment somtyme agasteth othere
to don felonyes, and somtyme it amendeth hem that suffren the tormentz ;
CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.539

and the prosperite that is yeven to schrewes scheweth a gret argument
to good folk what thing thei scholde demen of thilke welefulnesse, the
whiche prosperite men seen ofte serven to schrewes.  In the whiche thing
I trowe that God dispenseth.  CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.540

For peraventure the nature of som man is so overthrowynge to yvel,
and so uncovenable, that the nedy poverte of his houshold myghte rather
egren hym to don felonyes; CMBOETH-M3,453.C2.541

and to the maladye of hym God putteth remedye to yeven hym <P_454.C1>
rychesses.  CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.542

And som othir man byholdeth his conscience defouled with synnes,
CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.543

and therfore he wol chaunge his maneris, CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.546

and, for he dredith to lesen his fortune, he forletith his wikkidnesse.
CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.547

To other folke is welefulnesse iyeven unworthely, the whiche overthroweth
hem into destruccioun, that thei han disservid; CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.548

and to som othir folk is yeven power to punysshen, for that it schal
be cause of contynuacioun and exercisynge to good folk, and cause of
torment to schrewes.  CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.549

For so as ther nis noon alliaunce bytwixe good folk and schrewes, ne
schrewes ne mowen nat acorden among hemself.  CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.550

And whi nat?  CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.551

For schrewes discorden of hemself by hir vices, the whiche vices al
toreenden her consciences, and doon ofte time thinges the whiche thingis ,
whan thei han doon hem, they demen that tho thinges ne scholden nat han
ben doon. "For whiche thing thilke sovereyne purveaunce hath makid ofte
tyme fair myracle, so that schrewes han makid schrewes to ben gode men.
CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.552

For whan that some schrewes seen that they suffren wrongfully felonyes
of othere schrewes, they wexen eschaufed into hate of hem that anoyed
hem, CMBOETH-M3,454.C1.553

and retornen to the fruyt of vertu, whan thei studien to ben unlyke to

Certis oonly this is the devyne myght to the whiche myghte yvelis ben
