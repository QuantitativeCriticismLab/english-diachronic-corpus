<P_169>

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} not to be imagined the satisfaction of these two
young lovers; nor the vows she made him, that she <P_170> remained a
spotless maid till that night, and that what she did with his grandfather
had robb'd him of no part of her virgin-honour; the gods, in mercy and
justice, having reserved that for her plighted lord, to whom of right
it belonged.  BEHN-E3-P2,170.2

And $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} impossible to express the transports he suffer'd
, while he listen'd to a discourse so charming from her loved lips;
and clasped that body in his arms, for whom he had so long languished :
BEHN-E3-P2,170.3

and nothing now afflicted him, but his sudden departure from her;
BEHN-E3-P2,170.4

for he told her the necessity, and his commands, BEHN-E3-P2,170.5

but should depart satisfy'd in this, That since the old king had hitherto
not been able to deprive him of those enjoyments which only belonged to
him, he believed for the future he would be less able to injure him:
so that, abating the scandal of the veil, which was no otherwise so,
than that she was wife to another, he believed her safe, even in the
arms of the king, and innocent; BEHN-E3-P2,170.6

yet would he have ventur'd at the conquest of the world, and have given
it all to have had her {have} avoided that honour of receiving the
royal veil.  BEHN-E3-P2,170.7

$'T $was {TEXT:'Twas} thus, between a thousand caresses, that both
bemoan'd the hard fate of youth and beauty, so liable to that cruel
promotion: BEHN-E3-P2,170.8

$'t $was {TEXT:'twas} a glory that could well have been spared here,
tho desired and aim'd at by all the young females of that kingdom.
BEHN-E3-P2,170.9

But while they were thus fondly employ'd, forgetting how time ran on,
and that the dawn must conduct him far away from his only happiness, they
heard a great noise in the Otan, and unusual voices of men; at which the
prince, starting from the arms of the frighted <font> Imoinda <$$font>,
ran to a little battle-ax he used to wear by his side; BEHN-E3-P2,170.10

and having not so much leisure as to put on his habit, he opposed himself
against some who were already opening the door: which they did with so
much violence, that <font> Oroonoko <$$font> was not able to defend it ;
but was forced to cry out with a commanding voice, <font> Whoever ye are
that have the boldness to attempt to approach this apartment thus rudely;
know, that I, the Prince <$$font> Oroonoko, <font> will revenge it with
the certain death of him <$$font> <P_171> <font> that first enters:
BEHN-E3-P2,171.11

Therefore, stand back, BEHN-E3-P2,171.12

and know, this place is sacred to love and me this night;
BEHN-E3-P2,171.13

to-morrow $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} the king's.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,171.14

This he spoke with a voice so resolv'd and assur'd, that they soon
retired from the door; BEHN-E3-P2,171.15

but cry'd, <font>'$'T $is {TEXT:Tis} by the king's command {by} we are
come; BEHN-E3-P2,171.16

and being satisfy'd by thy voice, O prince, as much as
{we_would_have_been_satisfied} if we had enter'd, we can report to the
king the truth of all his fears, and leave thee to provide for thy own
safety, as thou art advis'd by thy friends.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,171.17

At these words they departed, BEHN-E3-P2,171.18

and left the prince to take a short and sad leave of his <font> Imoinda
<$$font>; who, trusting in the strength of her charms, believed she
should appease the fury of a jealous king, by saying, she was surprized
, and that it was by force of arms {by} he got into her apartment.
BEHN-E3-P2,171.19

All her concern now was for his life, BEHN-E3-P2,171.20

and therefore she hasten'd him to the camp, BEHN-E3-P2,171.21

and with much ado prevail'd on him to go.  BEHN-E3-P2,171.22

Nor was it she alone that prevailed; BEHN-E3-P2,171.23

<font> Aboan <$$font> and <font> Onahal <$$font> both pleaded,
BEHN-E3-P2,171.24

and both assured him of a lye that should be well enough contrived to
secure <font> Imoinda <$$font>.  So that at last, with a heart sad as
death, dying eyes, and sighing soul, <font> Oroonoko <$$font> departed,
and took his way to the camp.  BEHN-E3-P2,171.25

It was not long after, the king in person came to the otan; where
beholding <font> Imoinda <$$font>, with rage in his eyes, he upbraided
her wickedness, and perfidy; BEHN-E3-P2,171.26

and threatning her royal lover, she fell on her face at his feet,
bedewing the floor with her tears, and imploring his pardon for a fault
which she had not with her will committed; as <font> Onahal <$$font>,
who was also prostrate with her, could testify: That, unknown to her,
he had broke into her apartment, and ravished her.  BEHN-E3-P2,171.27

She spoke this much against her conscience; BEHN-E3-P2,171.28

but to save her own life, $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} absolutely necessary
she should feign this falsity.  BEHN-E3-P2,171.29

She knew it could not injure the prince, he being fled to an army
that would stand by him, against any injuries that should assault him.
BEHN-E3-P2,171.30

However this last thought of <font> Imoinda's <$$font> being ravished,
changed the <P_172> measures of his revenge; BEHN-E3-P2,172.31

and whereas before he designed to be himself her executioner, he now
resolved she should not die.  BEHN-E3-P2,172.32

But as it is the greatest crime in nature amongst'em, to touch a woman
after having been possess'd by a son, a father, or a brother.  so now
he looked on <font> Imoinda <$$font> as a polluted thing, wholly unfit
for his embrace; BEHN-E3-P2,172.33

nor would he resign her to his grandson, because she had received the
royal veil: BEHN-E3-P2,172.34

He therefore removes her from the otan, with <font> Onahal <$$font>;
whom he put into safe hands, with order they should be both sold off
as slaves to another country, either Christian or heathen, $'t $was
{TEXT:'twas} no matter where.  BEHN-E3-P2,172.35

This cruel sentence, worse than death, they implor'd might be reversed ;
BEHN-E3-P2,172.36

but their prayers were vain, BEHN-E3-P2,172.37

and it was put in execution accordingly, BEHN-E3-P2,172.38

and that with so much secrecy, that none, either without or within
the otan, knew any thing of their absence, or their destiny.
BEHN-E3-P2,172.39

The old king nevertheless executed this with a great deal of reluctancy
; BEHN-E3-P2,172.40

but he believed he had made a very great conquest over himself, when he
had once resolved, and had perform'd what he resolv'd.  BEHN-E3-P2,172.41

He believed now, that his love had been unjust; and that he cou'd not
expect the gods, or Captain of the Clouds <paren> as they call the unknown
power <$$paren> wou'd suffer a better consequence from so ill a cause.
BEHN-E3-P2,172.42

He now begins to hold <font> Oroonoko <$$font> excused; and to say,
he had reason for what he did: BEHN-E3-P2,172.43

And now every body cou'd assure the king how passionately <font> Imoinda
<$$font> was beloved by the prince; BEHN-E3-P2,172.44

even those confess'd it now, who said the contrary before his flame was
not abated.  So that the king being old, and not able to defend himself in
war, and having no sons of all his race remaining alive, but only this,
to maintain him on his throne; and looking on this as a man disobliged,
first by the rape of his mistress, or rather wife, and now by depriving
him wholly of her, he fear'd, might make him desperate, and do some
cruel thing, either to himself or his old grandfather the offender,
he began to repent him extremely of the contempt he had, in his rage,
put on <font> Imoinda.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,172.45

Besides <P_173> he consider'd he ought in honour to have killed her for
this offence, if it had been one.  BEHN-E3-P2,173.46

He ought to have had so much value and consideration for a maid of her
quality, as to have nobly put her to death, and not to have sold her like
a common slave; the greatest revenge, and the most disgraceful of any,
and to which they a thousand times prefer death, and implore it; as <font>
Imoinda <$$font> did, but cou'd not obtain that honour.  BEHN-E3-P2,173.47

Seeing therefore it was certain that <font> Oroonoko <$$font> would
highly resent this affront, he thought good to make some excuse for his
rashness to him; BEHN-E3-P2,173.48

and to that end, he sent a messenger to the camp, with orders to treat
with him about the matter, to gain his pardon, and to endeavour to
mitigate his grief; but that by no means he shou'd tell him she was sold,
but secretly put to death: BEHN-E3-P2,173.49

for he knew he should never obtain his pardon for the other.
BEHN-E3-P2,173.50

When the messenger came, he found the prince upon the point of engaging
with the enemy; BEHN-E3-P2,173.51

but as soon as he heard of the arrival of the messenger, he commanded
him to his tent, where he embraced him, and received him with joy:
which was soon abated by the down-cast looks of the messenger, who was
instantly demanded the cause by <font> Oroonoko <$$font>; who, impatient
of delay, ask'd a thousand questions in a breath, and all concerning
<font> Imoinda <$$font>.  BEHN-E3-P2,173.52

But there needed little return; BEHN-E3-P2,173.53

for he cou'd almost answer himself of all he demanded from his sighs
and eyes.  BEHN-E3-P2,173.54

At last the messenger casting himself at the prince's feet, and kissing
them with all the submission of a man that had something to implore which
he dreaded to utter, he besought him to hear with calmness what he had
to deliver to him, and to call up all his noble and heroick courage,
to encounter with his words, and defend himself against the ungrateful
things he must relate.  BEHN-E3-P2,173.55

<font> Oroonoko <$$font> reply'd, with a deep sigh, and a languishing
voice, - <font> I am armed against their worst efforts - BEHN-E3-P2,173.56

For I know they will tell me, <$$font> Imoinda <font> is no more -
BEHN-E3-P2,173.57

and after that, you may spare the rest.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,173.58

Then, commanding him to rise, he laid himself on a carpet, under a rich
pavilion, BEHN-E3-P2,173.59

and remained a good <P_174> while silent, BEHN-E3-P2,174.60

and was hardly heard to sigh.  BEHN-E3-P2,174.61

When he was come a little to himself, the messenger asked him leave to
deliver that part of his embassy which the prince had not yet divin'd:
BEHN-E3-P2,174.62

And the prince cry'd, <font> I permit thee <$$font> - BEHN-E3-P2,174.63

Then he told him the affliction the old king was in, for the rashness
he had committed in his cruelty to <font> Imoinda <$$font>; and how he
deign'd to ask pardon for his offence, and to implore the prince would
not suffer that loss to touch his heart too sensibly, which now all the
gods could not restore him, but might recompense him in glory, which
he begged he would pursue; and that death, that common revenger of all
injuries, would soon even the account between him and a feeble old man.
BEHN-E3-P2,174.64

<font> Oroonoko <$$font> bad him return his duty to his lord and master ;
and to assure him, there was no account of revenge to be adjusted between
them: BEHN-E3-P2,174.65

if there were, $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} he was the aggressor,
BEHN-E3-P2,174.66

and that death would be just, and, maugre his age, wou'd see him righted;
BEHN-E3-P2,174.67

and he was contented to leave his share of glory to youths more fortunate
and worthy of that favour from the gods: BEHN-E3-P2,174.68

That henceforth he would never lift a weapon, or draw a bow, but abandon
the small remains of his life to sighs and tears, and the continual
thoughts of what his lord and grandfather had thought good to send
out of the world, with all that youth, that innocence and beauty.
BEHN-E3-P2,174.69

After having spoken this, whatever his greatest officers and men of the
best rank cou'd do, they could not raise him from the carpet, or persuade
him to action, and resolutions of life; BEHN-E3-P2,174.70

but commanding all to retire, he shut himself into his pavilion all that
day, while the enemy was ready to engage: BEHN-E3-P2,174.71

and wondring at the delay, the whole body of the chief of the army then
address'd themselves to him, BEHN-E3-P2,174.72

and to whom they had much ado to get admittance.  BEHN-E3-P2,174.73

They fell on their faces at the foot of his carpet, where they lay,
BEHN-E3-P2,174.74

and besought him with earnest prayers and tears, to lead them forth
to battle, and not let the enemy take <P_175> advantages of them;
BEHN-E3-P2,175.75

and implored him to have regard to his glory, and to the world, that
depended on his courage and conduct.  BEHN-E3-P2,175.76

But he made no other reply to all their supplications, but this, That he
had now no more business for glory; and for the world, BEHN-E3-P2,175.77

it was a trifle not worth his care: BEHN-E3-P2,175.78

<font> Go <$$font> <paren> continued he, sighing <$$paren>
BEHN-E3-P2,175.79

<font> and divide it amongst you, BEHN-E3-P2,175.80

and reap with joy what you so vainly prize, BEHN-E3-P2,175.81

and leave me to my more welcome destiny.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,175.82

They then demanded what they should do, and whom he would constitute in
his room, that the confusion of ambitious youth and power might not ruin
their order, and make them a prey to the enemy.  BEHN-E3-P2,175.83

He reply'd, he would not give himself the trouble - but wished'em to
chuse the bravest man amongst'em, let his quality or birth be what it
wou'd: BEHN-E3-P2,175.84

<font> For, oh my friends!  <$$font> <paren> said he <$$paren> <font>
it is not titles make men brave or good; or birth that bestows courage
and generosity, or makes the owner happy.  BEHN-E3-P2,175.85

Believe this, when you behold <$$font> Oroonoko <font> the most wretched
, and abandoned by fortune, of all the creation of the gods.  <$$font>
BEHN-E3-P2,175.86

So turning himself about, he wou'd make no more reply to all they could
urge or implore.  BEHN-E3-P2,175.87

The army beholding their officers return unsuccessful, with sad faces
and ominous looks, that presaged no good luck, suffer'd a thousand
fears to take possession of their hearts, and the enemy to come even
upon them, before they would provide for their safety, by any defence :
BEHN-E3-P2,175.88

and though they were assured by some, who had a mind to animate them,
that they should be immediately headed by the prince, and that in the
mean time <font> Aboan <$$font> had orders to command as general; yet
they were so dismay'd for want of that great example of bravery , that
they could make but a very feeble resistance; and at last, downright
fled before the enemy, who pursued'em to the very tents, killing'em.
BEHN-E3-P2,175.89

Nor could all <font> Aboan's <$$font> courage, which that day gained
him immortal glory, shame'em into a manly defence of themselves.
BEHN-E3-P2,175.90

The guards that were left behind about the prince's tent, seeing the
soldiers flee before the enemy, and scatter themselves all over the plain
, in <P_176> great disorder, made such outcries as rouz'd the prince
from his amorous slumber, in which he had remain'd bury'd for two days,
without permitting any sustenance to approach him.  BEHN-E3-P2,176.91

But, in spight of all his resolutions, he had not the constancy of grief
to that degree, as to make him insensible of the danger of his army;
BEHN-E3-P2,176.92

and in that instant he leaped from his couch, BEHN-E3-P2,176.93

and cry'd - <font> Come, if we must die, let us meet death the noblest
way; BEHN-E3-P2,176.94

and $'t $will {TEXT:'twill} be more like <$$font> Oroonoko <font> to
encounter him at an army's head, opposing the torrent of a conquering foe
, than lazily on a couch, to wait his lingring pleasure, and die every
moment by a thousand racking thoughts; or be tamely taken by an enemy ,
and led a whining love-sick slave to adorn the triumphs of <$$font>
Jamoan, <font> that young victor, who already is enter'd beyond the
limits I have prescrib'd him.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,176.95

While he was speaking, he suffer'd his people to dress him for the field;
BEHN-E3-P2,176.96

and sallying out of his pavilion, with more life and vigour in his
countenance than ever he shew'd, he appear'd like some divine power
descended to save his country from destruction: BEHN-E3-P2,176.97

and his people had purposely put him on all things that might make him
shine with most splendor, to strike a reverend awe into the beholders.
BEHN-E3-P2,176.98

He flew into the thickest of those that were pursuing his men;
BEHN-E3-P2,176.99

and being animated with despair, he fought as if he came on purpose to
die, BEHN-E3-P2,176.100

and did such things as will not be believed that human strength could
perform; and such as soon inspir'd all the rest with new courage, and
new order.  BEHN-E3-P2,176.101

And now it was that they began to fight indeed; and so, as if they
would not be outdone even by their ador'd hero; who turning the tide of
the victory, changing absolutely the fate of the day, gain'd an entire
conquest: BEHN-E3-P2,176.102

and <font> Oroonoko <$$font> having the good fortune to single out <font>
Jamoan <$$font>, he took him prisoner with his own hand, having wounded
him almost to death.  BEHN-E3-P2,176.103

This <font> Jamoan <$$font> afterwards became very dear to him, being
a man very gallant, and of excellent graces, and fine parts; so that he
never put him amongst the rank <P_177> of captives, as they used to do,
without distinction, for the common sale, or market, but kept him in
his own court, where he retain'd nothing of the prisoner but the name,
and returned no more into his own country; BEHN-E3-P2,177.104

so great an affection he took for <font> Oroonoko <$$font>,
BEHN-E3-P2,177.105

and by a thousand tales and adventures of love and gallantry, flatter'd
his disease of melancholy and languishment: which I have often heard him
say, had certainly kill'd him, but for the conversation of this prince
and <font> Aboan <$$font>, and the <font> French <$$font> governour he
had from his childhood, of whom I have spoken before, and who was a man
of admirable wit, great ingenuity and learning; all which he had infused
into his young pupil.  BEHN-E3-P2,177.106

This <font> Frenchman <$$font> was banished out of his own country,
for some heretical notions he held: BEHN-E3-P2,177.107

and tho he was a man of very little religion, he had admirable morals,
and a brave soul.  BEHN-E3-P2,177.108

After the total defeat of <font> Jamoan's <$$font> army, which all fled
, or were left dead upon the place, they spent some time in the camp;
<font> Oroonoko <$$font> chusing rather to remain awhile there in his
tents, than to enter into a palace, or live in a court where he had so
lately suffer'd so great a loss.  BEHN-E3-P2,177.109

The officers therefore, who saw and knew his cause of discontent,
invented all sorts of diversions and sports to entertain their prince:
so that what with those amusements abroad, and others at home, that is
, within their tents, with the persuasions, arguments, and care of his
friends and servants that he more peculiarly priz'd, he wore off in time
a great part of that <font> chagreen <$$font>, and torture of despair,
which the first effects of <font> Imoinda's <$$font> death had given him;
insomuch as having received a thousand kind embassies from the king, and
invitation to return to court, he obey'd, tho with no little reluctancy:
BEHN-E3-P2,177.110

and when he did so, there was a visible change in him, BEHN-E3-P2,177.111

and for a long time he was much more melancholy than before.
BEHN-E3-P2,177.112

But time lessens all extremes, BEHN-E3-P2,177.113

and reduces'em to <font> mediums <$$font>, and unconcern:
BEHN-E3-P2,177.114

but no motives of beauties, tho all endeavour'd it, cou'd engage him in
any sort of amour, though he <P_178> had all the invitations to it, both
from his own youth, and others ambitions and designs.  BEHN-E3-P2,178.115

<font> Oroonoko <$$font> was no sooner return'd from this last conquest,
and receiv'd at court with all the joy and magnificence that could be
expressed to a young victor, who was not only returned triumphant,
but belov'd like a deity, than there arriv'd in the port an <font>
English ship.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,178.116

The master of it had often before been in these countries,
BEHN-E3-P2,178.117

and was very well known to <font> Oroonoko <$$font>, with whom he had
traffick'd for slaves, and had us'd to do the same with his predecessors.
BEHN-E3-P2,178.118

This commander was a man of a finer sort of address and conversation,
better bred, and more engaging, than most of that sort of men are;
so that he seem'd rather never to have been bred out of a court, than
{COM:to_have_been} almost all his life at sea.  BEHN-E3-P2,178.119

This captain therefore was always better receiv'd at court, than most of
the traders to those countries were; and especially by <font> Oroonoko
<$$font>, who was more civiliz'd, according to the <font> European
<$$font> mode, than any other had been, and took more delight in the
white nations; and, above all, men of parts and wit.  BEHN-E3-P2,178.120

To this captain he sold abundance of his slaves; BEHN-E3-P2,178.121

and for the favour and esteem he had for him, made him many presents,
BEHN-E3-P2,178.122

and oblig'd him to stay at court as long as possibly he cou'd.  Which the
captain seem'd to take as a very great honour done him, entertaining
the prince every day with globes and maps, and mathematical discourses
and instruments; eating, drinking, hunting, and living with him with so
much familiarity, that it was not to be doubted but he had gain'd very
greatly upon the heart of this gallant young man.  BEHN-E3-P2,178.123

And the captain, in return of all these mighty favours, besought the
prince to honour his vessel with his presence, some day or other at
dinner, before he shou'd set sail: which he condescended to accept,
and appointed his day.  BEHN-E3-P2,178.124

The captain, on his part, fail'd not to have all things in a readiness,
in the most magnificent order he could possibly: BEHN-E3-P2,178.125

And the day being come, the captain, in his boat, richly adorn'd with
carpets and velvet <P_179> cushions, row'd to the shore, to receive
the prince; with another long-boat, where was plac'd all his musick and
trumpets, with which <font> Oroonoko <$$font> was extremely delighted ;
who met him on the shore, attended by his <font> French <$$font> governor,
<font> Jamoan, Aboan, <$$font> and about an hundred of the noblest of
the youths of the court: BEHN-E3-P2,179.126

And after they had first carry'd the prince on board, the boats fetch'd
the rest off; where they found a very splendid treat, with all sorts of
fine wines; BEHN-E3-P2,179.127

and were as well entertain'd, as $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} possible in such
a place to be.  BEHN-E3-P2,179.128

The prince having drunk hard of punch, and several sorts of wine, as
did all the rest, <paren> for great care was taken, they shou'd want
nothing of that part of the entertainment <$$paren> was very merry,
and in great admiration of the ship, BEHN-E3-P2,179.129

for he had never been in one before; so that he was curious of beholding
every place where he decently might descend.  BEHN-E3-P2,179.130

The rest, no less curious, who were not quite overcome with drinking,
rambled at their pleasure fore and aft, as their fancies guided'em: So
that the captain, who had well laid his design before, gave the word,
BEHN-E3-P2,179.131

and seiz'd on all his guests; they clapping great irons suddenly on the
prince, when he was leap'd down into the hold, to view that part of the
vessel; BEHN-E3-P2,179.132

and locking him fast down, secur'd him.  BEHN-E3-P2,179.133

The same treachery was us'd to all the rest; BEHN-E3-P2,179.134

and all in one instant, in several places of the ship, were lash'd fast
in irons, and betray'd to slavery.  BEHN-E3-P2,179.135

That great design over, they set all hands to work to hoist sail;
BEHN-E3-P2,179.136

and with as treacherous as fair a wind they made from the shore with
this innocent and glorious prize, who thought of nothing less than such
an entertainment.  BEHN-E3-P2,179.137

Some have commended this act, as brave in the captain; BEHN-E3-P2,179.138

but I will spare my sense of it, and leave it to my reader to judge as
he pleases.  BEHN-E3-P2,179.139

It may be easily guess'd, in what manner the prince resented this
indignity, who may be best resembled to a lion taken in a toil;
BEHN-E3-P2,179.140

so he rag'd, BEHN-E3-P2,179.141

so he struggled for liberty, BEHN-E3-P2,179.142

but all in vain: BEHN-E3-P2,179.143

and they had so wisely manag'd his fetters, that he could not use a hand
in his defence to quit <P_180> himself of a life that wou'd by no means
endure slavery; BEHN-E3-P2,180.144

nor cou'd he move from the place where he was ty'd, to any solid part of
the ship against which he might have beat his head, and have finish'd
his disgrace that way.  So that being deprived of all other means,
he resolv'd to perish for want of food; BEHN-E3-P2,180.145

and pleas'd at last with that thought, and toil'd and tir'd by rage and
indignation, he laid himself down, BEHN-E3-P2,180.146

and sullenly resolv'd upon dying, BEHN-E3-P2,180.147

and refused all things that were brought him.  BEHN-E3-P2,180.148

This did not a little vex the captain, and the more so, because he found
almost all of'em of the same humour; so that the loss of so many brave
slaves, so tall and goodly to behold, would have been very considerable:
BEHN-E3-P2,180.149

He therefore order'd one to go from him <paren> for he would not be seen
himself <$$paren> to <font> Oroonoko <$$font>, and to assure him, he was
afflicted for having rashly done so unhospitable a deed, and which could
not be now remedy'd, since they were far from shore; BEHN-E3-P2,180.150

but since he resented it in so high a nature, he assur'd him he would
revoke his resolution, and set both him and his friends a-shore on the
next land they should touch at; BEHN-E3-P2,180.151

and of this the messenger gave him his oath, provided he would resolve
to live.  BEHN-E3-P2,180.152

And <font> Oroonoko <$$font>, whose honour was such as he never had
violated a word in his life himself, much less a solemn asseveration,
believ'd in an instant what this man said; BEHN-E3-P2,180.153

but reply'd, He expected, for a confirmation of this, to have his shameful
fetters dismiss'd.  BEHN-E3-P2,180.154

This demand was carried to the captain; who return'd him answer, That the
offence had been so great which he had put upon the prince, that he durst
not trust him with liberty while he remain'd in the ship , for fear lest
by a valour natural to him, and a revenge that would animate that valour,
he might commit some outrage fatal to himself, and the king his master,
to whom this vessel did belong.  BEHN-E3-P2,180.155

To this Oroonoko reply'd, He would engage his honour to behave himself
in all friendly order and manner, and obey the command of the captain
, as he was lord of the king's vessel, and general of those men under
his command.  BEHN-E3-P2,180.156

<P_181>

This was deliver'd to the still doubting captain, who could not resolve
to trust a heathen, he said, upon his parole, a man that had no sense
or notion of the God that he worshipp'd.  BEHN-E3-P2,181.158

<font> Oroonoko <$$font> then reply'd, He was very sorry to hear that
the captain pretended to the knowledge and worship of any Gods, who
had taught him no better principles, than not to credit as he would
be credited.  BEHN-E3-P2,181.159

But they told him, the difference of their faith occasion'd that distrust
: BEHN-E3-P2,181.160

For the captain had protested to him upon the word of a Christian, and
sworn in the name of a great God; which if he should violate, he would
expect eternal torment in the world to come.  BEHN-E3-P2,181.161

<font> Is that all the obligation he has to be just to his oath?  <$$font>
<paren> reply'd <font> Oroonoko <$$font> <$$paren> BEHN-E3-P2,181.162

<font> Let him know, I swear by my honour; which to violate, would not
only render me contemptible and despised by all brave and honest men,
and so give my self perpetual pain, but it would be eternally offending
and displeasing all mankind; harming, betraying, circumventing and
outraging all men.  BEHN-E3-P2,181.163

But punishments hereafter are sufer'd by one's self; BEHN-E3-P2,181.164

and the world takes no cognizance whether this GOD have reveng'd'em,
or not, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} done so secretly, and deferr'd so long:
while the man of no honour suffers every moment the scorn and contempt
of the honester world, and dies every day ignominiously in his fame,
which is more valuable than life.  BEHN-E3-P2,181.165

I speak not this to move belief, but to shew you how you mistake, when
you imagine, That he who will violate his honour, will keep his word
with his Gods.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,181.166

So, turning from him with a disdainful smile, he refused to answer him,
when he urged him to know what answer he should carry back to his captain
; so that he departed without saying any more.  BEHN-E3-P2,181.167

The captain pondering and consulting what to do, it was concluded that
nothing but <font> Oroonoko <$$font>'s liberty would encourage any of
the rest to eat, except the <font> Frenchman <$$font>, whom the captain
could not pretend to keep prisoner, but only told him, he was secured,
because he might act something in favour of the prince, but that he
should be freed as soon as they came to <P_182> land.  So that they
concluded it wholly necessary to free the prince from his irons, that
he might shew himself to the rest; that they might have an eye upon him,
and that they could not fear a single man.  BEHN-E3-P2,182.168

This being resolv'd, to make the obligation the greater, the captain
himself went to <font> Oroonoko <$$font>; where, after many compliments
, and assurances of what he had already promis'd, he receiving from the
prince his parole, and his hand, for his good behaviour, dismiss'd his
irons, and brought him to his own cabin; where, after having treated and
repos'd him a while, <paren> for he had neither eat nor slept in four
days before <$$paren> he besought him to visit those obstinate people
in chains, who refus'd all manner of sustenance; and intreated him to
oblige'em to eat, and assure'em of their liberty on the first opportunity.
BEHN-E3-P2,182.169

<font> Oroonoko <$$font>, who was too generous, not to give credit to his
words, shew'd himself to his people, who were transported with excess
of joy at the sight of their darling prince; falling at his feet ,
and kissing and embracing him; believing, as some divine oracle, all
he assur'd'em.  BEHN-E3-P2,182.170

But he besought'em to bear their chains with that bravery that became
those whom he had seen act so nobly in arms; and that they could not
give him greater proofs of their love and friendship, since $'t $was
{TEXT:'twas} all the security the captain <paren> his friend <$$paren>
could have, against the revenge, he said, they might possibly justly take,
for the injuries sustain'd by him.  BEHN-E3-P2,182.171

And they all, with one accord, assur'd him, they cou'd not suffer enough,
when it was for his repose and safety.  BEHN-E3-P2,182.172

After this, they no longer refus'd to eat, BEHN-E3-P2,182.173

but took what was brought'em, BEHN-E3-P2,182.174

and were pleas'd with their captivity, since by it they hoped to redeem
the prince, who, all the rest of the voyage, was treated with all the
respect due to his birth, tho nothing could divert his melancholy; and he
would often sigh for <font> Imoinda <$$font>, and think this a punishment
due to his misfortune, in having left that noble maid behind him, that
fatal night, in the otan, when he fled to the camp.  BEHN-E3-P2,182.175

<P_183>

Possess'd with a thousand thoughts of past joys with this fair young
person, and a thousand griefs for her eternal loss, he endur'd a tedious
voyage, BEHN-E3-P2,183.177

and at last arriv'd at the mouth of the river of <font> Surinam <$$font>
, a colony belonging to the king of <font> England <$$font>, and where
they were to deliver some part of their slaves.  BEHN-E3-P2,183.178

There the merchants and gentlemen of the country going on board, to
demand those lots of slaves they had already agreed on; and, amongst
those, the overseers of those plantations where I then chanc'd to be:
the captain, who had given the word, order'd his men to bring up those
noble slaves in fetters, whom I have spoken of; BEHN-E3-P2,183.179

and having put'em, some in one, and some in other lots, with women and
children <paren> which they call pickaninies <$$paren> they sold 'em off,
as slaves, to several merchants and gentlemen; not putting any two in one
lot, because they would separate'em far from each other ; nor daring to
trust'em together, lest rage and courage should put 'em upon contriving
some great action, to the ruin of the colony.  BEHN-E3-P2,183.180

<font> Oroonoko <$$font> was first seiz'd on, and sold to our overseer
, who had the first lot, with seventeen more of all sorts and sizes,
but not one of quality with him.  BEHN-E3-P2,183.181

When he saw this, he found what they meant; BEHN-E3-P2,183.182

for, as I said, he understood <font> English <$$font> pretty well;
BEHN-E3-P2,183.183

and being wholly unarm'd and defenceless, so as it was in vain to make
any resistance, he only beheld the captain with a look all fierce and
disdainful, upbraiding him with eyes that forc'd blushes on his guilty
cheeks, BEHN-E3-P2,183.184

he only cry'd in passing over the side of the ship; <font> Farewell,
sir, BEHN-E3-P2,183.185

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} worth my sufferings, to gain so true a knowledge both
of you, and of your gods by whom you swear.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,183.186

And desiring those that held him to forbear their pains, and telling'em
he would make no resistance, he cry'd, <font> Come, my fellow-slaves ,
BEHN-E3-P2,183.187

let us descend, and see if we can meet with more honour and honesty in
the next world we shall touch upon.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-P2,183.188

So he nimbly leapt into the boat, BEHN-E3-P2,183.189

and shewing no more concern, suffer'd himself to be row'd up the river,
with his seventeen companions.  BEHN-E3-P2,183.190

<P_184>

The gentleman that bought him, was a young <font> Cornish <$$font>
gentleman, whose name was <font> Trefry <$$font>; a man of great wit,
and fine learning, BEHN-E3-P2,184.192

and was carry'd into those parts by the Lord-Governour, to manage all
his affairs.  BEHN-E3-P2,184.193

He reflecting on the last words of <font> Oroonoko <$$font> to the captain
, and beholding the richness of his vest, no sooner came into the boat
, but he fix'd his eyes on him; and finding something so extraordinary
in his face, his shape and mein, a greatness of look, and haughtiness
in his air, and finding he spoke <font> English <$$font>, had a great
mind to be enquiring into his quality and fortune: which, though <font>
Oroonoko <$$font> endeavour'd to hide, by only confessing he was above
the rank of common slaves; <font> Trefry <$$font> soon found he was
yet something greater than he confess'd; and from that moment began to
conceive so vast an esteem for him, that he ever after lov'd him as his
dearest brother, and shew'd him all the civilities due to so great a man.
