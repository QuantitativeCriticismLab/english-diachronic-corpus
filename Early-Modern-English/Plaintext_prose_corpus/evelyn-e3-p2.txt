I went after all publique devotions were finish'd to visite the Bishop
of St. Asaph <paren> the Queens Almoner who was now entered upon
the sole Regal Government during her husbands Absence <$$paren> where
was the Bishops of Lond. & Worcester & Deane of Paules Dr Tenison
&c: all of them not a little surpriz'd at what had happned in <font>
Savoy <$$font>, among the <font> Voudois <$$font>, who being so neere
their destruction & final extirpation by the French, as that they were
generaly given up as to slaughter, & that every body expected to heare
of their calamities & final destruction: It pleased God $that the Duke of
<P_926> Savoy <paren> hitherto joyning with the French in persecution of
those poore Christians, & now pressed by the French to deliver $Verrue &
Turin as Cautionary to the French, upon their suspicion that he might at
last come into the German Princes Confederacy <$$paren> having seacretly
concerted with the Confederats, & adjusted the Condition &c, not onely
declared for the Confederats, but invited those poore Christians from
their <font> dispersions & Latebrae <$$font> among the Mountain whither
they had fled; but restor'd them to their Country, Dwellings, Exercise of
the Religion, beged pardon for the ill usage they had received, & charging
it upon the cruelty of the French, who forced him to it &c: These being
the Remainder of those persecuted Christians, $whom the Bishop had so
long time, affirmed to be the 2 Wittnesses spoken of in the Revelation
who should be Kild, & brought to life againe; EVELYN-E3-P2,926.73

It was looked on as an extraordinary thing; That this Prophetique Bish:
should perswade two fugitive Ministers of the <font> Vodois <$$font>
to returne to their Country, & furnish them with 20 pounds towards their
journey, at that very time, when it was believed nothing but universal
destruction was to be expected, assuring them, & shewing them from the
Text in the Apocalypse that their Country men should be returned safely
to their Country, before they arived, let them make what hast they could:
EVELYN-E3-P2,926.74

This so hapning contrary to all expectation & appearance, did exceedingly
credit the Bishops Confidence how that prophesy of the Witnesses,
should so come to passe, so just at the time & very moneth of which he
had spoken some yeares before: EVELYN-E3-P2,926.75

I went afterwards with him to visite Mr. Boyle & Lady Ranelagh
his sister, to whom he explaind the necessity of its so falling out by
the Scriptures in a very wonderfull manner, which he most skillfully &
learnedly made out; with what events were immediately to follow of the
French Kings ruine, The Turkes, & Calling of the Jewes to be neere at
hand; but that the total Kingdom of Antichrist, would yet not be utterly
destroyed til 30 years, when Christ $should begin the Milennium , not as
himselfe $personally reigning in Earth Visibly; but that the true Religion
& universal peace, should obtaine thro all the world: EVELYN-E3-P2,926.76

he shewed how Mr. Brightman, Mr. Meade, and other
Interpreters of their Events, failed, by mistaking & reckoning the yeares
as the Latines & others did, to consist of the present Calculation &
so many <P_927> dayes to the yeare; wheras, the Apocalyps, reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did whose Visions St. John
all along explains, as meaning onely the Christian Church: &c.
EVELYN-E3-P2,927.77

the next day to <font> Althorp <$$font> in Northampton shire, it being
70 miles, which in 2 Coaches one $of $4 $horses that $tooke me & my son
up at white-hall & carried us to Dunstaple, where we arived & dined at
noone, & another there of 6 horses, which carried us to Althorp 4 miles
beyond N-hampton, by 7 a clocke that evening; EVELYN-E3-P2,886.220

both these Coaches laied for me alone, by that noble Countesse of
Sunderland, who Invited me to her house at Althorp, where she entertaind
me & my son with very extraordinary kindnesse, and convey'd us back
againe to London in the very same noble manner, both going & coming,
appointing a Dinner for us at Dunstaple, which we found ready for us,
as soone as we came to the Inn: EVELYN-E3-P2,886.221

I stayed with her Ladyship'til the Thursday following.
EVELYN-E3-P2,886.222

18 EVELYN-E3-P2,886.223

Dr. Jessup the Minister of Althorp, who was my Lords Chaplaine
, when Ambassador in France, preached on {COM:lacuna_in_edition} the
shortest discourse I ever heard: EVELYN-E3-P2,886.224

but what was defective in the amplitude of his sermon, we found supplied
in the largenesse, & convenience of the Parsonage house, which the
Doctor <paren> who had in spiritual advancements, at least 600 pounds per
Annum <$$paren> had new-built, fit for any person of quality to live in,
with Gardens & all accommodations according.  EVELYN-E3-P2,886.225

20 EVELYN-E3-P2,886.226

My Lady carried us to {COM:lacuna_in_edition} my Lord of Northamptons
Seate, a very strong large house built of stone, not altogether modern :
EVELYN-E3-P2,886.227

they were now inlarging the Gardens, in which was nothing extraordinary
but the Yron gate, opening into the Parke, which is indeede
very good worke, wrought in flowers, painted with blew & gilded;
EVELYN-E3-P2,886.228

& there is a very noble Walke of Elmes towards the front of the house
by the Bowling Greene: EVELYN-E3-P2,886.229

I was not in any roomes of the house besides a lobby looking into the
Garden, where my Lord, and his new Countesse <paren> Sir St: Foxes
daughter, whom I had known from a very Child <$$paren> entertained
the Countesse of Sunderland & her daughter the Countesse of Arran,
<paren> newly married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton <$$paren>
with so little good grace, & so dully, that our Visite was very short,
EVELYN-E3-P2,886.230

& so we return'd to Althorp: which is 12 miles distant:
EVELYN-E3-P2,886.231

The Earle of Sunderlands House, or rather palace at Althorp, is a noble
uniforme pile, in forme of an {COM:graphic_omitted} built of brick &
freestone, balustred, & a la moderne; EVELYN-E3-P2,886.232

The Hale is well, the Staircase incomparable <P_887> the roomes of State

EVELYN-E3-P2,887.233

It is situated in the midst of Gardens, exquisitely planted & kept,
EVELYN-E3-P2,887.234

& all this in a parke wall'd with hewn stone; planted with rows & walkes
of Trees; Canales & fish ponds; stored with Game: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.235

& what is above all this, Govern'd by a Lady, that without any shew of
solicitude; keepes every thing in such admirable order both within &
without, from the Garret, to the Cellar; That I do not believe there
is any in all this nation or any other, exceeds her: all is in such
exact order, without ostentation, but substantialy greate & noble;
EVELYN-E3-P2,887.236

The meanest servant lodged so neate & cleanely, EVELYN-E3-P2,887.237

The Services at the several Tables, the good order & decenccy,

in a word the intire Oeconomie perfectly becoming, a wise & noble person
, & one whom for her distinguishing esteeme of me, from a long & worthy
friendship; I must ever honour & Celebrate: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.239

& wish, I do from my Soule; The Lord her Husband <paren> whose parts &
$abilities are otherwise conspicuous <$$paren> were as worthy of her,
as by a fatal Apostacy, & Court ambition, he has made himselfe unworthy
: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.240

This is what she deplores, EVELYN-E3-P2,887.241

& renders her as much affliction, as a Lady of a greate Soule & much
prudence is capable of: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.242

The Countesse of Bristol her mother, a grave & honorable Lady has the
comfort of seing her daughter & Grand-children under the same Oeconomie,
especialy, Mr. Charles Spencer, a Youth of extraordinary hopes,
very learned for his age & ingenious, & under a Governor of Extraordinary
worth: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.243

Happy were it, could as much be said, $of the Elder Bro: the Lord Spencer,
who rambling about the world, dishonors both his name & family , adding
sorrow to sorrow, to a Mother; who has taken all imaginable care of his
Education: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.244

but vice more & more predominating, gives slender hopes of his
reformation: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.245

He has another sister very Young, married to the Earle of Clancartie to
a greate & fair Estate in Ireland, which $yet gives no greate presage
of worth; so universaly contaminated is the youth of this corrupt &
abandoned age: EVELYN-E3-P2,887.246

But this is againe recompens'd by my <font> Lord Arran <$$font>, a sober

report of the Pr: of Oranges landing, which put White-hall into so panic
a feare, that I could hardly believe it possible to find such a change:
EVELYN-E3-P2,888.274

Writs issued now in order to the Parliament, & a declaration to back the
good order of Elections, with greate professions of maintaining <P_889>

people, who now began to shew their high discontent at several things

shewing the Scripture to be our undoubted & onely Rule of Faith, & its
perfection above all other Traditions & Writings, most excellently proved;
after which the Communion was celebrated to neere 1000 devout people.
EVELYN-E3-P2,889.295

This sermon chiefly occasioned by an impertinent Jesuite who in their
Masse-house the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture & railed at
our Translation with extraordinary ignorance and impudence; which some
present contradicting, they pulled him out of the Pulpit, & treated him
very coursely, insomuch as it was like to create a very greate disturbance
in the Citty: EVELYN-E3-P2,889.296

Hourely dreate on expectation of the Pr: of Oranges Invasion still

& retaines the Jesuites about him, which gave no satisfaction to the
nation, but increasing the universal discontent, brought people to so
desperate a passe as with uttmost expressions even passionately seeme
to long for & desire the landing of that Prince, whom they looked on
as their deliverer from popish Tyrannie, praying uncessantly for an
Easterly Wind, which was said to be the onely remora of his expedition,
with a numerous Army ready to make a descent; EVELYN-E3-P2,890.301

To such a strange temper & unheard of in any former age, was this poore

It is conceiv'd he grew remisse of late in pursuing the Interest of the

some reported one thing, some another; EVELYN-E3-P2,891.336

There was a Council now cald, to which were summon'd the A:Bish of

Q: Dowager, all the Ladies & Lords, who were present at the Q: Consorts
labour, upon oath to give testimonie of the Pr: of Wales's birth, which

This procedure was censur'd by some, as below his Majestie to condescend
to, upon the talke of Idle people: EVELYN-E3-P2,891.340

Remarkable on this occasion, was the refusal of the A Bish Marq: Halifax
, Earles of Clarendon & Notinghams refusing to sit at the Council Table
in their places, amongst Papists, & their bold telling his Majestie that
what ever was don whilst such sate amongst them was unlawfull, & incurr'd

A Man was taken with divers papers & printed Manifests, & carried to

There was likewise a declaration of the States, for satisfaction of all

the Prince with their Vessels & Militia on this Expedition, which was
delivered to all the Ambassadors & publique Ministers at the Hague except
to the English & French: EVELYN-E3-P2,892.361

There was in that of the Princes, an expression as if the Lords both
Spiritual & Temporal &c had invited him over, with a deduction of the
Causes of his enterprise: EVELYN-E3-P2,892.362

This made his Majestie Convene my L: of <font> Cant: <$$font> & the other
