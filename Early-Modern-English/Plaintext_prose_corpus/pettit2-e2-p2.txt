London PETTIT2-E2-P2,39.15

this IX=th= of June 1628 PETTIT2-E2-P2,39.16

Couzin, I Receaved your letter in a letter of my brother Paules, wherein
hee gave me order for the paymente of XX=li= unto Mr. Newman for
you; PETTIT2-E2-P2,39.17

presentely after the receipte of your letter I met with Mr.
Newman in Fish Streete, unto $whome <P_40> I remembred your love
PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.18

and told him that I had order to pay him his money, the which I
tolld him I would bringe him in the afternoone or the next morninge.
PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.19

I wente in the afternoone to speake with my couzin Richard,
PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.20

but his Master beeinge in the shopp I could not have soe much Conference
with him <paren> I meane with my couzin <$$paren> as I intended.
Soe that the nexte morninge I wente thither agayne.  PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.21

Mr. Newman beinge buisie above stayers with a Customer, I had
som speech with his prentesses and afterwards with my cousin Richard,
after which discourse, thoughe I helde oute parte of the money, yet I
put it up agayne, and spake unto my cousin to speake unto his fellowes
not to let ther Master know that I brought the money.  PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.22

I must needes say that, both by my Cousin Richard's words and also by
his fellowes, I perceve that the Master is much alterd since hee hath
beene marryed.  PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.23

For they all say that, through her dyssuadinge him, hee is brought to
such a pass that hee will beate them for any smale occasion, the which
I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} approve of, PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.24

and if I had knowne that hee would have provd soe It should have been
farre from mee from wishinge of your sonn unto him; PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.25

there is a greate many have beene deseaved in him besides myselfe,
PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.26

I mean in Mr. Newman.  PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.27

I have much wondred that your sonn spake noe thinge of this usadge when
you bounde him, nor unto mee, PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.28

for I have divers times since questioned with him, PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.29

but hee alwayes telld mee that hee liked his Master well but his Mistris
was somthinge a strange kynde of wooman.  Where upon I thoughte with
myselfe, in regard if hee liketh well of his Master the matter is not
greate, PETTIT2-E2-P2,40.30

for moste of London mistrisses ar strange kynde of woomen.
