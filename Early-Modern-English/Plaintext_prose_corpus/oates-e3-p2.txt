Council-Table, does he say?  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.161

hang them {COM:sic} Rogues; OATES-E3-P2,4.87.163

OATES-E3-P2,4.87.164

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where did you live then?
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.198

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> I lived at <font> Fulford <$$font> then.

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What, with Mr.
<font> Lowe?  <$$font> - OATES-E3-P2,4.87.200

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord.  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.201

<font> Oates.  <$$font> It seems he was a Servant to a Papist.
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.202

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What then,
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.203

what of that?  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.204

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, I desire you would ask him, whether he
ever saw <font> Ireland <$$font> before the 31st of <font> August <$$font>
which he speaks of?  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.205

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> No, I did not.  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.206

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But you are sure it was
the same Man you saw executed?  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.207

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> Yes, I am sure of it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.208

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> What Circumstance can

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> It was upon a <font> Sunday <$$font>, my Lord.

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Was that about <font>
Pancrass <$$font> Fair-time?  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.214

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, it was.  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.215

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> He can tell you
another Circumstance how he comes to remember him at Mr. <font>
Lowe <$$font>'s the 31st of <font> August <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.87.216

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay, by what Token do
you remember that he was there the 31st of <font> August?  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.217

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> I went that Day to {COM:lacuna_in_text} pay
some Money, OATES-E3-P2,4.87.218

<font> Oates.  <$$font> How does he say he knows him to be the same Man?
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.221

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He has told you twice,

Mr. <font> King.  <$$font> I saw Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>

the 1st of <font> September <$$font>, that Year that the Plot broke out,

There I saw him on <font> Sunday <$$font>; OATES-E3-P2,4.87.230

Mr. <font> King.  <$$font> He designed to go to <font> Boscobel

and Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> upon <font> Saturday <$$font>
Night came to my Master's House, OATES-E3-P2,4.87.252

OATES-E3-P2,4.87.253

<font> Lee.  <$$font> It was in 78; OATES-E3-P2,4.87.256

It was on a <font> Saturday <$$font> he came, OATES-E3-P2,4.87.258

and I have Witnesses to prove I was there at that time.
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.259

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Month was it?
OATES-E3-P2,4.87.260

<P_4.88>

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> That was the 2d of

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How do you know he went

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, I desire to know how long this Man was

OATES-E3-P2,4.88.275

was this Gentleman there at that time?  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.285

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, I did see him there.
OATES-E3-P2,4.88.286

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was that the same Man
that was executed, which you saw at Mr. <font> Gerrard <$$font>
's?  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.287

<font> Proctor.  <$$font> Yes, it was.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.288

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you dine with Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font> on <font> Monday <$$font> at Mrs. <font>
Crompton <$$font>'s?  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.289

<font> Lee.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, I did, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.290

and went afterwards with him to <font> Pancrass <$$font>,
OATES-E3-P2,4.88.291

and staid there two Hours, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.292

and then he went to <font> Boscobel <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.293

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> There are the two Days
gone which Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> swore to, and in which he was
so positive that it was either the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font>.

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Pray, Sir, when did you
see Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>, and where?  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.297

<font> Biddolph.  <$$font> My Lord, I was in <font> Staffordshire <$$font>
the latter end of <font> August <$$font> and the beginning of <font>
September <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.298

and I was at Mrs. <font> Crompton <$$font>'s House, which is my
Aunt, the 2d of <font> September <$$font> being <font> Monday <$$font> ,
where I saw Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>, and dined with him that
day; OATES-E3-P2,4.88.299

and after Dinner he went with Mr. <font> Gerrard <$$font> 's Son,
who was to go to School to <font> Boscobel <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.300

And I will give your Lordship a particular Circumstance that may satisfy
you that I am not mistaken in the time: OATES-E3-P2,4.88.301

As I came through <font> Northhamptonshire <$$font> that Summer, I was
at my Lord <font> Cullen <$$font>'s, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.302

and he desired me to be at a Horse-Race at <font> Newton-Slade <$$font>,
where there is a Plate always run for the first <font> Thursday <$$font>
in <font> September <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.303

and that Year it was the 5th of <font> September <$$font>.
OATES-E3-P2,4.88.304

Now when I dined at my Aunt <font> Crompton <$$font>'s, she would have
had me staid all Night at her House, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.305

but I excused myself, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.306

and told her I had promised to come to my Lord <font> Cullen <$$font>
's to be at the Race, and must needs be there before, to be as good as
my Word to my Lord; OATES-E3-P2,4.88.307

and therefore I went away to <font> Pancross <$$font>, and so on my
Journey, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.308

otherwise I had staid with my Aunt all Night: OATES-E3-P2,4.88.309

and I am sure this was <font> Monday <$$font> before this Horse-Race.
OATES-E3-P2,4.88.310

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, this Gentleman speaks to no Year
particularly.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.311

<font> Biddolph.  <$$font> It was in 1678, the Year before Mr.
<font> Oates <$$font>'s Plot broke out.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.312

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Now we will call
Mrs. <font> Crompton <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.313

Millage <$$font> in <font> Staffordshire <$$font> at Dinner, the
same Day that my Nephew <font> Biddolph <$$font> did dine there:
OATES-E3-P2,4.88.317

As for the Day of the Month, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} so well tell it,
because when my Friends dine with me, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} use to
note down the Day particularly; OATES-E3-P2,4.88.318

but it was, I remember, a pretty remarkable time, OATES-E3-P2,4.88.319

for it was about <font> Pancrass <$$font> -Fair.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.320

Mr. <font> Gerrard <$$font> of <font> Hildersham <$$font> came

OATES-E3-P2,4.88.323

He never was at my House before nor after; OATES-E3-P2,4.88.324

occasion to do it, as I had none at this time.  OATES-E3-P2,4.88.331

when Mrs. <font> Harwell <$$font> swears he came back to <font>
Wolverhampton <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.376

Mr. <font> Hanses.  <$$font> When did you see Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font>, Mr. <font> Pendrel?  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.377

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> I saw him upon the 2d of <font>
September <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.378

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Where did you see him?
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.379

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> At <font> Boscobel <$$font> at my
House, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.380

there he lodg'd with me that Night.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.381

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> In what Year was it?
- OATES-E3-P2,4.89.382

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> In the Year 1678.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.383

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Was it the <font>
September <$$font> before the Plot, and before Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> was executed?  - OATES-E3-P2,4.89.384

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, it was.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.385

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you know him before?
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.386

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> No, I did never see him before,
as I know of.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.387

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How long did he stay there?
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.388

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> He staid that Night and the next
Day all day, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.389

and went away the 4th of <font> September <$$font> to <font> Black-Ladies
<$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.390

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Whose House is that?
- OATES-E3-P2,4.89.391

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> It is Mr. <font> John
Gifford <$$font>'s.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.392

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You say you live at <font>
Boscobel <$$font>; OATES-E3-P2,4.89.393

Did you hear any thing of a Letter came to your House for Mr.
<font> Ireland?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.89.394

Mr. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> Not that I know of, my Lord,
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.395

there was not any that I remember.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.396

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Then swear Mrs.
<font> Pendrel.  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.89.397

<bracket> <font> Which was done.  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.89.398

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Pray, Mistress, will
you give an Account where you saw Mr. <font> Ireland?  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.399

Mrs. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> I saw him at <font> Boscobel
<$$font>, at the Royal Oak; OATES-E3-P2,4.89.400

he came there the 2d Day of <font> September <$$font>.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.401

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> Can you tell what
Year it was?  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.402

Mrs. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> It was the first Beginning of
the Plot.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.403

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> How long did he
stay there?  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.404

Mrs. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> He staid <font> Tuesday <$$font>
, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.405

and <font> Wednesday <$$font> he went to <font> Black-Ladies <$$font>
, and so away to <font> Wolverhampton <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.406

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> We have but one
Witness more, my Lord, for <font> Wednesday <$$font> the 4th of <font>
September <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.407

and then we have done.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.408

Swear Mr. <font> Charles Gifford <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.409

<bracket> <font> Which was done.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.410

When did you see Mr. <font> Ireland?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.89.411

Mr. <font> C. Gifford.  <$$font> May it please your
Lordship, I saw Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> at my Father's House
at <font> Black-Ladies - OATES-E3-P2,4.89.412

Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, I would ask Mrs. <font> Pendrel <$$font>
a Question before she goes: Whether she was not a Witness at the five
Jesuits Trial {COM:sic_punctuation}?  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.413

Mrs. <font> Pendrel.  <$$font> I was in Court, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.414

but they would not suffer me to swear.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.415

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Did she not give Evidence there?
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.416

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> She was examined,
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.417

but she could not be sworn, because she came to testify against the King
in a capital Cause.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.418

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Pray, what say you,
Mr. <font> Charles Gifford?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.89.419

Mr. <font> C. Gifford.  <$$font> My Lord, I say I saw
Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> at my Father's House in <font>
Black-Ladies <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.420

and he staid there an Hour and an half, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.421

and went through <font> Chillington <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.422

and said he would go to <font> Wolverhampton <$$font>.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.423

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> What Day of the Month
was it?  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.424

Mr. <font> C. Gifford.  <$$font> I am morally certain it
was the 4th of <font> September <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.425

and so he went to <font> Wolverhampton <$$font>, as I am informed.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.426

He came to our House to see a Lady that was there.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.427

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What Lady was it?  -
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.428

Mr. <font> C. Gifford.  <$$font> It was one Madam <font>
Wells <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.429

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Thus, my Lord, we have
lodged him the 4th of <font> September <$$font> at <font> Wolverhampton
<$$font>, when Mrs. <font> Harwell <$$font> says, he return'd to
her; OATES-E3-P2,4.89.430

and so, my Lord, we have given an Account where he was from the 3d
of <font> August <$$font> to the 14th of <font> September <$$font>.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.431

Mr. <font> Sol. Gen. <$$font> We have prov'd where
he was every Day in that time, but only the 8th of <font> September
<$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.432

and for that we must leave it to the Jury.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.433

We have proved that he came away from Mrs. <font> Harwell <$$font>
's the 7th, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.434

and he said he was to go to <font> Tixhall <$$font>; OATES-E3-P2,4.89.435

and the 9th he did go from <font> Tixhall <$$font> in Sir <font> John
Southcoat <$$font>'s Company, OATES-E3-P2,4.89.436

and came to <font> London <$$font> the 14th.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.437

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well, what say you to it,
Mr. <font> Oates?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.89.438

<font> Oates <$$font>.  Has Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> done
his Evidence, my Lord?  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.439

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> We shall call
no more Witnesses, unless you go about to support your own Credit,
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.440

and then we have other Witnesses to call.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.441

<font> Oates.  <$$font> I do not value any Witnesses you can bring
against my Credit.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.442

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Well, for the present,
we do not design to call any more Witnesses.  - OATES-E3-P2,4.89.443

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then let us hear what you
say to it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.444

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, here is an Indictment against me, which
sets forth, that I should swear at Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>'s
Trial, that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was in Town the 1st and
2d of <font> September <$$font>; OATES-E3-P2,4.89.445

and it sets forth, that in truth he was not in Town: OATES-E3-P2,4.89.446

And likewise it sets forth, that I swore at the Trial of the five Jesuits,
that Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> took his leave of me and others
here in Town at his Lodging in <font> Russel-street <$$font>, between
the 8th and 12th of <font> August: <$$font> whereas the Perjury there
assigned, is this, That he did not take his Leave of me, or any other
Person, betwixt the 8th and 12th of <font> August <$$font> , at his
Lodging in <font> Russel-Street <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.447

Now, my Lord, I was not the only Witness of Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font>'s being in Town in the Month of <font> August <$$font>,
nor the only Witness of his being in Town about that time in <font>
September <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.448

My Lord, my Prosecutors have endeavoured to maintain this Charge against
me thus: OATES-E3-P2,4.89.449

The first thing they have gone upon, as far as I can remember in
the Indictment, is as to the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font>,
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.450

or rather, they have endeavoured to prove both under one.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.451

Now, in answer to all this Evidence, my Lord, the first thing I shall
offer to your Lordship's Consideration, and the Consideration of the
Jury, is the great Hardship I lie under, after six Years time, to be
put to disprove what the Counsel here have now offered against me.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.452

My Lord, I observe first, that this Indictment, which is now upon Trial,
is founded upon the Trial of <font> Ireland <$$font>, which was the 17th
of <font> December <$$font> 1678, at the <font> Old-Bailey <$$font>,
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.453

and it is now six Years after that Evidence of mine was delivered.
OATES-E3-P2,4.89.454

A second thing is, that the Indictment is found by special Commission,
as appears by the Indictment itself.  OATES-E3-P2,4.89.455

Now, I must recommend to the Consideration of your Lordship and this
Jury, why the Prosecution of this pretended Perjury has been delay'd so
long, when it appears by the Evidence which has been produced, that the
Witnesses to prove it were known six Years since, as <P_4.90> much as
they are now; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.456

and there is no colour of Evidence offered, that any new Fact has been
lately discovered which was not then knowne.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.457

There is no Reason, my Lord, that is assigned, or can be assigned for
this Delay, but only that the Hardship might be the greater upon me:
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.458

For now it is difficult, if not impossible for me to maintain the Evidence
I then gave, so many Persons being since dead, or gone beyond the Seas,
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.459

and many things that were fresh then, are now grown out of Memory;
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.460

and I beg your Favour to insist upon this, OATES-E3-P2,4.90.461

and I think it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be denied me.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.462

If such a Practice as this be admitted, no Witness is safe in giving
his Testimony against any Conspirators whatsoever.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.463

For, my Lord, I must desire leave to offer another thing to
your Consideration, before I speak to the particular Evidence,
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.464

and that is this; That here is nothing but a bare Point of Time upon
which this Perjury is assigned; when the Substance of the Testimony
that I gave at the Trials of Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> and
the rest, about the Popish Plot, is not assigned as any Perjury at all;
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.465

it is only a Circumstance of Time and Place.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.466

And, my Lord, I shall offer this to your further Consideration, that
<font> Ireland <$$font> was convicted for a treasonable Resolution to
murder the late King, and not for being in Town in <font> August <$$font>
or <font> September <$$font> 78, or elsewhere; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.467

and he was not convicted for his being in his Chamber in <font>
Russel-street <$$font>, and taking his leave there in <font>
August <$$font>, which is one matter of the Perjury now assigned.
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.468

Next, my Lord, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} hard and unreasonable to tie up
Witnesses that come to discover Plots and Conspiracies, to speak
positively as to Circumstance of Time and Place, and every little
Punctilio in their Evidence, to bind them up to such Niceties in the
delivery of their Testimonies, as to Time and Place.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.469

It is usual to speak with latitude as to such kind of things,
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.470

and $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} probably my Evidence which is now in question
, was not that <font> Ireland <$$font> was the 1st or 2d of <font>
September <$$font> positively here in Town; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.471

but, my Lord, I did <paren> I believe <$$paren> give myself a latitude ,
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.472

and would not confine myself to either the 1st or 2d, 5th, 6th, 7th,
or 8th; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.473

But my Lord, that he was in <font> September <$$font> there, I am
positive.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.474

I must therefore beg your Lordship's and the Court's Opinion, whether
that Mr. <font> Foster <$$font> did prove that I was positive and
precise to the Days of the 1st and 2d of <font> September <$$font> 78?
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.475

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> In my Opinion it is
a plain Evidence that you did swear positively to those two Days;
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.476

and you spoke to a Circumstance very material in your Evidence, that
either the first or 2d of <font> September <$$font> you had twenty
shillings of him in Town here: OATES-E3-P2,4.90.477

Now that Circumstance of his Kindness to you, was not a Circumstance of
Time or Place.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.478

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then, my Lord, I shall begin with my Proofs:
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.479

but, my Lord, I desire I may have free Liberty to mind my Business;
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.480

for here is a Gentleman behind me that will not let me be at quiet,
but is either meddling with me or my papers.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.481

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who is it?
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.482

Let me know him, and I will take care to make him quiet, or set him
farther off.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.483

You, Gentlemen, that are at the Bar should know better, one would think:
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.484

He must have liberty to make his own Defence; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.485

and if he complains and lets me know who meddles with him, they had
better do somewhat else.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.486

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, the first thing that I offer , is, that
<font> Ireland <$$font> was convicted of Treason, OATES-E3-P2,4.90.487

and for that you have the Record.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.488

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> It is allowed of all sides
, that <font> Ireland <$$font> was convicted and attainted of Treason.
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.489

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then, my Lord, the principal Defence which,
as near as I can remember, Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> made at
his Trial, was an Endeavour to prove that he was not in Town between
the 8th and 12th of <font> August <$$font>, nor the 1st and 2d Days
of <font> September <$$font>, which are the Points now in Issue;
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.490

and he then produced on Mr. <font> Gifford <$$font>, and his
Sister and Mother; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.491

and fifteen or sixteen Witnesses were produced at Mr. <font>
Whitebread <$$font>'s Trial, of which there is another Record, that
being six Months after Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> was tried:
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.492

There Mr. <font> Whitebread <$$font> produces several Witnesses,
Mr. <font> Gifford <$$font>, I say, and several others, I think ,
to the number of sixteen, which were to prove <font> Ireland <$$font>
's being out of Town in these times that these Witnesses speak of.
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.493

Now, my Lord, all those several Witnesses being produced to prove <font>
Ireland <$$font> then out of Town, the very Point that is now in Issue,
was then so; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.494

and notwithstanding all those Witnesses, the Jurors who tried Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font>, and the Jurors who tried Mr. <font>
Whitebread <$$font> and the other four Jesuits, found them guilty; tho'
they endeavour'd with all their force imaginable to oppose my Testimony
, OATES-E3-P2,4.90.495

and it was left to the Consideration of the Jury what their Witnesses
had said.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.496

If your Lordship pleases to remember, my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs
<$$font> did observe to the Jury, that the Evidence of the Prisoner at
the Bar did consist only in Punctilio's of Time; which, as near as I can
remember what he said, he called a nicety of Time; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.497

and in <font> Whitebread <$$font>'s Trial he was pleased to call it
catching in Point of Time.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.498

And it was observ'd at <font> Ireland <$$font>'s Trial, that his
Defence was so weak, that my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs <$$font>
, upon the Integrity of <font> Bedloe <$$font>'s Evidence and mine,
uses these Words to the Jury <paren> tho'he then endeavour'd to do what
these Witnesses do now <$$paren>: OATES-E3-P2,4.90.499

It is most plain the Plot is discovered, and that by these Men, and that
it is a Plot, and a villainous one.  Which shews not only the Fullness
and Satisfactoriness of our Proof that we gave, but does also take notice
of the little Shifts and catching Tricks he made use of to prove himself
out of Town; which would not weigh with the Court.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.500

Therefore I observe, it is but the same Objection that then was made,
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.501

and is not a new one now.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.502

And my Lord Chief Justice that then was, speaking of that Proof he brought
<paren> which the Court heard with patience, but could easily see through
the Vanity of it, <$$paren> said, What Arts they have of evading this,
I know not; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.503

for as they have turn'd their Learning into Subtilty, so they have their
Religion too.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.504

All this is well remembered by those that were by, and heard that Trial
: OATES-E3-P2,4.90.505

And tho'<font> Ireland <$$font> laboured to disprove me in that
Circumstance of Time, yet still the Court did justify the Evidence
that Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font> and myself had given.
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.506

And the same Chief Justice said, I leave it to you to consider, whether
you have not as much Evidence from these two Men as can be expected in a
Case of this nature?  And whether Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> be not
rather justified by the Testimony offer'd against him, than discredited?
OATES-E3-P2,4.90.507

This was after his Plea was debated and considered: OATES-E3-P2,4.90.508

and I must further observe to your Lordship, that tho'Mr. <font>
Ireland <$$font> by his false Witnesses pressed this matter as far as he
could then, and urged the Court to believe it; yet when the Jury brought
in their Verdict and found him guilty, the Chief Justice expressed the
Satisfaction of the Court in these Words: OATES-E3-P2,4.90.509

You have done, Gentlemen, like very good Subjects and very good
Christians; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.510

that is to say, like very good Protestants: OATES-E3-P2,4.90.511

and now much good may their 30000 Masses do them.  OATES-E3-P2,4.90.512

This, my Lord, was the Case of Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>,
at his Trial; OATES-E3-P2,4.90.513

<P_4.91>

and the same Point of his being out of Town was again managed before a
second Jury at the Trial of the five Jesuits; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.515

but the Court saw the Design of the Popish Party to blemish the Evidence
given of the Plot; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.516

but yet they look'd upon it only as a Trick.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.517

And my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs <$$font>, in summing up the
Evidence at that Trial, says, They fall foul upon Mr. <font>
Oates <$$font>, meaning myself; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.518

he appears to have been their Agent, and whilst so, bad enough.
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.519

But if he had not had a mind to become a good Man, he would not have
done us that good he has done, in the Discovery of the Design they had
engaged him in.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.520

And if your Lordship please to remember, that at that Trial of the five
Jesuits, when all Arts were used to prove <font> Ireland <$$font> out of
Town, and me at <font> St. Omers <$$font>, in the same Charge to
the Jury, my Lord <font> Scroggs <$$font> did take notice that the Jesuits
were very exact at catching in a Point of Time; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.521

but now says, that there is a thing that no Man can precisely charge
his Memory withal; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.522

and therefore he does there persuade the Jury, that that should not be
too strictly the Measure of their Judgments about Truth and Falshood,
by the Mistake of seven or eight Days: OATES-E3-P2,4.91.523

For, said he to the Jury, examine yourselves how often every day you
do mistake things that have been transacted half a Year ago, and err in
Point of Time, taking one Week for another, and one Month for another ;
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.524

and therefore you are not to lay too great a Weight upon the Point
of Time.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.525

Now, if too great Weight, my Lord, be not to be laid upon a point of Time,
then this Charge that is now brought against me is not of weight at all.
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.526

And besides, my Lord, this ought to be considered, if this were the great
Objection then, and then answered, it ceases to be an Objection now.
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.527

And, as the Court did observe at the summing up of the Evidence, that
they made their Defence about the Uncertainty of a Point of Time, which
was no Defence at all; so that, my Lord, the whole Course of my Plea
is this: $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a hard case for a Man, after six Years,
to be indicted for a Circumstance of Time.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.528

I will first offer the Testimony of one Witness that is dead,
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.529

and that is Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font>, who at his Death confirmed
all that he had sworn of the Popish Plot to be true, and affirmed that
he had rather spoken less than the Truth, than more; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.530

and for that I desire that my Lord Keeper may be called, who took his
dying Examination.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.531

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> As for that, Mr.
<font> Oates <$$font>, it is a thing very well known to the World,
and particularly to a worthy Gentleman that sits by you, <bracket>
<font> Pointing to <$$font> Mr. <font> North <$$font> <$$bracket>
that Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font>, when he was sick, did make some
such Protestation.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.532

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then, my Lord, I desire that Mr. <font>
Blaney <$$font> may be sworn, to give an account, what Mr. <font>
Bedloe <$$font> testified at Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font> 's Trial.
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.533

<font> Then Mr. <$$font> Blaney <font> was sworn.  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.534

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Mr. <font> Blaney <$$font>, pray will
you see in your Notes of <font> Ireland <$$font>'s Trial, whether
Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font> did not swear that Mr. <font>
Ireland <$$font> was in Town, the latter end of <font> August <$$font>
78, or the beginning of <font> September?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.91.535

Mr. <font> Blaney.  <$$font> Whereabouts in the Trial is it, Sir?
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.536

<font> Oates.  <$$font> It is in the printed Trial, <font> folio
<$$font> 41.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.537

Mr. <font> Blaney.  <$$font> My Lord, I do find these Words
in my Notes, that Mr. <font> Bedloe <$$font> should say, about
the latter end of <font> August <$$font>, or the beginning of <font>
September <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.91.538

but I believe it was the latter end of <font> August <$$font>, Mr.
<font> Ireland <$$font> was at <font> Harcourt <$$font> 's Chamber,
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.539

and being asked the Question by my Lord Chief Justice <font> Scroggs
<$$font>, Whether he said positively, it was the latter end of
<font> August <$$font>; he said it was in <font> August <$$font>,
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.540

he would not be positive to a Day, OATES-E3-P2,4.91.541

but he thought the latter end.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.542

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis}
very well known too, that <font> Bedloe <$$font> did swear <font>
Ireland <$$font> was in Town the latter end of <font> August <$$font>
, or beginning of <font> September <$$font>; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.543

and to confirm it upon Mr. <font> Ireland <$$font>'s Denial,
you swore he was in Town the 1st or 2d of <font> September <$$font>;
and gave you twenty Shillings, OATES-E3-P2,4.91.544

that was the Occasion of your Oath.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.545

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then, my Lord, I desire to call some Witnesses
to testify to the Deposition that was taken of Mr. <font>
Jennison <$$font>, about <font> Ireland <$$font>'s being then in Town.
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.546

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> When was that Deposition
taken, and before whom?  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.547

<font> Oates.  <$$font> It was taken in the Year 79, by Sir <font>
Edmund Warcup <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.548

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But we $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} admit that in Evidence, unless the King's Counsel will
consent.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.549

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, I will then produce what he swore at
another Trial.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.550

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why, where is he?
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.551

Is he dead?  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.552

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, it has cost a great deal of Money to
search him out; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.553

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} any where meet with him,
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.554

and that makes my Case so much harder that I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
, when I have done all that Man can do to get my Witnesses together.
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.555

I sent in the depth of Winter for him, when I thought my Trial would
have come on before; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.556

but I could never hear of him.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.557

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> We $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
help that.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.558

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Will what he said at any other Trial be Evidence
here?  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.559

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look you, though in
strictness, unless the Party be dead, we do not use to admit of any
such Evidence; yet if you can prove any thing he swore at another Trial,
we will indulge you so far.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.560

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Have you the record of Sir <font> George
Wakeman <$$font>'s Trial there, Sir <font> Samuel Astry?  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.561

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Here it is;
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.562

if Mr. <font> Oates <$$font> have any use for it, we will lend
it to him.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.563

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Put it in;
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.564

and now prove what you can, what <font> Jennison <$$font> swore at
that Trial.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.565

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Mr. <font> Blaney <$$font>, have
you your Notes of Sir <font> George Wakeman <$$font>'s Trial here?
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.566

Mr. <font> Blaney.  <$$font> No, Sir, the Ticket of your <font>
Subpoena <$$font> did only mention <font> Ireland, Whitebread <$$font>
, and <font> Langhorn <$$font>'s Trials.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.567

But I did formerly upon another Occasion look for the Trial of Sir <font>
George Wakeman <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.91.568

but could not find it among all my Notes.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.569

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Sir, can you remember then what <font> Jennison
<$$font> swore at that Trial, about <font> Ireland <$$font> 's being
here in Town?  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.570

Mr. <font> Blaney.  <$$font> Truly, my Lord, I can never trust
my Memory at all when I take Notes; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.571

and it is now so long since that Trial, that I dare not undertake to
say I remember any Particulars of it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.572

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He says it is so long since,
that he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} remember any thing.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.573

But there is Sir <font> Edmund Warcup <$$font> now; OATES-E3-P2,4.91.574

Is he sworn?  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.575

<font> Cryer.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.576

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What do you ask him then?
OATES-E3-P2,4.91.577

<font> Oates.  <$$font> I would desire to examine Sir <font> Edmund
Warcup <$$font>, my Lord, about the Deposition of <font> Jennison <$$font>
that he took.  OATES-E3-P2,4.91.578

<P_4.92>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But we tell you that $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} be admitted as Evidence, without they will consent
to it on the other side.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.580

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, he proves Mr. <font> Ireland
<$$font> here the 19th of <font> August <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.581

and that contradicts these Witnesses.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.582

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> If they will admit it,
well and good; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.583

else we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.584

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> My Lord, we will be so
fair with Mr. <font> Oates <$$font>, if he will admit Mr.
<font> Jennison <$$font>'s Letter, that is under his hand, wherein he
does own that he was mistaken in his whole Evidence about that matter,
we will consent his Deposition to be read.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.585

Mr. Just. <font> Withins.  <$$font> If he will not consent
to that, there's no reason you should consent to the other, Mr.
<font> Attorney <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.586

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look you, Mr. <font>
Oates <$$font>, Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font> makes you this Offer;
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.587

you desire to have Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font>'s Depositions
read, which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be done without their consent;
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.588

they tell you they will consent, if you will let them prove what he has
own'd since about that Business.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.589

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, I will consent with all my heart;
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.590

let them read any Letter under his hand.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.591

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well, do it on both sides
by Consent; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.592

and now, Mr. <font> Oates <$$font>, do you produce his Examination.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.593

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray, Sir <font> Edmund Warcup <$$font>, will
you please to give the Court an Account what Deposition Mr.
<font> Jennison <$$font> made before you, about <font> Ireland <$$font>
's being in Town in <font> August <$$font> 78?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.594

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup.  <$$font> If my Lord commands me, I will.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.595

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay, you must answer his
Question.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.596

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup.  <$$font> This Mr. <font> Jennison
<$$font> did make one Information before me, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.597

and according to the Duty that was incumbent upon me, I deliver'd it to
the King and Council, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.598

and there it has lain ever since; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.599

for me to remember the Particulars of it, is impossible.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.600

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you his Examination
here, Mr. <font> Oates?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.601

If you have, shew it him.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.602

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup.  <$$font> If I see my Hand to it, attesting
it was sworn before me, I can say somewhat to it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.603

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, he says he deliver'd it in to the
Council; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.604

but it is printed.  - OATES-E3-P2,4.92.605

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is no Evidence, Man.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.606

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup.  <$$font> I can say nothing to it, unless I
saw it under my own hand.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.607

<font> Oates.  <$$font> That is impossible for me to have, my Lord.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.608

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
tell how to help it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.609

Sir <font> Edmund Warcup.  <$$font> You have no more to say to me, Sir,
have you?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.610

<font> Oates.  <$$font> No, Sir, I have not.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.611

Pray call <font> Sarah Batten <$$font>.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.612

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> Is that the same that
was <font> Sarah Paine?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.613

<font> Oates.  <$$font> I think so, Sir; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.614

I am not sure it is she, till she come hither.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.615

<font> Cryer.  <$$font> Here is <font> Sarah Batten.  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.616

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray swear her, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.617

and call Sir <font> Thomas Doleman.  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.618

<bracket> <font> Which was done.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.619

But Sir <$$font> Thomas Doleman <font> did not appear.  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.620

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray was not your name <font> Sarah Paine?
<$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.621

<font> Batten.  <$$font> My Lord, I desire my Charges before I speak.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.622

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What is your Name,
good Woman?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.623

<font> Batten.  <$$font> My name is <font> Sarah Batty.  <$$font>
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.624

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Was not your Name <font> Sarah Paine <$$font>
, once?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.625

<font> Batty.  <$$font> No, my Maiden-Name was <font> Sarah Edmunds.
<$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.626

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Was not you a Witness at the Trial of Mr.
<font> Ireland?  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.627

<font> Batty.  <$$font> No, Sir.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.628

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Did not you live with my Lord <font> Arlington?
<$$font> - OATES-E3-P2,4.92.629

<font> Batty.  <$$font> No, Sir.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.630

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then I have been at all this Charge for nothing.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.631

Are you sure your Name was not <font> Sarah Paine?  <$$font> -
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.632

<font> Batty.  <$$font> No, indeed, Sir.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.633

<font> Oates.  <$$font> They told me that she liv'd at <font> Uxbridge
<$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.634

and thither I sent.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.635

<font> Batty.  <$$font> I do live at <font> Uxbridge <$$font>, Sir.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.636

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Upon your Oath, were you a Witness at any of
the other Trials, or not?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.637

<font> Batty.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I was not.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.638

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then I have nothing to say to her.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.639

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What other Witnesses have
you to call?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.640

<font> Oates.  <$$font> We have laboured all we could to find her out,
and searched for her with all the care imaginable; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.641

and here we thought we had had her, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.642

but it seems it is not she.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.643

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> We $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
help it.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.644

<font> Batten.  <$$font> I hope, my Lord, you will consider my Charges
in coming up hither.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.645

<font> Oates.  <$$font> I will take care of thee, Sweet-heart.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.646

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who do you call next?
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.647

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray call Mr. <font> Charles Clare.
<$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.648

<font> Cryer.  <$$font> He is not here.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.649

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray call Mr. <font> Percival <$$font>.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.650

My Lord, I desire Mr. <font> Blaney <$$font> may give an account
what she swore about <font> Ireland <$$font>'s being in Town, seeing I
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} have her here.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.651

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That we $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} do neither, without Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>
will consent: OATES-E3-P2,4.92.652

For this, as well as the other, is an extraordinary thing.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.653

<font> Oates.  <$$font> You see by my bringing this Witness, my Lord,
that I have done what I could to find her out.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.654

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What say you, Mr.
<font> Attorney <$$font>, OATES-E3-P2,4.92.655

will you consent?  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.656

Mr. <font> At. Gen. <$$font> No, my Lord,
it is so irregular, that we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} consent to it.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.657

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray call Mr. <font> Percival <$$font>
and Mr. <font> Vaughan.  <$$font> OATES-E3-P2,4.92.658

<font> Cryer.  <$$font> They do neither of them appear.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.659

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Then I must lose the benefit of her Testimony.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.660

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Have you done?
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.661

<font> Oates.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I will have done immediately.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.662

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Take your own Time.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.663

<font> Oates.  <$$font> I desire Sir <font> Michael Wharton <$$font>
may be call'd.  - OATES-E3-P2,4.92.664

<font> Cryer.  <$$font> He is not here.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.665

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray call Mr. <font> Charles Chetwind.
- OATES-E3-P2,4.92.666

Cryer.  <$$font> He is not here.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.667

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray call Mr. <font> Robert Bowes.  -
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.668

Cryer.  <$$font> He is not here.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.669

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Pray call Mr. <font> John Savile.  <$$font>
- OATES-E3-P2,4.92.670

<font> Cryer.  <$$font> He is not here.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.671

<font> Oates.  <$$font> My Lord, I have served all these with <font>
$Subpoena's <$$font> {COM:font_change_before_apostrophe_in_original}
; OATES-E3-P2,4.92.672

and if they will not come, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help it.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.673

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor we neither.
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.674

<font> Oates.  <$$font> Mr. <font> Jennison <$$font> was used
as a Witness in the Trial of Sir <font> George Wakeman <$$font>,
OATES-E3-P2,4.92.675

and so was Mr. <font> Bowes <$$font>, and Mr. <font> Burnet
<$$font>, who was produced to prove the Circumstance of Mr. <font>
Jennison <$$font>'s Evidence: OATES-E3-P2,4.92.676

But, my Lord, since I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} have the benefit of his
Evidence, nor of <font> Sarah Paine <$$font>'s, I must only sum up all
I have to say in two or three Words.  OATES-E3-P2,4.92.677
