How Monford arrived in England, and of the cold Entertainment he found
amongst his Relations; how he came to Bednal-Green, and settling himself
there, he continud to Begg for his Living, etc. PENNY-E3-P2,141.6

<$$heading>

Monford escaping a Storm at Sea, in his Return Landed with his Vertuous
Wife on the Coast of Essex, where he had some considerable Relations
, to whom in this necessity they applyed themselves for succour,
PENNY-E3-P2,141.8

but they either not desirous of his Company, who after the death of his
Parents had wasted much of his Patrimony, or fearing in that condition
he might be chargeable to them, would not know him, PENNY-E3-P2,141.9

and those that were convinced he was the same Monford that went over
into France, gave him but cold Entertainment, insomuch that scorning to
rely upon their Charity, he told the kind Partner of his joy and sorrow,
that he intended early in the morning to hast towards London, and that he
would rather trust to Providence then to the ingratitude of those who in
his prosperous days had Carressed him in a high manner; PENNY-E3-P2,141.10

and so without taking Leave of any, Early in the morning they departed ;
PENNY-E3-P2,141.11

and in two days travelling <paren> having spent the little Money they
had reserved <$$paren> necessity that has no Law, so far humbled his
high Spirit, that he did not think it amiss <paren> especially in places
where he was not known <$$paren> to crave the Charity of the People as he
passed through several good Towns, who understanding that he came by his
misfortune in fighting for the Honour of his Country, gave very Liberally
, insomuch that he resolved to be of good chear, PENNY-E3-P2,141.12

and thereupon considering with himself that he was never brought up
to Labour, or if he had, <P_142> the Loss of his Sight had rendred him
incapable of business, he resolved to embrace what Providence had cast
in his way: Which was, to live upon Charity, which he found to flow in
upon him faster then he expected: Whereupon arriving at Bednal-Green ,
a place near London, he with the little Money he had got, hired a small
Cottage for his Wife and himself, PENNY-E3-P2,142.13

and daily appearing publick to crave Alms, was from thence called the
Beggar of Bednal-Green, PENNY-E3-P2,142.14

and in a short time found it a thriveing Trade, insomuch that his Bed of
Straw was changed into Down, and his Earthen Platters and other Utensils
into a better Sort.  PENNY-E3-P2,142.15

His Wife whilst he begged abroad not being idle at home, but Laboured at
the Wheel and such other matters as in her younger years she had learned.

CHAP. III PENNY-E3-P2,142.18

How Monford happened to meet with Snap an Old Experienced Beggar, who
gave him an insight into the mistery of the canting Tribe, and how he
invited him to their general Randesvouze, etc. PENNY-E3-P2,142.19

<$$heading>

Monford resolving in this kind of way to spend the remainder of his Days,
that he might humble himself for his former offences, having plyed it
with good success in the place where he lived, by the Road side he was
incountred one day by an Old Proficient at that Trade, who seeing him
Diligent, became greatly desirous of his acquaintance, and to know what
Gang he belonged to, PENNY-E3-P2,142.21

and began to Cant <paren> as is usual amongst such seasoned Sticks of
that Profession <$$paren> of which kind of Speech being known to none
but themselves, PENNY-E3-P2,142.22

Monford being ignorant, could make him no direct answer; which the other
, whose Name was Snap, perceiving, and thereby knowing him to be a young
beginner, invited him to their Feasts or rendesvouze in White-Chappel ,
whither he having promised to come, and they between them tip'd off four
Black Pots of Hum they at that time parted.  PENNY-E3-P2,142.23

How Monford went to the Beggars Feast, and of his Entertainment as also
of the Present they made him, etc. PENNY-E3-P2,143.27

<$$heading>

Monford upon his coming home, declared to his Wife what a merry Companion
he had met with, and what discourse they had, as likewise what he had
promised, entreating her to get things in a readiness, that she might
be at leasure to conduct him thither, where appeared, instead of a
ragged Regiment of Lame, Blind, and Dumb, there was a rout of jovial
Dancers, as gay as the Spring, and as merry as the Maids; which made
them imagine they were either mistaken in the place, or had been imposed
upon PENNY-E3-P2,143.29

and therefore were about to retire, had not Snap who knew Monford at
first Blush, started from his Chair where he sat Supervizor in all
his Gallantry, and taking him by the hand, let him know who he was,
and afterward presented him to the whole Assembly, who received him as
a Brother or Member of their Society, each <paren> by the order of Snap
<$$paren> paying him a Complement: PENNY-E3-P2,143.30

and that for the future he might not want a Guide on all occasion, Snap
in the name of the rest presented him with a Dog and a Bell trained to
the Business, PENNY-E3-P2,143.31

and had before been the Companion of an Eyeless Beggar deceased;
PENNY-E3-P2,143.32

and so having Feasted him and his Spouse in a Splendid manner, they
dismissed him, upon his promise that he would not be wanting at that
yearly meeting; PENNY-E3-P2,143.33

and being dismissed, he trudged home with his tractable Guide, which
ever after proved serviceable to him....  PENNY-E3-P2,143.34

There was an old man that could not well see, who had a fair young Wife
, PENNY-E3-P2,162.41

and with them dwelt a young man, which had long wooed his Mistris to
have his pleasure of her, who at last consented to him, PENNY-E3-P2,162.42

but they knew not how to bring it to pass, PENNY-E3-P2,162.43

for she did never go abroad, but in her husbands company,
PENNY-E3-P2,162.44

and lead him alwaies.  PENNY-E3-P2,162.45

At last she deviled a very fine shift, PENNY-E3-P2,162.46

and bid her servant that he should that night about midnight come into
her chamber where her Husband and she lay, PENNY-E3-P2,162.47

& she would find some device for him.  PENNY-E3-P2,162.48

Night came, PENNY-E3-P2,162.49

and the old man and wife went to bed, PENNY-E3-P2,162.50

but she slept not a wink, PENNY-E3-P2,162.51

but thought still upon her pretended purpose, PENNY-E3-P2,162.52

but a little before the time prefixed, she awakened her Husband,
PENNY-E3-P2,162.53

& said thus unto him: Sir, I will tell you a thing in secret, which your
servant was purposed to do; PENNY-E3-P2,162.54

when I am alone I can never be quiet for him, PENNY-E3-P2,162.55

but he is always inticing me to have me at his will, PENNY-E3-P2,162.56

and so at the last to be quiet with him, I consented to meet him in the
Garden, PENNY-E3-P2,162.57

but for mine Honesties sake I will not.  Wherefore I pray you put on my
clothes and go meet him: PENNY-E3-P2,162.58

so when he comes to you, beat him well, PENNY-E3-P2,162.59

and chide him, PENNY-E3-P2,162.60

for I know well he will not strike you, because you are his Master,
PENNY-E3-P2,162.61

and then he may amend himself & prove a good servant: PENNY-E3-P2,162.62

& the man was well pleased therewith.  PENNY-E3-P2,162.63

So the good man put on his wives Cloaths, PENNY-E3-P2,162.64

and took a good Cudgel in his hand, PENNY-E3-P2,162.65

& went into the garden.  PENNY-E3-P2,162.66

At length there came the servant to his mistris, where she lay in bed,
PENNY-E3-P2,162.67

and did what he would with her, PENNY-E3-P2,162.68

and she was content, PENNY-E3-P2,162.69

& then she told him how she had sent her Husband into the garden in her
apparel, & wherefore, and to what purpose.  PENNY-E3-P2,162.70

So her servant arose, PENNY-E3-P2,162.71

and as she bade him, took a good staff with him, PENNY-E3-P2,162.72

and went into the garden, as though he knew not it was his master,
PENNY-E3-P2,162.73

& said unto him: Nay you whore, I did this but only to <P_163> prove
thee whether thou wouldest be false to my good master, and not that I
would do such a vile thing with thee: whereupon he fell upon his Master,
giving him many sore stripes, & beating him most cruelly, still calling
him nothing but, out you Whore, PENNY-E3-P2,163.74

will you offer this abuse to my good Master: PENNY-E3-P2,163.75

Alas, <paren> qd. his Master <$$paren> good John, I am thy Master,
PENNY-E3-P2,163.76

strike me nomore I pray thee.  PENNY-E3-P2,163.77

Nay whore <paren> qd. he <$$paren> I know who thou are well enough
, PENNY-E3-P2,163.78

& so he strook him again, beating him most grievously.  PENNY-E3-P2,163.79

Good John <paren> said his Master <$$paren> feel, PENNY-E3-P2,163.80

I have a Beard, PENNY-E3-P2,163.81

Then the servant felt <paren> knowing well who it was <$$paren> who
presently kneeled down and cryed his Master mercy.  PENNY-E3-P2,163.82

Now thanks be to God <paren> qd. his Master <$$paren>
PENNY-E3-P2,163.83

I have as good a servant of thee as a man can have, PENNY-E3-P2,163.84

and I have as good a Wife as the World affords.  PENNY-E3-P2,163.85

Afterwards the Master went to bed, & his servant also.  PENNY-E3-P2,163.86

When the old man came to bed to his wife; she demanded of him how he
sped: PENNY-E3-P2,163.87

He answered PENNY-E3-P2,163.88

and said, By my troth Wife, I have the trustiest servant in the world,
& as faithful a Wife; PENNY-E3-P2,163.89

for my Servant came thither with a great staff PENNY-E3-P2,163.90

& did beat me right sore, thinking it had been you, wherefore I was well
pleased therewith.  PENNY-E3-P2,163.91

But ever after the Servant was well beloved of his Master, but better
of his Mistris: PENNY-E3-P2,163.92

for his Master had no mistrust of him, though he had made him a Cuckold.
PENNY-E3-P2,163.93

so the poor man was cruelly beaten, and made Summers Bird nevertheless ...

There was a Priest in the Country which had christened a Child,
PENNY-E3-P2,163.98

and when he had christened it, he & the Clerk were biden to the drinking
that should be there, PENNY-E3-P2,163.99

and thither they went with other people, PENNY-E3-P2,163.100

and being there, the Priest drank PENNY-E3-P2,163.101

and made so merry, that he was quite foxed, and thought to go home before
he laid him down to sleep; PENNY-E3-P2,163.102

but having gone a little way, he grew so <P_164> drowsie, that he could
go no further, but laid him down by a ditch-side so that his feet did
hang in the water, PENNY-E3-P2,164.103

& lying on his back, the Moon shined in his face: PENNY-E3-P2,164.104

thus he lay till the rest of the company came from drinking, who as they
came home found the Priest lying as aforesaid, PENNY-E3-P2,164.105

and they thought to get him away, PENNY-E3-P2,164.106

but do what they could he would no rise, PENNY-E3-P2,164.107

but said, Do no meddle with me, PENNY-E3-P2,164.108

for I lye very well, PENNY-E3-P2,164.109

and will not stir hence before the morning, PENNY-E3-P2,164.110

but I pray lay some more clothes on my feet, PENNY-E3-P2,164.111

and when he came home, he caused his Wife to give him a large new Sheet

and set it on the Plough like a Sail, thinking the Plough would go with

...  Sir Humphrys Journey up to London; And his putting a Trick upon
his Brother; And how he got himself reconciled again to his Father.
PENNY-E3-P2,165.128

<$$heading>

Sir Humphry having now raised his Fortune to so high a pitch in so short
a time, was inclined to let himself loose to his accustomed Pleasures;
PENNY-E3-P2,165.130

and having heard much of the Fame of London, he had a longing desire to
see that place, PENNY-E3-P2,165.131

and to satisfie his Curiosity, he takes his Journey that way,
PENNY-E3-P2,165.132

and having eased himself of the burthen of Necessity, he resolved to
travel like a Gentleman, and lay aside all his Politick Contrivances
, till Poverty should oblige him to make use of them again:
PENNY-E3-P2,165.133

so up to the City of London he came, well mounted, and his Pockets lined
with the best of Coyn; PENNY-E3-P2,165.134

his Journey was very prosperous and pleasant, not meeting with any
interruption in all his passage, in which he found a great deal of
satisfaction: PENNY-E3-P2,165.135

When he had reach'd London, that Famous City, in which his desire was
lodged, he was mightily pleased with the Noble Fabricks and the many
Grandeurs he had not before seen; PENNY-E3-P2,165.136

and when he had taken up his Lodging and provided himself all things
necessary to his Settlement, he walks about, PENNY-E3-P2,165.137

and makes what enquiry he could after some that been formerly
his Acquaintance at Oxford, that they might introduce him into a
farther knowledge of the Town, to which he was a perfect stranger:
PENNY-E3-P2,165.138

He had not made this his business long, but Fortune so favoured him,
that he met one by meer accident, who had been his intimate Friend and
Acquaintance, who were both mightily surprized, and extremely glad to
see each other; PENNY-E3-P2,165.139

and after a kind salutation on both sides, they consented to carrouse
one hearty Bottle to their happy meeting, and to laugh at old passages,
in which they had been both concerned; PENNY-E3-P2,165.140

and in their discourse Sir Humphrys Friend happened <P_165> to inform,
that his Father and his Brother was in Town, and that he had seen them
not above two days ago; PENNY-E3-P2,165.141

Sir Humphry replyed, he was very glad to hear it; PENNY-E3-P2,165.142

and being both intimate together, and sufficiently assured of one anothers
friendship, said, that he would lay hold of the first opportunity he
could, to make himself amends for the Injury his Brother had done him,
in being an Instrument in putting his Father and him at variance;
PENNY-E3-P2,165.143

and enquired of his Friend where it was he lodg'd, who gave him an account
of every matter requisite for Sir Humphrys purpose; PENNY-E3-P2,165.144

and when they had laughed and chatted three or four hours, it began to
grow late, PENNY-E3-P2,165.145

and the Wine had almost turned their Noddles top-side turvey,
PENNY-E3-P2,165.146

they thought it time to part, and to retire home to their respective
Habitations; PENNY-E3-P2,165.147

so they pay'd their Reckoning, PENNY-E3-P2,165.148

and Sir Humphry desired his friend not to take notice to his Father of
his being in Town, who assured he would not; PENNY-E3-P2,165.149

and when they had appointed where to meet the next time, they took a
kind leave of one another, PENNY-E3-P2,165.150

and so parted.  PENNY-E3-P2,165.151

And as Sir Humphry <paren> in his Cups being a little more Frollicksome
than ordinary <$$paren> happened to ramble some way by a House that
was new building, where he heard something rustle in the dark Cellar,
PENNY-E3-P2,165.152

and resolved to see what it was, steps in, PENNY-E3-P2,165.153

and asks, $Who $'s {TEXT:Who's} there?  PENNY-E3-P2,165.154

It happened to be a poor Beggar-wench, about Eighteen years of Age, who
replyed, Nothing <paren> Sir <$$paren> but a poor Girl, who is forc'd
to lye here, for want of a better habitation.  PENNY-E3-P2,165.155

Sir Humphry steps in PENNY-E3-P2,165.156

and swore he would bear her company a little, before he went any further
, PENNY-E3-P2,165.157

and catched hold of the wench, PENNY-E3-P2,165.158

and fell a tumbling and touzing her, PENNY-E3-P2,165.159

and askt her how she could make shift to lye in so cold a dwelling;
PENNY-E3-P2,165.160

she told him, she had made her a Bed of Shavings in the next Cellar,
which was warmer; PENNY-E3-P2,165.161

and Sir Humphry being desirous to see it, entreated the Wench to conduct
him into her Bed-Chamber, which according to his request she did,
PENNY-E3-P2,165.162

and down she and Sir Humphry lay together, who began to be very brisk
with her, PENNY-E3-P2,165.163

and she being loth to deny him the Civility of a Female Bed-fellow,
but receiv'd his close embraces as a courteous obligation.  When the
heat of Pastime began to be over, and Sir Humphry considering what he
had <P_167> done, resolved to contrive a way to lay this Action as a
Scandal upon his Brother.  PENNY-E3-P2,167.164

By this time the Wench began to lay open her unfortunate Condition, and
to desire some Charity from Sir Humphry, for her Relief, which Request
put him in mind of the Outlandish piece of money he had privately taken
from his Brother, who never knew which way he had lost it, thinking
That would be a good Instrument to make his Father really believe his
Brother to be guilty of the thing which he designed to put upon him,
which was the chief hopes of Sir Humphry, who told her, he had spent
that day what money he had brought out with him, and had {TEXT:had_and}
nothing left but an Outlandish piece of money, PENNY-E3-P2,167.165

and that he gave her, PENNY-E3-P2,167.166

and bid her come tomorrow to his Lodging, directing her to the place
where his Father and Brother lay, PENNY-E3-P2,167.167

and goes himself by his Brothers Name, PENNY-E3-P2,167.168

and bids her ask for him, PENNY-E3-P2,167.169

and bid her send up that piece of money, as a Token, by any of the
Servants, PENNY-E3-P2,167.170

and then he should know her business, PENNY-E3-P2,167.171

and would send her down half a Piece; PENNY-E3-P2,167.172

the Wench was mighty thankful, PENNY-E3-P2,167.173

and said, she would be sure to come: PENNY-E3-P2,167.174

so Sir Humphry took his leave, PENNY-E3-P2,167.175

and left her where he found her, PENNY-E3-P2,167.176

and went home to Bed, hoping this design would work.  PENNY-E3-P2,167.177

The next day the Wench, according to his order, went to the place he had
directed her, expecting it to be Sir Humphrys Lodging, where she knocks,
and asks for Sir Humphry's Brother, expecting him to be the same man
she had before seen; PENNY-E3-P2,167.178

the Father being in the Entry, wondring what such a draggle-tail'd wench
would have with his Son, goes to her, PENNY-E3-P2,167.179

and enquires her business; PENNY-E3-P2,167.180

the wench gives him the Token, PENNY-E3-P2,167.181

and desires him to give the Gentleman that, PENNY-E3-P2,167.182

and he would presently know her business: PENNY-E3-P2,167.183

The Father knowing the piece of Coyn to be his Sons, that was given him
as a Token by his Grandmother, wondered the more how such a Wench came
by it; PENNY-E3-P2,167.184

so he calls the Girl within the Doors, PENNY-E3-P2,167.185

and there began to be mighty inquisitive, PENNY-E3-P2,167.186

and examined her strictly how she came by that piece of money and what
was the business she came to his Son about, PENNY-E3-P2,167.187

and threatned the Girl with hard words into so many fears, that at last
she told him the whole <P_168> circumstance of the matter; which put the
Old Man into such a lamentable fury, that he coughed himself half dead
with meer passion; his Son being not within all this time to vindicate
himself before the wenches Face, who got away as soon as she could,
and was glad to escape the old Gentlemans Rage.  PENNY-E3-P2,168.188

In this Agony of vexation the Old Man continued, exclaiming against
his Son for a Reprobate-Rascal, who poor Gentleman, knew nothing of the
matter; PENNY-E3-P2,168.189

at last home he came, where he no sooner entred, but the old man met
him with a lusty Cudgel, and fell to belabouring {COM:picture_omitted}
<P_169> him with all the Vigour that fumbling old Age could lay upon
him , crying out, Thou Villain, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'le} teach you to have
your draggle-tail'd Sluts come after you for Money, PENNY-E3-P2,169.190

and you must give them Tokens, with a Pox to you; PENNY-E3-P2,169.191

and $i $'ll {TEXT:i'le} give you a Token to remember me too before I
part with you.  PENNY-E3-P2,169.192

The Son cryed out for mercy, denying all his Father accused him with,
PENNY-E3-P2,169.193

but nothing could curb the Old mans passion; PENNY-E3-P2,169.194

and when he thought he had bang'd him sufficiently, he turns him out
of doors, not giving him the liberty to speak one word for himself,
PENNY-E3-P2,169.195

and vowed he would never see him no more.  PENNY-E3-P2,169.196

The poor Gentleman thought the Devil was in his Father, to accuse
him with what he knew nothing of, and to beat him so unmercifully,
PENNY-E3-P2,169.197

neither could he imagine what was the meaning of it.  PENNY-E3-P2,169.198

Sir Humphry hearing his design had took so effectually, resolved to
take this opportunity of submitting himself to his Father, which he
accordingly did, PENNY-E3-P2,169.199

and by the endeavour of some Friends, got him throughly reconciled to
him, PENNY-E3-P2,169.200

and was placed again in the same splendid Station he had formerly
lived in, leaving his Brother in the same condition that he himself was
freed from.  PENNY-E3-P2,169.201

Her {COM:meaning_'his',_a_common_parody_of_welsh_speech} being a man
so well to pass in the world, resolved to bring up her son Sheffery
Scolar-like; PENNY-E3-P2,200.213

and in order thereunto put him to the greatest school in those parts ,
where he improved his time so well, that in six or seven Years he was able
to Spell his own Name with a small matter of help.  PENNY-E3-P2,200.214

But not long after, her fond Father supposed her fit for the University
, PENNY-E3-P2,200.215

and disposed of her accordingly; PENNY-E3-P2,200.216

but Jeffry grew negligent, unknown to her Father, PENNY-E3-P2,200.217

and minded more her Waggish Pastimes than her serious Studdy;
PENNY-E3-P2,200.218

and her Father supposing her to be capable to manage a Parsons place,
took a Fatherly care of her, PENNY-E3-P2,200.219

and went to the Bishop of that Diocess, making sute for a Benefice
for her, which was granted, provided that her should preach a Sermon
of Approbation.  PENNY-E3-P2,200.220

Did Shon ap Morgan being joyful of this answer from the Bishop,
writ Post to her Son Sheffry, wishing her with all speed to come,
PENNY-E3-P2,200.221

for her was likely to become a Welsh Parson, and have a Benifice of 40
l. per annum.  PENNY-E3-P2,200.222

These good Tydings so tickled the Ear of our young Parson, that her
omitted no opportunity, PENNY-E3-P2,200.223

but took Horse PENNY-E3-P2,200.224

and rid full speed to her Fathers House in Wales, who told her all the
matter <P_201> in hand; PENNY-E3-P2,201.225

but when her heard that her was to preach before her could have her money,
her knew not what to think on't.  PENNY-E3-P2,201.226

The day appointed drawing nigh when Sheffery was to Preach, being sensible
of her inability, her knew not what course to take, or how her should
perform her Task imposed upon her; PENNY-E3-P2,201.227

sometimes her thought to fly from the presence of the Bishop and her
Father both, PENNY-E3-P2,201.228

and then contradicted that thought with this Resolution, That if he
could not do as well as he should, that he would do as well as he could.
PENNY-E3-P2,201.229

So the day being come, Sheffery lay somewhat long a Bed,
PENNY-E3-P2,201.230

and seemed to have small stomach to his new Concern; which her Father
perceiving, stept up to give her a call, telling her the Saints Bell
had rung in: PENNY-E3-P2,201.231

O Father, said her, I am in a brown Study, PENNY-E3-P2,201.232

look Father upon the top of Mr. Quibus his House,
PENNY-E3-P2,201.233

and behold a Cow-Curd that lyes there; PENNY-E3-P2,201.234

and I have been studying how it might be; whether the top of the House
came down to the Cow, or whether the Cow went up to the top of the House!
PENNY-E3-P2,201.235

O fie Son, this is idle discourse, PENNY-E3-P2,201.236

come make hast, PENNY-E3-P2,201.237

for it draws near ten a Clock, PENNY-E3-P2,201.238

the Bishop and the people begin to think you long.  PENNY-E3-P2,201.239

Well Father I have but a short Sermon to make, PENNY-E3-P2,201.240

but it is such a Tickler as has not been Preached at your Church, since
you came to the Parish, PENNY-E3-P2,201.241

well Son, I shall leave that to your Judgment.  PENNY-E3-P2,201.242

Sheffery no sooner enters the Church, but he steps into the Pulpit;
PENNY-E3-P2,201.243

and begins as followeth.  PENNY-E3-P2,201.244

Good people all, her knows there is something expected from her by way
of Discourse, PENNY-E3-P2,201.245

and seeing we are all met together, take this following matter as an
undeniable Truth.  PENNY-E3-P2,201.246

There are some Things that I know and you know not; PENNY-E3-P2,201.247

and there are some Things that you know, and I know not;
PENNY-E3-P2,201.248

and there are some Things that neither I nor you know.
PENNY-E3-P2,201.249

For thus, As I went over a stile I tore my Breeches, PENNY-E3-P2,201.250

that I know and you know not; PENNY-E3-P2,201.251

but what you will give me towards the mending of them, that you know,
and I know not, PENNY-E3-P2,201.252

but what the Knave the Taylor will have for mending them, that neither
you nor I know.  PENNY-E3-P2,201.253

The Bishop hearing such a strange Welsh discourse <P_202> delivered
as a Sermon, fell into such a laughter, that he laughed himself into
a Looseness, that he was forced to carry his Arse under his Arm ever
after; PENNY-E3-P2,202.254

and Old Shon ap Morgan fell into such a passion, that her solemnly
protested, her would Dis-inherit her Son Sheffery...  PENNY-E3-P2,202.255

CHAP. III.  PENNY-E3-P2,202.257

How Sheffery being weary of London, and short of Money, took a Journey
toward the North; and how he got the good Will of a Sow, which prov'd
the first rise of Sheffery's Fortune.  PENNY-E3-P2,202.258

<$$heading>

Sheffery being forsaken of her Countrymen, & allmost mony-less, wandred
to and fro feasting her Eyes, but starving her Belly, resolved to travel
farther towards the North: PENNY-E3-P2,202.260

her had not gone above 20 miles, but her was surprized by the dismal
night, PENNY-E3-P2,202.261

and being unacquainted with the way, lost her self, PENNY-E3-P2,202.262

and wandred up and down, till at last her hapned upon a small Cottage,
PENNY-E3-P2,202.263

and knocking at the door, her asked how far it might be to the next Town?
PENNY-E3-P2,202.264

the old Man answered: he was far from any Town or House except his:
PENNY-E3-P2,202.265

them {COM:sic} Sheffery craved for Entertainment for that night;
PENNY-E3-P2,202.266

but the old Man reply'd, he had no convenience, PENNY-E3-P2,202.267

but her pressed hard for Lodging; PENNY-E3-P2,202.268

so the old Man said, I have no place for you, except you will lie with
our old Sow, PENNY-E3-P2,202.269

with all her heart, quoth Sheffery.  PENNY-E3-P2,202.270

This being agreed, on they went to their Bed, and Sheffery to the
Hogg-Stye, which joyned to the House, near the old Man and Womans
Beds-head: PENNY-E3-P2,202.271

Sheffery having but a sorry Lodging and a turbulent Bed-fellow, took no
rest at all: PENNY-E3-P2,202.272

the old Man and Woman waking about midnight, fell in discourse,
PENNY-E3-P2,202.273

quoth the old Woman, Husband, what if the young man should fall in
love with our Sow, and forthwith get her good will to be Married?
PENNY-E3-P2,202.274

Who, quoth the old Man, should be against her Preferment, if they like
each other?  PENNY-E3-P2,202.275

Ah!  but Husband, <P_203> she hath been a good Old Servant to us,
PENNY-E3-P2,203.276

and if ever she goes, I hope you will bestow something with her:
PENNY-E3-P2,203.277

Well, well, Wife, I $shall $n't {TEXT:shan't} be backward,
PENNY-E3-P2,203.278

but ten or twenty pound I will bestow if the Man be deserving.
PENNY-E3-P2,203.279

Sheffery minding their Discourse, arose PENNY-E3-P2,203.280

and went into a Carrot field near by, PENNY-E3-P2,203.281

and pull'd some up, PENNY-E3-P2,203.282

and brought them to the Sow, giving her plentifully to eat,
PENNY-E3-P2,203.283

then tyed the rest about his middle, underneath his Coat:
PENNY-E3-P2,203.284

& going into the house to return thanks for his nights Lodging, the Sow
having tasted the sweetness of the Carrots, rav'd as though she would
have torn down the stye, longing for more Carrots, PENNY-E3-P2,203.285

the old Woman hearing the Sow to rave, cry'd out to her Husband, What
is the matter with our Sow?  PENNY-E3-P2,203.286

Quoth Sheffery, her can tell best what is the matter; PENNY-E3-P2,203.287

for her and I have made a match to be Marry'd PENNY-E3-P2,203.288

and now she finding me to be gone without her, causeth her to rave in
this sort?  PENNY-E3-P2,203.289

The old Woman runs with speed to her Husband, PENNY-E3-P2,203.290

and said, Cuts hobby Husband, I told you our Sow is in love with the
Young Man.  PENNY-E3-P2,203.291

Ah!  but quoth her, that must be farther try'd, PENNY-E3-P2,203.292

$i $'ll {TEXT:i'le} see first whether she will follow him sooner than
another; PENNY-E3-P2,203.293

and letting her out, she ran directly at him, and taking hold on him,
as if she loved him above others; PENNY-E3-P2,203.294

the Old Man seeing this, was much satisfied, PENNY-E3-P2,203.295

and call'd Sheffery in, PENNY-E3-P2,203.296

and laid him down 20 pound, wishing them much joy together:
PENNY-E3-P2,203.297

This being done, Sheffery took her leave of the old people
PENNY-E3-P2,203.298

and went her way, PENNY-E3-P2,203.299

by the smell of the Carrots the Sow followed him, which the Old Woman
spying, she cry'd out, Come hither Mistris Bride, PENNY-E3-P2,203.300

pray stay PENNY-E3-P2,203.301

and take my best hat with you, which she did, PENNY-E3-P2,203.302

and look'd like Mother Shipton with her long nose...  PENNY-E3-P2,203.303

Black Tom.  PENNY-E3-P2,209.307

<$$font>

1686 PENNY-E3-P2,209.309

...  CHAP. II.  PENNY-E3-P2,209.310

How this Young Tom came to be known, and how he went by the Name of
Black Tom; and what befell.  PENNY-E3-P2,209.311

<$$heading>

When Tom was grown to be a Man, as lusty and as strong a Thief as
his Father, he told his Father he would now set up for himself;
PENNY-E3-P2,209.313

and when they were both agreed, Tom took his leave in the Evening,
PENNY-E3-P2,209.314

and went for Wapping, where he goes to a House standing nigh to the
Thames: PENNY-E3-P2,209.315

There he enter'd, PENNY-E3-P2,209.316

and call'd for a Pot of Ale; PENNY-E3-P2,209.317

and as he sat drinking his Ale, in the next room were sitting very
merrily over a Bowl of Punch, a Company of jovial Drunken Sea-men,
which Tom observed to make a noise, PENNY-E3-P2,209.318

he also falls to singing as well as they.  PENNY-E3-P2,209.319

The Sea-men observing him to be so merry a Fellow, call'd him in amongst
them; PENNY-E3-P2,209.320

and after he had saluted the Company, and drank a dish of Punch or
two, they ask'd him to sing them a merry Song to pass the time away:
PENNY-E3-P2,209.321

But he cryed no, PENNY-E3-P2,209.322

$let $'s {TEXT:let's} rather drink while we are by land,
PENNY-E3-P2,209.323

for you are always hard employ'd upon the Sea; which Proposal pleas'd
the Sea-men so well, that they oblieg'd themselves to follow Tom's
example; who thereupon began so many Healths one after another, that
the Sea-men not being so fresh as he, by degrees fell fast asleep.
PENNY-E3-P2,209.324

Now Tom minding his opportunity, insensibly creeps to their Pockets,
PENNY-E3-P2,209.325

and takes away all the Money they had, PENNY-E3-P2,209.326

and when he had discharg'd the Reckoning, took his leave of his Hostess
PENNY-E3-P2,209.327

and went off: PENNY-E3-P2,209.328

but the Sea-men waking, and missing their Money, began to curse and
swear at the Black Dog most bitterly; PENNY-E3-P2,209.329

and one of them remembering that his name was Tom, resolved to put him
in the Gazette by the name of Black Tom, PENNY-E3-P2,209.330

but they being almost Drunk, when he came first amongst them, that they
could not remember what sort of <P_210> Cloaths he wore, or whether
his Visage was round or long, or his Body by stature tall or short.
So that one of them coming one day by Charing-Cross, saw a Black behind
a Gentlemans Coach, cryed out very eagerly to the Coach-man to stop his
Horses: PENNY-E3-P2,210.331

and then eagerly running to the Foot-man behind the Coach, lay'd hold
on him, PENNY-E3-P2,210.332

and causing a Constable to be call'd, had the poor Man before a Justice
, PENNY-E3-P2,210.333

and swore against him, That he was the very Man that Rob'd him at such
a time, and such a place; PENNY-E3-P2,210.334

But the Youth making it appear that he was not there, but was employed on
some business for his Lady, was clear'd, and the Man look'd upon as Mad.

CHAP. III.  PENNY-E3-P2,210.337

How Black Tom committed a Robbery at St. Katherines, and how he
came off.  PENNY-E3-P2,210.338

<$$heading>

After Tom and the Sea-men had parted, Tom takes a Boat,
PENNY-E3-P2,210.340

and Rows to St. Katherines, where he lay three days before he
heard of any thing fit for his purpose: PENNY-E3-P2,210.341

At last entring into Discourse with his Landlady, Lord, Landlady, <paren>
says he <$$paren> I admire some People that are Rich, and but few in
Family, are not afraid to stay out of their Houses, especially by Night,
PENNY-E3-P2,210.342

so many loitering idle Fellows as lie here about!  PENNY-E3-P2,210.343

Indeed Sir, says she <$$paren> {COM:no_matching_open_paren} I wonder as
much as you do; PENNY-E3-P2,210.344

but above all People in St. Katherines, I admire at my next
Neighbour, that hath always good store of Plate, and Coin of Gold and
Silver always by her, that she dares lye alone, or with none but a poor
simple Girl, that is her Servant; especially having such a weak Old
House, PENNY-E3-P2,210.345

and by my truly, sometimes they both go out; PENNY-E3-P2,210.346

and one perhaps has got the Key of the Door, PENNY-E3-P2,210.347

and the other coming home, wanting the Key, will lift the Door off the
Hinges: Which hath been done so often, that it comes off now without
any noise.  PENNY-E3-P2,210.348

Indeed Landlady, <paren> says Tom <$$paren> $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} a great
Miracle to me, that they escape so well.  PENNY-E3-P2,210.349

<P_211>

Now Tom being very glad of this News, after a small meditation what to
do, tells his Landlady, That he was invited out, and should be pretty
late before he could come in that Night, PENNY-E3-P2,211.351

and therefore desires her not to sit up late for him, PENNY-E3-P2,211.352

and so departed till toward Night, which time he imployed in viewing
the House, to see how or where he might break in most easily.
PENNY-E3-P2,211.353

At last considering that his Landladys way was the best, he would stay
till Night, and venture at the Door, PENNY-E3-P2,211.354

therefore he goes to an Ale-house hard by, to spend his time.
PENNY-E3-P2,211.355

But not long after the Watch had passed by, crying the time of the Night
, out goes Tom; who coming to the Door, and gently renches it off the
Hinges, goes up the Stairs, and finding every body fast {COM:asleep} ,
opens a Coffer, in which was a Till or Drawer, from whence Tom takes an
Hundred pounds, besides Jewels and Rings; PENNY-E3-P2,211.356

so being very well contented with his prize, was preparing to go off,
PENNY-E3-P2,211.357

but the Watch was passing by, whose custome is to knock at the Doors, and
if they be open, to call upon the People to shut them; PENNY-E3-P2,211.358

but Tom was got withoutside the Door endeavouring to fasten it again.
PENNY-E3-P2,211.359

Now the Watch-men finding the Door off the Hinges, began to think that
Mr. Thomas had committed a fault, PENNY-E3-P2,211.360

and therefore took him into examination.  PENNY-E3-P2,211.361

Now Tom told them that it was his own House, and he had some occasion
to go out, and could not find his Key until he had lifted the Door off
the Hinges; PENNY-E3-P2,211.362

and if they would not believe it was his House, they might come in,
PENNY-E3-P2,211.363

and he would make them drink for their pains.  PENNY-E3-P2,211.364

Now as $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} not the custome of Watch-men to deny drink
at any time, they entered into the House: PENNY-E3-P2,211.365

Now Tom taking down a Mug from the Shelf, and going to the Door, praying
them not to make any noise, under pretension of going to fetch drink,
ran quite away.  PENNY-E3-P2,211.366

Now the Constable having a Drunken Man that was scarce able to go
with him, commanded one of the Watch-men to stay there with him, until
Mr. Black Thomas should come in, PENNY-E3-P2,211.367

and because the poor Man look'd like a Gentleman, should beg Mr.
Black Thomas to lend him a Bed, PENNY-E3-P2,211.368

so the Constable and part of the Watch departed.  PENNY-E3-P2,211.369

Now Mr. Black Thomas not returning, the Gentleman that was o'recome
with drink fell fast asleep, PENNY-E3-P2,211.370

and <P_212> likewise the Watch-man being in the dark, and no body left
to talk to, fell fast asleep also; PENNY-E3-P2,212.371

and slept soundly until the Morning, that the woman of the House finding
her Coffer open, and her Money gone, came happily down, and caused them
to be seized, as Men guilty of Burglary and Robbery, PENNY-E3-P2,212.372

and had them before the Justice, PENNY-E3-P2,212.373

and he had committed them, had not the Constable and Watch come and
cleared them.  PENNY-E3-P2,212.374

Thus Black Tom came off.  PENNY-E3-P2,212.375
