<font> More Directions how to Fish for, and how to make for the <$$font>
Trout <font> an <$$font> Artificial Minnow, <font> and <$$font> Flies,
<font> with some <$$font> Merriment.  WALTON-E3-P2,237.6

<$$heading>

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Well met Brother <font> Peter <$$font>
, WALTON-E3-P2,237.8

I heard you and a friend would lodge here to night, WALTON-E3-P2,237.9

and that hath made me to bring my Friend to lodge here too.
WALTON-E3-P2,237.10

My Friend is one that would fain be <font> a Brother of the Angle <$$font>
, WALTON-E3-P2,237.11

he hath been an <font> Angler <$$font> but this day, WALTON-E3-P2,237.12

and I have taught him how to catch a <font> Chub <$$font> by daping with
a <font> Grasshopper <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,237.13

and the <font> Chub <$$font> he caught was a lusty one of nineteen
inches long.  WALTON-E3-P2,237.14

But pray Brother <font> Peter <$$font> who is your companion?
WALTON-E3-P2,237.15

<font> Peter.  <$$font> Brother <font> Piscator <$$font>, my friend is
an honest <font> Country-man <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,237.16

and his name is <font> Coridon <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,237.17

and he is a downright witty companion that met me here purposely to be
pleasant and eat a <font> Trout <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,237.18

And I have not yet wetted my Line since we met together:
WALTON-E3-P2,237.19

but I hope to fit him with a <font> Trout <$$font> for his breakfast,
WALTON-E3-P2,237.20

for $I $'ll {TEXT:I'le} be early up.  WALTON-E3-P2,237.21

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Nay Brother, you shall not stay so long:
WALTON-E3-P2,237.22

for look you here is a Trout <P_238> will fill six reasonable bellies.
WALTON-E3-P2,238.23

Come Hostess, dress it presently, WALTON-E3-P2,238.24

and get us what other meat the house will afford, WALTON-E3-P2,238.25

and give us some of your best <font> Barly-wine <$$font>, the good
liquor that our honest Fore-fathers did use to drink of; the drink which
preserved their health, and made them live so long, and to do so many
good deeds.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.26

<font> Peter.  <$$font> O'my word this <font> Trout <$$font> is perfect
in season.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.27

Come, I thank you, WALTON-E3-P2,238.28

and here is a hearty draught to you, and to all the brothers of the Angle
wheresoever they be, and to my young brothers good fortune to morrow:
WALTON-E3-P2,238.29

I will furnish him with a Rod, if you will furnish him with the rest of
the Tackling; WALTON-E3-P2,238.30

we will set him up and make him a Fisher.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.31

And I will tell him one thing for his encouragement, that his fortune
hath made him happy to be Scholar to such a Master; a Master that knows
as much both of the nature and breeding of fish as any man: and can
also tell him as well how to catch and cook them, from the <font> Minnow
<$$font> to the <font> Salmon <$$font>, as any that I ever met withall.
WALTON-E3-P2,238.32

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Trust me, brother <font> Peter <$$font> ,
I find my Scholar to be so sutable to my own humour, which is to be free
and pleasant, and civilly merry, that my resolution is to hide nothing
that I know from him.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.33

Believe me, Scholar, this is my resolution; WALTON-E3-P2,238.34

and so $here $'s {TEXT:here's} to you a hearty draught, and to all that
love us, and the honest Art of Angling.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.35

<font> Ven. <$$font> Trust me, good Master, you shall not sow
your seed in barren ground, WALTON-E3-P2,238.36

for I hope to return you an increase answerable to your hopes;
WALTON-E3-P2,238.37

but however you shall find me obedient, and thankful, and serviceable
to my best abilitie.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.38

<font> Pisc. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} enough, honest Scholar
, WALTON-E3-P2,238.39

come $let $'s {TEXT:lets} to supper.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.40

Come my friend <font> Coridon <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,238.41

this <font> Trout <$$font> looks lovely, WALTON-E3-P2,238.42

it was twentie two inches when it was taken, WALTON-E3-P2,238.43

and the belly of it looked some part of it as yellow as a Marigold,
and part of it as white as a lilly, WALTON-E3-P2,238.44

and yet $me $thinks {TEXT:methinks} it looks better in this good sawce.
WALTON-E3-P2,238.45

<font> Cor. <$$font> Indeed honest friend, it looks well,
WALTON-E3-P2,238.46

and tastes well, WALTON-E3-P2,238.47

I thank you for it, WALTON-E3-P2,238.48

and so doth my friend <font> Peter <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,238.49

or else he is to blame.  WALTON-E3-P2,238.50

<font> Pet. <$$font> Yes, and so I do, WALTON-E3-P2,238.51

we all thank you, WALTON-E3-P2,238.52

and when we have <P_239> supt, I will get my friend <font> Coridon
<$$font> to sing you a Song for requital.  WALTON-E3-P2,239.53

<font> Cor. <$$font> I will sing a song, if any body will sing
another; WALTON-E3-P2,239.54

else, to be plain with you, <font> I will sing none <$$font>:
WALTON-E3-P2,239.55

I am none of those that sing for meat, but for company:
WALTON-E3-P2,239.56

I say, <font> $'T $is {TEXT:Tis} merry in Hall, when men sing all.
<$$font> WALTON-E3-P2,239.57

<font> Pisc. <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'l} promise you $I $'ll
{TEXT:I'l} sing a song that was lately made at my request, by Mr.
<font> William Basse <$$font>, one that hath made the choice songs of
the <font> Hunter in his cariere <$$font>, and of <font> Tom of Bedlam
<$$font>, and many others of note; WALTON-E3-P2,239.58

and this that I will sing is in praise of Angling.  WALTON-E3-P2,239.59

<font> Cor. <$$font> And then mine shall be the praise of a
Country mans life: WALTON-E3-P2,239.60

What will the rest sing of?  WALTON-E3-P2,239.61

<font> Pet. <$$font> I will promise you, I will sing another song
in praise of Angling to morrow night, WALTON-E3-P2,239.62

for we will not part till then, but Fish to morrow, and sup together,
and the next day every man leave Fishing, and fall to his businesse.
WALTON-E3-P2,239.63

<font> Venat. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a match,
WALTON-E3-P2,239.64

and I will provide you a Song or a Catch against then too, which shall
give some addition of mirth to the company; WALTON-E3-P2,239.65

for we will be civil and as merry as beggers.  WALTON-E3-P2,239.66

<font> Pisc. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a match my Masters,
WALTON-E3-P2,239.67

$let $'s {TEXT:lets} ev'n say Grace, and turn to the fire, drink the
other cup to wet our whistles, and so sing away all sad thoughts.
WALTON-E3-P2,239.68

Come on my Masters, WALTON-E3-P2,239.69

who begins?  WALTON-E3-P2,239.70

I think it is best to draw cuts, and avoid contention.
WALTON-E3-P2,239.71

<font> Pet. <$$font> It is a match.  WALTON-E3-P2,239.72

Look, the shortest cut falls to <font> Coridon <$$font>.
WALTON-E3-P2,239.73

<font> Cor. <$$font> Well then, I will begin, WALTON-E3-P2,239.74

for I hate contention.  WALTON-E3-P2,239.75

{COM:song_omitted}

<P_241>

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Well sung <font> Coridon <$$font>,
WALTON-E3-P2,241.78

this song was sung with mettle; WALTON-E3-P2,241.79

and it was choicely fitted to the occasion; WALTON-E3-P2,241.80

I shall love you for it as long as I know you; WALTON-E3-P2,241.81

I would you were a brother of the Angle, WALTON-E3-P2,241.82

for a companion that is chearful, and free from swearing and scurrilous
discourse, is worth gold.  WALTON-E3-P2,241.83

I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one
another next morning; nor men <paren> that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} well
bear it <$$paren> to repent the money they spend when they be warmed
with drink: WALTON-E3-P2,241.84

and take this for a rule, WALTON-E3-P2,241.85

You may pick out such times and such companies, that you may
make your selves merrier for a little than a great deal of money;
WALTON-E3-P2,241.86

for <font> $'T $is {TEXT:Tis} the company and not the charge that makes
the feast <$$font>: WALTON-E3-P2,241.87

and such a companion you prove, WALTON-E3-P2,241.88

I thank you for it.  WALTON-E3-P2,241.89

But I will not complement you out of the debt that I owe you,
WALTON-E3-P2,241.90

and therefore I will begin my Song and wish it may be so well liked.
WALTON-E3-P2,241.91

{COM:song_omitted}

<P_243>

<font> Cor. <$$font> Well sung WALTON-E3-P2,243.94

brother, you have paid your debt in good coin, WALTON-E3-P2,243.95

we Anglers are all beholding to the good man that made this Song.
WALTON-E3-P2,243.96

Come Hostess, give us more Ale, WALTON-E3-P2,243.97

and $let $'s {TEXT:lets} drink to him.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.98

And now $let $'s {TEXT:lets} every one go to bed that we may rise early
; WALTON-E3-P2,243.99

but first $let $'s {TEXT:lets} pay our reckoning, WALTON-E3-P2,243.100

for I will have nothing to hinder me in the morning, WALTON-E3-P2,243.101

for my purpose is to prevent the Sun-rising.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.102

<font> Pet. <$$font> A match; WALTON-E3-P2,243.103

Come <font> Coridon <$$font>, you are to be my Bed-fellow:
WALTON-E3-P2,243.104

I know, brother, you and your Scholar will lie together;
WALTON-E3-P2,243.105

but where shall we meet to morrow night?  WALTON-E3-P2,243.106

for my friend <font> Coridon <$$font> and I will go up the water towards
<font> Ware <$$font>.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.107

<font> Pisc. <$$font> And my Scholar and I will go down towards
<font> Waltham <$$font>.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.108

<font> Cor. <$$font> Then $let $'s {TEXT:lets} meet here,
WALTON-E3-P2,243.109

for here are fresh sheets that smell of <font> Lavender <$$font>,
WALTON-E3-P2,243.110

and I am sure we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} expect better meat, or better
usage in any place.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.111

<font> Pet. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a match.
WALTON-E3-P2,243.112

Good night to every body.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.113

<font> Pisc. <$$font> And so say I.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.114

<font> Venat. <$$font> And so say I.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.115

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Good morrow good Hostess, I see my brother
<font> Peter <$$font> is still in bed: WALTON-E3-P2,243.116

Come give my Scholar and me a Morning-drink, and a bit of meat to
breakfast, WALTON-E3-P2,243.117

and be sure to get a good dish of meat or two against supper,
WALTON-E3-P2,243.118

for we shall come home as hungry as Hawks.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.119

Come Scholar, $let $'s {TEXT:lets} be going.  WALTON-E3-P2,243.120

<font> Venat. <$$font> Well now, good Master, as we walk towards
the <P_244> River give me direction, according to your promise, how I
shall fish for a <font> Trout <$$font>.  WALTON-E3-P2,244.121

<font> Pisc. <$$font> My honest Scholar, I will take this very
convenient opportunity to do it.  WALTON-E3-P2,244.122

The Trout is usually caught with a worm or a <font> Minnow <$$font>,
<paren> which some call a <font> Penk <$$font> <$$paren> or with a <font>
flie, viz. <$$font> either a <font> natural <$$font> or an <font>
artificial flie <$$font>: concerning which three I will give you some
observations and directions.  WALTON-E3-P2,244.123

And first for Worms: Of these there be very many sorts;
WALTON-E3-P2,244.124

some breed only in the earth, as the <font> Earth-worm <$$font>
; others of or amongst Plants, as the <font> Dug-worm <$$font>;
WALTON-E3-P2,244.125

and others breed either out of excrements, or in the bodies of living
creatures, as in the horns of Sheep or Deer; or some of dead flesh,
as the <font> Maggot <$$font> or <font> gentle <$$font>, and others.
WALTON-E3-P2,244.126

Now these be most of them particularly good for particular Fishes:
WALTON-E3-P2,244.127

but for the <font> Trout <$$font> the <font> dew-worm <$$font>, <paren>
which some also call the <font> Lob-worm <$$font> <$$paren> and the <font>
Brandling <$$font> are the chief; WALTON-E3-P2,244.128

and especially the first for a great Trout, and the latter for a less.
WALTON-E3-P2,244.129

There be also of <font> Lob-worms <$$font> some called <font>
squirrel-tailes <$$font>, <paren> a worm that has a red head, a streak
down the back and a broad tail <$$paren> which are noted to be the best,
because they are the toughest and most lively, and live longest in the
water: WALTON-E3-P2,244.130

for you are to know, that a dead worm is but a dead bait and like to catch
nothing, compared to a lively, quick, stirring worm: WALTON-E3-P2,244.131

and for a <font> Brandling <$$font>, he is usually found in an old
dunghil, or some very rotten place near to it: but most usually in
Cow-dung, or hogs-dung, rather than horse-dung, which is somewhat too
hot and dry for that worm.  WALTON-E3-P2,244.132

But the best of them are to be found in the bark of the <P_245> Tanners
which they cast up in heaps after they have used it about their leather.
WALTON-E3-P2,245.133

There are also divers other kinds of worms which for colour and shape
alter even as the ground out of which they are got: as the <font>
marsh-worm <$$font>, the <font> tag-tail <$$font>, the <font> flag-worm
<$$font>, the <font> dock-worm <$$font>, the <font> oakworm <$$font> ,
the <font> gilt-tayle <$$font>, the <font> twachel <$$font> or <font>
lob-worm <$$font> <paren> which of all others is the most excellent bait
for a <font> Salmon <$$font> <$$paren> and too many to name, even as many
sorts, as some think there be of several hearbs or shrubs, or of several
kinds of birds in the air; of which I shall say no more, but tell you
, that what worms soever you fish with, are the better for being well
scowred, that is long kept, before they be used; WALTON-E3-P2,245.134

and in case you have not been so provident, then the way to cleanse
and scowr them quickly, is to put them all night in water, if they be
<font> Lob-worms <$$font>, and then put them into your bag with fennel :
WALTON-E3-P2,245.135

but you must not put your Brandlings above an hour in water, and then
put them into fennel for suddain use: WALTON-E3-P2,245.136

but if you have time and purpose to keep them long, then they be best
preserved in an earthen pot with good store of <font> Mosse <$$font>
, which is to be fresh every three or four dayes in Summer, and every
week or eight dayes in Winter: or at least the mosse taken from them
, and clean washed, and wrung betwixt your hands till it be dry,
WALTON-E3-P2,245.137

and then put it to them again.  WALTON-E3-P2,245.138

And when your worms, especially the Brandling, begins to be sick, and
lose of his bigness, then you may recover him, by putting a little milk
or cream <paren> about a spoonful in a day <$$paren> into them by drops
on the mosse; WALTON-E3-P2,245.139

and if there be added to the cream $an {TEXT:as} egge beaten and boiled in
it, then it will both fatten and preserve them long.  WALTON-E3-P2,245.140

And note, that when the <font> knot <$$font>, which is near to the middle
of the <font> brandling <$$font> begins to swell, then he is sick, and,
if he be not well look'd to, is near dying.  WALTON-E3-P2,245.141

And for mosse, you are to note, that there be divers kinds of it, which
I could name to you, WALTON-E3-P2,245.142

but will onely tell you, that that which is likest a <font> Bucks-Horn
<$$font> is the best, except it be soft white moss, <P_246> which grows
on some heaths, and is hard to be found.  WALTON-E3-P2,246.143

And note, that in a very dry time, when you are put to an extremity
for worms, Walnut-tree leaves squeez'd into water, or salt in water,
to make it bitter or salt, and then that water poured on the ground,
where you shall see worms are used to rise in the night, will make them
to appear above ground presently.  WALTON-E3-P2,246.144

And you may take notice some say that <font> Camphire <$$font> put
into your bag with your mosse and worms, gives them a strong and so
tempting a smell, that the fish fare the worse and you the better for it.
WALTON-E3-P2,246.145

And now, I shall shew you how to bait your hook with a worm, so as
shall prevent you from much trouble, and the loss of many a hook too;
WALTON-E3-P2,246.146

when you Fish for a <font> Trout <$$font> with a running line: that is
to say, when you fish for him by hand at the ground, I will direct you in
this as plainly as I can, that you may not mistake.  WALTON-E3-P2,246.147

<font> Suppose it be a big Lob-worm, WALTON-E3-P2,246.148

put your hook into him somewhat above the middle, and out again a little
below the middle: WALTON-E3-P2,246.149

having so done, draw your worm above the arming of your hook,
WALTON-E3-P2,246.150

but note that at the entring of your hook it must not be at the head-end
of the worm, but at the tail-end of him, <paren> that the point of your
hook may come out toward the head-end <$$paren> WALTON-E3-P2,246.151

and having drawn him above the arming of your hook, then put the point
of your hook into the very head of the worm, till it come near to the
place where the point of the hook first came out: WALTON-E3-P2,246.152

and then draw back that part of the worm that was above the shank or
arming of your hook, WALTON-E3-P2,246.153

and so fish with it.  WALTON-E3-P2,246.154

And if you mean to fish with two worms, then put the second on before you
turn back the hooks-head of the first worm; you $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
lose above two or three worms before you attain to what I direct you;
WALTON-E3-P2,246.155

and having attain'd it, you will find it very useful, and thank me for
it: WALTON-E3-P2,246.156

For you will run on the ground without tangling.  <$$font>
WALTON-E3-P2,246.157

Now for the <font> Minnow <$$font> or <font> Penk <$$font>, he is not
easily found and caught till <font> March <$$font>, or in <font> April
<$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,246.158

for then he appears first in the River, Nature having taught him to
shelter and hide himself in the Winter in ditches that be near to the
River, and there both to hide and keep himself warm in the mud or in
the weeds, <P_247> which rot not so soon as in a running River, in which
place if he were in Winter, the distempered Floods that are usually in
that season, would suffer him to take no rest, but carry him head-long
to Mills and Weires to his confusion.  WALTON-E3-P2,247.159

And of these <font> Minnows <$$font>, first you are to know, that the
biggest size is not the best; and next, that the middle size and the
whitest are the best: WALTON-E3-P2,247.160

and then you are to know, that your <font> Minnow <$$font> must be so
put on your hook that it must turn round when $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} drawn
against the stream, WALTON-E3-P2,247.161

and that it may turn nimbly, you must put it on a big-sized hook as I
shall now direct you, which is thus.  WALTON-E3-P2,247.162

Put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gill, WALTON-E3-P2,247.163

then having drawn your hook 2 or 3 inches beyond or through his gill,
put it again into his mouth, and the point and beard out at his taile,
WALTON-E3-P2,247.164

and then tie the hook and his taile about very neatly with a white
thred, which will make it the apter to turn quick in the water:
WALTON-E3-P2,247.165

that done, pull back that part of your line which was slack when you
did put your hook into the <font> Minnow <$$font> the second time:
WALTON-E3-P2,247.166

I say pull that part of your line back so that it shall fasten the head,
so that the body of the <font> Minnow <$$font> shall be almost streight
on your hook; WALTON-E3-P2,247.167

this done, try how it will turn by drawing it cross the water or against
a stream, WALTON-E3-P2,247.168

and if it do not turn nimbly, then turn the tail a little to the right
or left hand, WALTON-E3-P2,247.169

and try again, till it turn quick; WALTON-E3-P2,247.170

for if not, you are in danger to catch nothing; WALTON-E3-P2,247.171

for know, that it is impossible that it should turn too quick:
WALTON-E3-P2,247.172

And you are yet to know, that in case you want a <font> Minnow <$$font>
, then a small <font> Loch <$$font> or a <font> Stickle-bag <$$font>
, or any other small fish that will turn quick will serve as well:
WALTON-E3-P2,247.173

And you are yet to know, that you may salt them, and by that means keep
them ready and fit for use three or four days, or longer, and that of
salt, bay-salt is the best.  WALTON-E3-P2,247.174

And here let me tell you, what many old Anglers know right well, that
at some times, and in some waters a <font> Minnow <$$font> is not to be
got, WALTON-E3-P2,247.175

and therefore let me tell you, I have <paren> which I will shew to you
<$$paren> an <font> artificial Minnow <$$font>, that will catch a Trout
as well as an <font> artificial Flie <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,247.176

and it was made by a handsom Woman that had <P_248> a fine hand, and a
live <font> Minnow <$$font> lying by her: WALTON-E3-P2,248.177

<font> the mould or body of the Minnow was cloth, and wrought upon or
over it thus with a needle: WALTON-E3-P2,248.178

the back of it with very sad French green silk, and paler green silk
towards the belly, shadowed as perfectly as you can imagine, just as
you see a Minnow; WALTON-E3-P2,248.179

the belly was wrought also with a needle, WALTON-E3-P2,248.180

and it was a part of it white silk, and another part of it with silver
thred; WALTON-E3-P2,248.181

the tail and fins were of a quill, which was shaven thin,
WALTON-E3-P2,248.182

the eyes were of two little black beads, WALTON-E3-P2,248.183

and the head was so shadowed, and all of it so curiously wrought, and
so exactly dissembled, that it would beguile any sharpe sighted Trout
in a swift stream.  WALTON-E3-P2,248.184

And this Minnow I will now shew you, <paren> look here it is <$$paren>
and if you like it, lend it you, to have two or three made by it,
WALTON-E3-P2,248.185

for they be easily carryed about an Angler, WALTON-E3-P2,248.186

and be of excellent use; WALTON-E3-P2,248.187

for note, that a large Trout will come as fiercely at a Minnow, as the
highest mettled Hawk doth seize on a Partridg, or a Grey-hound on a Hare.
<$$font> WALTON-E3-P2,248.188

I have been told, that 160 <font> Minnows <$$font> have been found in
a <font> Trouts <$$font> belly; WALTON-E3-P2,248.189

either the <font> Trout <$$font> had devoured so many;
WALTON-E3-P2,248.190

or the Miller that gave it a friend of mine had forced them down his
throat after he had taken him.  WALTON-E3-P2,248.191

Now for <font> Flies <$$font>, which is the third bait wherewith <font>
Trouts <$$font> are usually taken.  You are to know, that there are so
many sorts of Flies as there be of Fruits: WALTON-E3-P2,248.192

I will name you but some of them, as the <font> dun-flie <$$font>,
the <font> stone-flie <$$font>, the <font> red-flie <$$font>, the
<font> moor-flie <$$font>, the <font> tawny-flie <$$font>, the <font>
shell-flie <$$font>, the <font> cloudy <$$font>, or <font> blackish-flie
<$$font>, the <font> flag-flie <$$font>, the <font> vine-flie <$$font>
: WALTON-E3-P2,248.193

there be of <font> flies, Caterpillars <$$font>, and <font> Canker-flies
<$$font>, and <font> Bear-flies <$$font>, and indeed too many either
for me to name or for you to remember: WALTON-E3-P2,248.194

and their breeding is so various and wonderful, that I might easily
amaze my self, and tire you in a relation of them.  WALTON-E3-P2,248.195

And yet I will exercise your promised patience by saying a little of
the <font> Caterpillar <$$font> or the <font> Palmer-flie <$$font>
or <font> worm <$$font>, that by them you may guess what a work it
were in a Discourse but to run over those very many <font> flies, worms
<$$font> and little living creatures with which the Sun and Summer adorn
and beautifie the River banks and Meadows; both for the recreation and
contemplation of us Anglers, pleasures which <paren> I think <$$paren>
I my self enjoy more than any other man that is not of my profession.
WALTON-E3-P2,248.196

<P_249>

<font> Pliny <$$font> holds an opinion, that many have their birth or
being from a dew that in the Spring falls upon the leaves of trees; and
that some kinds of them are from a dew left upon herbs or flowers ; and
others from a dew left upon Coleworts or Cabbages: All which kinds of dews
being thickned and condensed, are by the Suns generative heat most of them
hatch'd, and in three days made living creatures; WALTON-E3-P2,249.198

and these of several shapes and colours; some being hard and tough,
some smooth and soft; WALTON-E3-P2,249.199

some are horned in their head, some in their tail, WALTON-E3-P2,249.200

some have none: WALTON-E3-P2,249.201

some have hair, some none: WALTON-E3-P2,249.202

some have sixteen feet, some less, WALTON-E3-P2,249.203

and some have none, WALTON-E3-P2,249.204

but <paren> as our <font> Topsel <$$font> hath with great diligence
observed <$$paren> those which have none, move upon the earth or upon
broad leaves, their motion being not unlike to the waves of the Sea.
WALTON-E3-P2,249.205

Some of them he also observes to be bred of the Eggs of other Caterpillars
, and that those in their time turn to be <font> Butter-flies <$$font>
: and again, that their Eggs turn the following year to be <font>
Caterpillars <$$font>.  WALTON-E3-P2,249.206

And some affirm, that every plant has his particular flie or Caterpillar ,
which it breeds and feeds.  WALTON-E3-P2,249.207

I have seen, and may therefore affirm it, a green Caterpillar, or worm ,
as big as a small Peascod, which had fourteen legs, eight on the belly ,
four under the neck, and two near the tail.  WALTON-E3-P2,249.208

It was found on a hedge of Privet, WALTON-E3-P2,249.209

and was taken thence, and put into a large Box, WALTON-E3-P2,249.210

and a little branch or two of Privet put to it, on which I saw it feed
as sharply as a dog gnaws a bone: WALTON-E3-P2,249.211

it lived thus five or six daies, WALTON-E3-P2,249.212

and thrived, WALTON-E3-P2,249.213

and changed the colour two or three times, WALTON-E3-P2,249.214

but by some neglect in the keeper of it, it then dyed WALTON-E3-P2,249.215

and did not turn to a flie: WALTON-E3-P2,249.216

but if it had lived, it had doubtless turned to one of those flies that
some call flies of prey, which those that walk by the Rivers may in
Summer, see fasten on smaller flies, and I think make them their food.
WALTON-E3-P2,249.217

And $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} observable, that as there be these <font>
flies of prey <$$font> which be very large, so there be others very
little , created, I think, only to feed them, and bred out of I know
not what; whose life, they say, Nature intended not to exceed an hour,
WALTON-E3-P2,249.218

and yet that life is thus made shorter by other flies, or accident.
WALTON-E3-P2,249.219

<P_250>

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} endless to tell you what the curious searchers
into Natures productions have observed of these Worms and Flies:
WALTON-E3-P2,250.221

But yet I shall tell you what <font> Aldrovandus <$$font>, our <font>
Topsel <$$font>, and others say of the <font> Palmer-worm <$$font> or
<font> Caterpillar <$$font>; That whereas others content themselves to
feed on particular herbs or leaves, <paren> for most think those very
leaves that gave them life and shape, give them a particular feeding
and nourishment, and that upon them they usually abide <$$paren> yet
he observes, that this is called a <font> pilgrim <$$font> or <font>
palmer-worm <$$font>, for his very wandring life and various food; not
contenting himself <paren> as others do <$$paren> with any one certain
place for his abode, nor any certain kind of herb or flower for his
feeding; WALTON-E3-P2,250.222

but will boldly and disorderly wander up and down, and not endure to be
kept to a diet, or fixt to a particular place.  WALTON-E3-P2,250.223

Nay, the very colours of <font> Caterpillars <$$font> are, as one has
observed, very elegant and beautiful: WALTON-E3-P2,250.224

I shall <paren> for a taste of the rest <$$paren> describe one of them,
which I will sometime the next month shew you feeding on a Willow-tree,
WALTON-E3-P2,250.225

and you shall find him punctually to answer this very description: <font>
His lips and mouth somewhat yellow, his eyes black as Jet, his forehead
purple, his feet and hinder parts green, his tail two forked and black
, the whole body stained with a kind of red spots which run along the
neck and shoulder-blade, not unlike the form of Saint <$$font> Andrew's
<font> Cross, or the letter <$$font> X, <font> made thus cross-wise,
and a white line drawn down his back to his tail; all which add much
beauty to his whole body.  <$$font> WALTON-E3-P2,250.226

And it is to me observable, that at a fixed age this <font> Caterpillar
<$$font> gives over to eat, and towards Winter comes to be covered
over with a strange shell or crust called an <font> Aurelia <$$font>
, and so lives a kind of dead life, without eating all the Winter;
WALTON-E3-P2,250.227

and <paren> as others of several kinds turn to be several kinds
of flies and vermin the Spring following <$$paren> so this <font>
Caterpillar <$$font> then turns to be a painted <font> Butter-fly
{COM:no_period_in_text} <$$font> WALTON-E3-P2,250.228

Come, come my Scholar, you see the River stops our morning walk,
WALTON-E3-P2,250.229

and I will also here stop my discourse, only as we sit down under this
<font> Honey-suckle <$$font> hedg, WALTON-E3-P2,250.230

whilst I look a Line to fit the Rod that our brother <font> Peter
<$$font> hath lent you, I shall for a <P_251> little confirmation of
what I have said, repeat the observation of <font> Du Bartas <$$font>
: WALTON-E3-P2,251.231

{COM:verse_omitted}

<font> Venat. <$$font> O my good Master, this morning-walk has
been spent to my great pleasure and wonder: WALTON-E3-P2,251.233

but I pray, when shall I have your direction how to make artificial flies,
like to those that the <font> Trout <$$font> loves best?  and also how
to use them?  WALTON-E3-P2,251.234

<font> Pisc. <$$font> My honest Scholar, it is now past five of
the Clock, WALTON-E3-P2,251.235

we will fish till nine, and then go to breakfast: WALTON-E3-P2,251.236

Go you to yonder <font> Sycamore-tree <$$font>, WALTON-E3-P2,251.237

and hide your Bottle of drink under the hollow root of it;
WALTON-E3-P2,251.238

for about that time, and in that place, we will make a brave breakfast
with a piece of powdered Beef, and a Radish or two that I have in my
Fish-bag; WALTON-E3-P2,251.239

we shall, I warrant you, make a good, honest, wholsome, hungry breakfast,
WALTON-E3-P2,251.240

and I will then <P_252> give you direction for the making and using of
your flies: WALTON-E3-P2,252.241

and in the mean time there is your Rod and Line, WALTON-E3-P2,252.242

and my advice is, that you fish as you see me do, WALTON-E3-P2,252.243

and $let $'s {TEXT:let's} try which can catch the first Fish.
WALTON-E3-P2,252.244

<font> Venat. <$$font> I thank you Master, WALTON-E3-P2,252.245

I will observe and practice your direction as far as I am able.
WALTON-E3-P2,252.246

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Look you Scholar, you see I have hold of
a good Fish: WALTON-E3-P2,252.247

I now see it is a Trout; WALTON-E3-P2,252.248

I pray, put that Net under him, WALTON-E3-P2,252.249

and touch not my line, WALTON-E3-P2,252.250

for if you do, then we break all.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.251

Well done Scholar, WALTON-E3-P2,252.252

I thank you.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.253

Now for another.  Trust me, WALTON-E3-P2,252.254

I have another bite: WALTON-E3-P2,252.255

come Scholar, WALTON-E3-P2,252.256

come WALTON-E3-P2,252.257

lay down your Rod, WALTON-E3-P2,252.258

and help me to land this as you did the other.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.259

So, now we shall be sure to have a good dish of Fish for supper.
WALTON-E3-P2,252.260

<font> Venat. <$$font> I am glad of that; WALTON-E3-P2,252.261

but I have no fortune: WALTON-E3-P2,252.262

sure, Master, yours is a better Rod, and better tackling.
WALTON-E3-P2,252.263

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Nay, then take mine, and I will fish
with yours.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.264

Look you, Scholar, I have another; WALTON-E3-P2,252.265

come, do as you did before.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.266

And now I have a bite at another: WALTON-E3-P2,252.267

Oh me!  he has broke all; WALTON-E3-P2,252.268

there's half a line and a good hook lost.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.269

<font> Venat. <$$font> I and a good <font> Trout <$$font> too.
WALTON-E3-P2,252.270

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Nay, the <font> Trout <$$font> is not lost
, WALTON-E3-P2,252.271

for pray take notice no man can lose what he never had.
WALTON-E3-P2,252.272

<font> Venat. <$$font> Master, I can neither catch with the first
nor second Angle: WALTON-E3-P2,252.273

I have no fortune.  WALTON-E3-P2,252.274

<font> Pisc. <$$font> Look you, Scholar, I have yet another:
WALTON-E3-P2,252.275

and now having caught three brace of Trouts, I will tell you a short
Tale as we walk towards our breakfast: WALTON-E3-P2,252.276

<font> A Scholar <paren> a Preacher I should say <$$paren> that was to
preach to procure the approbation of a Parish, that he might be their
Lecturer, had got from his Fellow-pupil the copy of a Sermon that
was first preached with great commendation by him that composed it;
WALTON-E3-P2,252.277

and though the borrower of it preached it word for word, as it was at
first, yet it was utterly disliked as it was preached by the second to
his Congregation: which the sermon-borrower complained of to the lender
of it, WALTON-E3-P2,252.278

and was thus answered; I lent you indeed my <$$font> Fiddle, <font>
but not <P_253> my <$$font> Fiddlestick; WALTON-E3-P2,253.279

<font> for you are to know, that every one $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
make musick with my words, which are fitted for my own mouth.  <$$font>
WALTON-E3-P2,253.280

And so, my Scholar, you are to know, that as the ill pronunciation or
ill accenting of words in a Sermon spoils it, so the ill carriage of
your line, or not fishing even to a foot in a right place, makes you
lose your labour: WALTON-E3-P2,253.281

and you are to know, that though you have my <font> Fiddle <$$font>,
that is, my very Rod and Tacklings with which you see I catch Fish;
yet you have not my <font> Fiddle-stick <$$font>, that is, you yet have
not skill to know how to carry your hand and line, nor how to guide it
to a right place: WALTON-E3-P2,253.282

and this must be taught you <paren> for you are to remember I told you,
Angling is an Art <$$paren> either by practice, or a long observation,
or both.  WALTON-E3-P2,253.283

But take this for a rule, WALTON-E3-P2,253.284

when you fish for a Trout with a Worm, let your line have so much, and
not more Lead than will fit the stream in which you fish; that is to say
; more in a great troublesom stream than in a smaller that is quieter;
as near as may be, so much as will sink the bait to the bottom, and keep
it still in motion, and not more.  WALTON-E3-P2,253.285

But now $let $'s {TEXT:lets} say Grace and fall to breakfast:
WALTON-E3-P2,253.286

what say you, Scholar, to the providence of an old Angler?
WALTON-E3-P2,253.287

does not this meat taste well?  WALTON-E3-P2,253.288

and was not this place well chosen to eat it?  WALTON-E3-P2,253.289

for this Sycamore-tree will shade us from the Suns heat.
WALTON-E3-P2,253.290

<font> Venat. <$$font> All excellent good, WALTON-E3-P2,253.291

and my stomach excellent good too.  WALTON-E3-P2,253.292

And I now remember and find that true which devout <font> Lessius
<$$font> says, <font> That poor men, and those that fast often, have
much more pleasure in eating than rich men and gluttons, that always
feed before their stomachs are empty of their last meat, and call for
more: WALTON-E3-P2,253.293

for by that means they rob themselves of that pleasure that hunger brings
to poor men.  <$$font> WALTON-E3-P2,253.294

And I do seriously approve of that saying of yours, <font> That you had
rather be a civil, well govern'd, well grounded, temperate, poor Angler,
than a drunken Lord.  <$$font> WALTON-E3-P2,253.295

But I hope there is none such; WALTON-E3-P2,253.296

however I am certain of this, that I have been at many very costly
dinners that have not afforded me half the content that this has done,
for which I thank God and you.  WALTON-E3-P2,253.297

<P_254>

And now good Master, proceed to your promised direction for making and
ordering my Artificial flie.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.299

<font> Pisc. <$$font> My honest Scholar, I will do it,
WALTON-E3-P2,254.300

for it is a debt due unto you by my promise: WALTON-E3-P2,254.301

and because you shall not think your self more engaged to me than indeed
you really are, I will freely give you such directions as were lately
given to me by an ingenuous brother of the Angle, an honest man, and a
most excellent <font> Flie-fisher <$$font>.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.302

You are to note, that there are twelve kinds of Artificial made Flies
to Angle with upon the top of the water WALTON-E3-P2,254.303

<paren> note by the way, that the fittest season of using these is in a
blustering windy day, when the waters are so troubled that the natural
flie $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be seen, or rest upon them <$$paren>.
WALTON-E3-P2,254.304

The first is the <font> dun-flie <$$font> in <font> March <$$font>,
WALTON-E3-P2,254.305

the body is made of <font> dun wool <$$font>, the wings of the Partridges
feathers.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.306

The second is another <font> dun-Flie <$$font>, the body of <font> Black
wool <$$font>, and the wings of the black Drakes feathers, and of the
feathers under his tail.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.307

The third is the <font> stone-flie <$$font> in <font> April <$$font>
, WALTON-E3-P2,254.308

the body is made of <font> black wool <$$font> made yellow under
the wings, and under the tail, and so made with wings of the Drake.
WALTON-E3-P2,254.309

The fourth is the <font> ruddy Flie <$$font> in the beginning of <font>
May <$$font>, the body made of <font> red wool <$$font> wrapt about with
black silk, WALTON-E3-P2,254.310

and the feathers are the wings of the Drake, with the feathres of a
red Capon also, which hang dangling on his sides next to the tail.
WALTON-E3-P2,254.311

The fifth is the <font> yellow <$$font> or <font> greenish-flie <$$font>
<paren> in <font> May <$$font> likewise <$$paren> the body made of <font>
yellow wool <$$font>, and the wings made of the red cocks hackle or tail.
WALTON-E3-P2,254.312

The sixth is, the <font> black Flie <$$font> in <font> May <$$font>
also, the body made of <font> black wool <$$font> and lapt about with
the herl of a Peacocks tail; WALTON-E3-P2,254.313

the wings are made of the wings of a brown Capon with his blew feathers
in his head.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.314

The seventh is the sad <font> yellow-flie <$$font> in <font> June <$$font>
, WALTON-E3-P2,254.315

the body is made of <font> black wool <$$font>, with a yellow list on
either side, and the wings taken off the wings of a Buzzard, bound with
black braked hemp.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.316

The eighth is the <font> moorish flie <$$font> made of the blackish mail
of the Drake.  WALTON-E3-P2,254.317

The ninth is the <font> tawny-flie <$$font>, good until the middle of
<font> June <$$font>; the body made of <font> tawny-wool <$$font> , the
wings made contrary one against the other, made of the whitish mail of
the wild <P_255> Drake.  WALTON-E3-P2,255.318

The tenth is the <font> Wasp-flie <$$font> in <font> July <$$font>,
the body made of <font> black wool <$$font>, lapt about with yellow
silk, the wings made of the feathers of the Drake, or of the Buzzard.
WALTON-E3-P2,255.319

The Eleventh is the <font> shell-flie <$$font>, good in mid <font> July
<$$font>, the body made of greenish wool, lapt about with the herle
of a Peacocks tail; and the wings made of the wings of the Buzzard.
WALTON-E3-P2,255.320

The twelfth is the dark <font> Drake-flie <$$font>, good in <font>
August <$$font>, the body made with <font> black Wool <$$font>, lapt
about with black silk: WALTON-E3-P2,255.321

his wings are made with the mail of the black Drake, with a black head.
WALTON-E3-P2,255.322

Thus have you a Jury of flies likely to betray and condemn all the Trouts
in the River.  WALTON-E3-P2,255.323
