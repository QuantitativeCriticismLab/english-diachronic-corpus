<P_28>

This countrey beareth towards the Northwest, in the height of 28.
Degrees, or thereabouts: COVERTE-E2-P2,28.2

And heere Muskets, Snaphances, Pistols, Petronels, and Swords, be good
commodities, but no Firelocks in any wise.  COVERTE-E2-P2,28.3

Also cloth is an excellent commodity to my knowledge, COVERTE-E2-P2,28.4

for I was offered three pound for an old cloake, which heere, is not
worth 20. shillings the vttermost.  COVERTE-E2-P2,28.5

And in Bramport we staied from the seuenth of October vntill the 11 of
Nouember following: COVERTE-E2-P2,28.6

Then I and <font> Iohn Frencham <$$font> of our Company went to
craue the Generals passe, to goe to the great <font> Mogol <$$font>,
COVERTE-E2-P2,28.7

but he asked vs if we would serue him in his warres, COVERTE-E2-P2,28.8

and he would giue vs what meanes we would desire: COVERTE-E2-P2,28.9

but we told him, we were poore distressed Merchants, that had beene
shipwracked: COVERTE-E2-P2,28.10

and hee again replied, that there was no Englishman, Merchant, nor other
but he was a Souldier.  COVERTE-E2-P2,28.11

But we told him that we had wiues and children in our Countrey, to whom
wee must of necessity goe, to which hee said, it was very well spoken,
and that it was against their Lawes to <P_29> keepe any man against his
will: COVERTE-E2-P2,29.12

Then hee asked vs if wee had any Jewels for his Ladies,
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.13

I answered I had one stone and one Jewell, which I sold him for forty
pound sterling, COVERTE-E2-P2,29.14

and then hee commanded his Secretary to make vs a Passe, and seale it
with his great Seale, for our safe conduct to <font> Agra <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.15

Also for the nature & strength of the Elephant, I can say thus much of
mine owne knowledge because I saw it.  COVERTE-E2-P2,29.16

An Elephant royall being brought to remoue a piece of Ordinance of one
and twenty foot long, which caried a shot of seuen inches high, and
lay vpon the cariage on the side of a hill, and to carry the same some
halfe furlong off; which he did as it seemed to the great dislike of his
Keeper, who told him he was a lazy villaine, and deserued not his meat.
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.17

Now the nature of the Elephant is, not to be disparaged in any thing,
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.18

and standeth much vpon his reputation and valour: so that vpon these
speeches of his Keeper, he came to it againe, COVERTE-E2-P2,29.19

and with maine strength tore the carriage in pieces, COVERTE-E2-P2,29.20

and left the piece lying on the ground.  COVERTE-E2-P2,29.21

Then were Carpenters set on worke to make a new carriage, which being
done, the same Elephant was broght, who clapt his Trunke about the
wheeles, and brought the Ordinance where his Keeper commanded him.
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.22

This Citie is farre bigger then <font> London <$$font>,
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.23

and great trade of all sorts of merchandise therin: COVERTE-E2-P2,29.24

it is one of the most famous heathen Cities that euer I came in,
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.25

and the Citizens are very good and kind people, COVERTE-E2-P2,29.26

and very many Gallants in the Citie.  Also fine riuers, ponds, orchards
, gardens, pleasant walkes, and excellent faire prospect as euer I saw.
COVERTE-E2-P2,29.27

Heere any Gentleman may haue pastime to hunt or hawke: COVERTE-E2-P2,29.28

and if hee will not go farre, he may buy a Deere in the <font> Busar
<$$font> or market for a Doller, being but foure shillings sterling,
and hunt him where and when he will.  COVERTE-E2-P2,29.29

Now in my iudgment, our English cloth of gold <P_30> and siluer, veluets,
broad cloth, bayes, and cottons, would be very vendable, in regard there
are so many Gallants.  COVERTE-E2-P2,30.30

And thus much for the great City of <font> Bramport <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,30.31

The eleuenth of Nouember we took our iourny towards <font> Agroe <$$font>
, I and <font> Ioseph Salebanck <$$font> our Purser, and one <font>
Io. Frencham <$$font>, with one of the Country people for our
guide, taking leaue of our Generall, who was extreame sicke of an Ague,
and no hope of any speedy recouery.  COVERTE-E2-P2,30.32

Also we had thought to haue gone along with a Carrauand of foure
hundred and fifty strong, which were bound for <font> Agro <$$font>
: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.33

but the Captaine told vs, that they were to stay seuen daies longer;
COVERTE-E2-P2,30.34

but said, if wee would trauel some two daies iourny <paren> which we
might safely doe without any danger of theeues <$$paren> we should meet
with a greater Carauand then they were.  COVERTE-E2-P2,30.35

So on the twelfth day, wee trauelled to a Towne called <font> Caddor
<$$font>, some fifteene course from thence, where we lay that night.
COVERTE-E2-P2,30.36

Heere the Gouernor hearing that wee were strangers, or Christians ,
demanded what we would haue, and whether we trauelled: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.37

We answered, to <font> Agro <$$font>, to the King, and that we came from
<font> Surrot <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,30.38

Then he asked vs what we would doe with the King: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.39

And when I heard him so inquisitiue, I peremptorily answered, that my
businesse was too great for him to know: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.40

but he said, he would know it ere we went out of the Towne:
COVERTE-E2-P2,30.41

and I againe replied, that my businesse was such, that I would goe out
of the Towne and aske him no leaue: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.42

and so making vs ready to depart, we said, we would see who would stay
vs, without a very lawfull occasion: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.43

Then the Gouernor sent his Cotwall or the Maior of the Towne, who asked vs
why we vsed such peremptory speeches to the Gouernor: COVERTE-E2-P2,30.44

We told him, we answered him in no worse manner then his place and
calling deserued, and that it was not for him to force vs to acquaint
him with our businesse to the <P_31> King, COVERTE-E2-P2,31.45

and then we shewed him the Can Canawes passe to the King.  Whereupon the
Gouernor came to vs again with twenty Gentlemen of the Towne, and by
all meanes intreated vs to stay all night, COVERTE-E2-P2,31.46

and whatsoeuer wee wanted that the country could afford, should be at
our seruice; COVERTE-E2-P2,31.47

and withall told vs, the way was dangerous, and very bad to trauell.
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.48

The next day we gaue him halfe a pound of Tobacco for a present,
which wee brought out of England, which he accepted very thankfully.
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.49

The thirteenth day wee came to a Towne called <font> Sawbon <$$font>,
some 14 course from <font> Caddor <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,31.50

but before wee were halfe a course out of the Towne, the Gouernour sent
12. Horsemen with Launces, Bowes and Arrowes, to conduct vs some
part of the way that was most dangerous, which was some 10. or
12. English miles.  COVERTE-E2-P2,31.51

And when we came to <font> Sawbon <$$font>, we found the <font> Carauand
<$$font> being 500. Camels bound for <font> Agro <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.52

And were laden with Taffateis, wrought Silkes, Cloth, Sugar, and other
Commodities, some from <font> Bramport <$$font>, some from <font> Bengalla
<$$font>, and some from <font> Cambaia <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,31.53

The 14. day we set forwards with the <font> Carrauand <$$font>
, COVERTE-E2-P2,31.54

and trauelled some 12. course to a Monastery called <font>
Tindey <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,31.55

The 15. day, we trauelled some 10. course
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.56

and lay in the woods.  COVERTE-E2-P2,31.57

The next day, we came to a great City called <font> Cannowe <$$font>,
where is much trading for Cloth, Swords, Shashes, Peeces, and Armour
tied on with strings, being but onely Arrow proofe.  COVERTE-E2-P2,31.58

There is great store of fruit, and colours for Diars, of all sorts:
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.59

and I thinke our English cloth would be an excellent commodity there:
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.60

for it is very cold, especially in January February and March,
COVERTE-E2-P2,31.61

for it beareth to the Northwards.  COVERTE-E2-P2,31.62

The 15. day we trauelled some 14 course to a great <P_32> Riuer
, called the Riuer of <font> Andee <$$font>, which is as broad as the
<font> Thames <$$font> at <font> Woolwich <$$font>, and runneth into
the Bay of <font> Bengalla <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.63

and this is the vtmost part or border of the <font> Gentiles <$$font>
, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.64

and one the 17. day we passed ouer the Riuer COVERTE-E2-P2,32.65

and went out of the <font> Gentiles <$$font> Countrey.
COVERTE-E2-P2,32.66

The <font> Gentiles <$$font> will eat nothing that bleedeth,
COVERTE-E2-P2,32.67

and the Sun is their great god.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.68

For, should they eat any thing that bleedeth, they beleeue that they
may eat the soules of their Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, or friends,
that are deceased: COVERTE-E2-P2,32.69

For, they say, that when any one dieth, their breath presently goeth
into one beast or other, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.70

& so, in eating that beast, a man may eat the soule of some friend
together with the flesh of that beast, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.71

such is their great blindenesse and ignorance.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.72

Nay more, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.73

they doe make euery liuing thing their Idols: as, the first liuing they
meete in the morning is their god or saint for that day, to worship that,
COVERTE-E2-P2,32.74

and so leauing the <font> Gentiles <$$font>, we come to the <font>
Bulloits <$$font>, or <font> Pithagoreans <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.75

The 17. day we came to the City of <font> Gorra <$$font>, where
are many <font> Surroyes <$$font>, or Innes, where Trauellers may set
their Camels, Horses or Catell, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.76

and cost nothing.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.77

Also there are four great Schooles for learning like to an Uniuersity:
COVERTE-E2-P2,32.78

In this Countrey were two Brothers being Kings sonnes, who warred for
this city, being eight miles in compasse, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.79

and in the middle a great wall, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.80

and there they laid their Seedge, a long time.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.81

And at the last the King of the East part got the victory,
COVERTE-E2-P2,32.82

and held the same for seuen yeeres, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.83

and then the great <font> Mogol Tamberlaine <$$font> the sixth ouercame
the whole Countrey COVERTE-E2-P2,32.84

and tooke it into his hands.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.85

The 18. day, we went ten course to a great Tanck or poole of water,
like vnto the Bath, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.86

the water boiling out of the earth COVERTE-E2-P2,32.87

and is very warme.  COVERTE-E2-P2,32.88

The 19. day, wee trauelled some 15. course to a Towne
called <font> Sanday <$$font> where is a great store of Wooll, like <font>
Spanish <$$font> Wool, COVERTE-E2-P2,32.89

heere are made great store of caps to couer Turbants, felt gownes to
ride in, both fine <P_33> and course, COVERTE-E2-P2,33.90

there are great store of sheepe, and so much Sugar, that they feed horses
therewith as we do with prouender, COVERTE-E2-P2,33.91

also there are goodly Surroies or Innes for horsemen and footmen.
COVERTE-E2-P2,33.92

The 20. day, wee trauelled some fifteene course to a great <font>
Surroy <$$font>, neere vnto a Monastery, where wee had great store of
fruit called <font> Mangoes <$$font> being like an apple, and haue a
stone as big as an Apricocke, and in sent or taste, COVERTE-E2-P2,33.93

and is excellent good for the Flixe, COVERTE-E2-P2,33.94

and are there much esteemed of.  COVERTE-E2-P2,33.95

The 21. day we trauelled twelue course to a small village, called
<font> Lee <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,33.96

The 22. day we trauelled some 16. course to a City called
<font> Esman <$$font>, where is a great Bussart or Market for the
countrey people, for Wooll, Cotten, Colten yearne, Swords, Jauelins,
and other weapons for the warres.  COVERTE-E2-P2,33.97

The 23. day, wee came to a little Towne called <font> Zingreene
<$$font>, some 14. course, where is great store of Oad, and
aboundance of Drugs for Diars.  COVERTE-E2-P2,33.98

The 24. day, we trauelled 16. course to a Citie called
<font> Barrandonn <$$font> where are great store of Merchants of
the <font> Bannians <$$font> and <font> Mesulipatanians <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,33.99

It is a City were the great <font> Carrauans <$$font> meet,
COVERTE-E2-P2,33.100

and there is great trade of Merchandise, for Cloth, Shashes, Armour,
for men and Horses, Coats of Male, Armour of Arrow proofe, bombast
Headpeeces, and Elephants teeth, also many wilde Elephants in the
Countrey: COVERTE-E2-P2,33.101

here we staied two daies COVERTE-E2-P2,33.102

and left our Carrauant in the City.  COVERTE-E2-P2,33.103

The 27. day we tooke our iourney forwards, COVERTE-E2-P2,33.104

and by the way we met with a Con or Knight of the Countrey, with fourty
Horse being bound for <font> Agro <$$font>, and fifty shot, with whom
we also kept company, being about 140. strong, COVERTE-E2-P2,33.105

and trauelled in the Desart some sixe daies, where are great store of
wilde Elephants, Lions, Tygars, Cat of Mountaines, Porpentines, <P_34>
and other wilde beasts innumerable, COVERTE-E2-P2,34.106

but those wee saw.  COVERTE-E2-P2,34.107

These Desarts are 100. course long, where euery night we made
great fires round about our tents, to shunne the dangers of the wilde
beasts: COVERTE-E2-P2,34.108

This Con or Knight told vs the nature or wit of the Elephant, who knowing
he is hunted to death for his teeth, will goe to a tree and there by
maine force will wring or wrest his teeth out of his head, knowing that
so he shall liue secure and free from that danger, COVERTE-E2-P2,34.109

and this he protested to be true.  COVERTE-E2-P2,34.110

The third of December, we past those Desarts COVERTE-E2-P2,34.111

and came to a Towne called <font> Tranado <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,34.112

The fourth day, we trauelled some 16. course to a Towne called
<font> Zaioberdee <$$font>, where is hay, corne, and graine, great plenty.
COVERTE-E2-P2,34.113

The fifth day we trauelled some 18. course to a City called
<font> Handee <$$font>, where the King hath a Castle and house, cut
out of the maine Rocke, and wrought with carued worke round about.
COVERTE-E2-P2,34.114

This Castle is inuincible, COVERTE-E2-P2,34.115

and hath fifty peeces of Ordinance in it.  COVERTE-E2-P2,34.116

There lay in this Castle, when wee were there 200. Knights,
Captaines, and other Gallants, that had transgressed the Law, or the
Kings commandement, as in Treson, Rebellion, and such like matters.
COVERTE-E2-P2,34.117

Also, in this City are two houses much like Saint <font> Iones <$$font>
, where Captaines and Cauiliers, that haue beene maimed, and hurt in the
warres, do liue, and haue each one a Mammothee a day being nine pence
English, and meat and drinke at the Kings allowance.  COVERTE-E2-P2,34.118

The 6. day we came to the Riuer of <font> Tamluo <$$font>, which
runneth into the Riuer <font> Indus <$$font>, which parteth the Countries
of the <font> Pythagoreans <$$font>, and the <font> Indestands <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,34.119

The <font> Pithagoreans <$$font> in former times haue beene a vile and
treacherous kinde of people, COVERTE-E2-P2,34.120

and had a Law that when the husband died, the wife should be also
burnt , which is holden till this day, though not in so strict a maner,
COVERTE-E2-P2,34.121

for now shee may refuse it but then <P_35> her head is shauen and she
clad in a blacke vesture or garment, which among them is reputed most
vile and hatefull, that the basest slaue in the Countrey will not succor
nor releeue her though she should starue.  COVERTE-E2-P2,35.122

Now, the cause why this Law was first made, was, for that the women
there were so fickle and inconstant, that, vpon any slight occasion of
dislike or spleene, they would poison their husbands.  Whereas now the
establishing and executing of this Law, is the cause that moueth the
wife to loue and cheerish her husband, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.123

and wisheth not to suruiue him.  COVERTE-E2-P2,35.124

As for example, I saw a young woman the wife of a Doctor, whose husband
being dead, shee made choise to bee carried in a Pageant, by foure men,
shee being cloathed in Lawne, and her head deacked with Jewels and rich
Ornaments, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.125

and before her went Musike of all sorts that the Countrey afforded,
as Hoeboies, Drums, fifes, and Trumpets, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.126

and next vnto her all her kindred, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.127

and so shee was brought to the place of Execution, where was a stake
and a hold to set her feet in, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.128

and so being tied to the stake, all her kindred kneeling round about her
, & praying to the sun and their other Idols, the fire was set to her,
she hauing vnder each arme a bagge of gunpowder, and a bagge betwixt her
legges, and so burnt to death, the fire being made of Beniamin, Storaxe,
Lignomalloes, and other sweet woods.  COVERTE-E2-P2,35.129

Thus much for the <font> Bulloits <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.130

and so to the <font> Indestands <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.131

and the next day we trauelled some ten course to a Towne called <font>
Addar <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,35.132

The eight day, wee trauelled some 26. course, COVERTE-E2-P2,35.133

and came to the great City of <font> Agro <$$font> where the great <font>
Mogoll <$$font> keepeth his Court and residence.  COVERTE-E2-P2,35.134

The ninth day Captaine <font> Hawkins <$$font> came to vs,
COVERTE-E2-P2,35.135

and brought vs before the King, as it is the custome and manner of
the Countrey.  COVERTE-E2-P2,35.136

For no stranger must stay aboue twenty foure houres before he be
brought before the King to know what hee is, and wherefore hee commeth.
COVERTE-E2-P2,35.137

<P_36>

Also euery stranger must present the King with some present, bee it
neuer so small, which hee will not refuse.  COVERTE-E2-P2,36.139

And I gaue him for a present, a small whistle of gold, waighing almost an
ounce, set with sparks of Rubies, which hee tooke and whisteled therewith
almost an houre.  COVERTE-E2-P2,36.140

Also I gaue him the picture of Saint <font> Iohns <$$font> head
cut in Amber and Gold, which hee also receiued very gratiously.
COVERTE-E2-P2,36.141

The whistle hee gaue to one of his great women, and the picture to <font>
Sultane Caroone <$$font> his yongest sonne.  COVERTE-E2-P2,36.142

His eldest son rebelled, COVERTE-E2-P2,36.143

and is in prison with his eies sealed vp, COVERTE-E2-P2,36.144

and it is noised amongst the common people that his eies are put out:
COVERTE-E2-P2,36.145

But it was told mee by a great man, that they are but sealed vp.
COVERTE-E2-P2,36.146

His name is <font> Patteshaw Shelham <$$font>, which in our language is
heire apparant to the Crowne: COVERTE-E2-P2,36.147

His second sonne liueth with him COVERTE-E2-P2,36.148

and is called <font> Sultane Nawbree <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,36.149

and him hee thinketh to make his heire apparant: COVERTE-E2-P2,36.150

His third sonne is called <font> Sultane Lawlle <$$font>,
COVERTE-E2-P2,36.151

and is Viceroy of <font> Lihorne <$$font>: COVERTE-E2-P2,36.152

His fourth sonne is called <font> Sultane Lill <$$font>,
COVERTE-E2-P2,36.153

and is Viceroy of the Gentiles, COVERTE-E2-P2,36.154

and these are his fiue sonnes.  COVERTE-E2-P2,36.155

Also hee hath ten Viceroys more vnder him, that gouern ten seuerall
Prouinces or Countries, <font> viz. Can Canow <$$font> Viceroy
of the <font> Guzarats <$$font>: <font> Can Iohn <$$font> Viceroy of
the <font> Bulloites <$$font>: <font> Michall Car <$$font> Viceroy of
the <font> Bannians <$$font>: <font> Howsouer Can <$$font>, Viceroy of
<font> Cambaia <$$font>: <font> Hodge Iohn <$$font>, Viceroy of <font>
Bengolla <$$font>: <font> Michaell Can <$$font>, Viceroy of the <font>
Hendownes <$$font>: <font> Sawder Can <$$font> Viceroy of the <font>
Puttans <$$font>, and hee lieth in the City of Candahar: <font> Alloe

City of <font> Buckera <$$font>: <font> Sawber Can <$$font>, Viceroy of
the <font> Multans <$$font>, and <font> Can Bullard <$$font> Viceroy of
the <font> Indestands <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,36.156

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_2}

<P_46>

The 23. day we went some 15. course COVERTE-E2-P2,46.159

and lay in the fields.  COVERTE-E2-P2,46.160

The 24. day, we went some fiue course COVERTE-E2-P2,46.161

and came to three Townes, <font> viz. Roree, Buckar <$$font>,
and <font> Sucker <$$font>, where is a gallant fresh Riuer, and small
ships that may goe to <font> Armoose <$$font>, as the Townsmen report.
COVERTE-E2-P2,46.162

Now the shipping belongeth to <font> Roree <$$font>, being some fifty
or sixtey saile, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.163

and are of the burden of fourty, fifty, and sixty tun, whereby there is
trade of Merchandize as far as the coast of <font> Molindee <$$font> ,
and as far as <font> Mosembique <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.164

and this Riuer falleth into the gulph of <font> Persia <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,46.165

<font> Buckar <$$font> standeth in the middle of the Riuer, which maketh
it in forme of an Iland, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.166

and is besides very strongly built.  COVERTE-E2-P2,46.167

The <font> Indians <$$font> cal this Riuer, the Riuer of <font> Damiadee
<$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,46.168

And in this towne of <font> Bucker <$$font>, lieth <font> Allee Can
<$$font> the <font> Mogols <$$font> Viceroy of the <font> Bullochies
<$$font>, who are such a stubborne & rebellious people that he keepeth
that strong hold of purpose to retire vnto, and to gather a head and
renew his forces, at all assaies, to subdue and keepe them in awe and
obedience, which notwithstanding he can hardly doe.  COVERTE-E2-P2,46.169

Also this <font> Allee Can <$$font> is a very worthy and bountifull Prince
, who gaue vs very gallant and kinde entertainment, and commended vs to
come dayly to his Court, where we had both costly and plentifull diet
at all times, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.170

and heere wee left <font> Io. Frencham <$$font> <paren> one of
our company <$$paren> sicke.  COVERTE-E2-P2,46.171

<font> Sucker <$$font> is a Towne consisting most of Weauers and Diars,
COVERTE-E2-P2,46.172

and liue by cloathing, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.173

and serue the Countrey round about, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.174

and this is the first Towne of the <font> Bullochies <$$font>.
COVERTE-E2-P2,46.175

And <font> Roree <$$font> {is} the last confine towne of the <font>
Multans <$$font> who are good husbandmen and painefull people, and
deale much in Merchandize, as Cloth, Indico, and other commodities,
and are very good people to deal withall, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.176

yet their Religion is Mahometicall.  COVERTE-E2-P2,46.177

At <font> Sucker <$$font> we staied 24. daies and more for a
Coffilo or Conuoy, COVERTE-E2-P2,46.178

For the Captaine of the Castle would not <P_47> suffer vs to goe without
one, because the way was dangerous and full of Theeues, which afterwards
we found true, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.179

for had we not <paren> by the great prouidence of God <$$paren> escaped
their hands, it had cost vs our liues, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.180

and yet it cost vs some money besides.  COVERTE-E2-P2,47.181

The 25. day of March, 1610. wee came from <font> Sucker
<$$font> COVERTE-E2-P2,47.182

and trauelled ouer the plaines some three course or thereabouts.
COVERTE-E2-P2,47.183

The 26. day wee trauelled through the woods or Desarts some three

The 27. day, wee went three course more through the Desarts,
COVERTE-E2-P2,47.185

and there wee tooke in water for two daies, which was but bad water
neither, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.186

but there was no better to be had, nor any towne to com to, vntill we
came to <font> Gorra <$$font>, some eight course distant from thence,
which was on the 28. day at night, where we rested two daies and
were very well vsed, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.187

yet being a Towne of the <font> Bullochies <$$font> and Rebels, wee were
in great feare, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.188

but we found no such cause, God be praised.  COVERTE-E2-P2,47.189

The <font> Bullochies <$$font> are Man-eaters, being men of huge limmes
and proportion euen giantlike, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.190

nor are they of any religion at all, saue only that they worship the
Sunne.  COVERTE-E2-P2,47.191

The 21. day, we came to <font> Norry <$$font>, being about
10. course, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.192

and this is the last Towne, of the <font> Bullochies <$$font>;
COVERTE-E2-P2,47.193

and so to the <font> Puttans.  <$$font> COVERTE-E2-P2,47.194

The first day of Aprill, we tooke our iourney ouer the plaines earely
in the morning, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.195

and about breake of day wee met with tenne or twelue men playing
on fiddles, as if they had come in friendly maner to welcome vs,
COVERTE-E2-P2,47.196

but indeed they were no better then Theeues that intended to rob and
pillege vs, COVERTE-E2-P2,47.197

for by the Sun rising wee were beset round with them and their
companions, whose certaine number wee could not discerne nor know.
COVERTE-E2-P2,47.198

And though wee had a Caffeloe or Conuoy of two <P_48> hundred strong,
yet wee were glad to intreate the Captaine of that vnruly Crew to stand
our friend, and both to bribe him priuatly, and to pay openly besides
in the name of a custom, twenty Checkeenoes in gold, COVERTE-E2-P2,48.199

nor would all this haue serued the turne, but for the <font> Mogols
<$$font> Passe vnder his hand and great seale, which they much feared,
but that all our throats had beene cut, as other in greater number had
formerly beene; COVERTE-E2-P2,48.200

yet at last vpon this friendly composition, they garded and
conducted vs through their Countrey, vntill wee were past all danger,
COVERTE-E2-P2,48.201

and so departed, COVERTE-E2-P2,48.202

and that day wee trauelled some nine course ouer the plaines,
COVERTE-E2-P2,48.203

and tooke vp our lodging in the plaine Fields.  COVERTE-E2-P2,48.204

COVERTE-E2-P2,48.209

This is a great and gallant Citie of the <font> Puttans <$$font>,
where <font> Sawdder Conuiceroy <$$font> of the <font> Puttans <$$font>
keepeth his Court and residence.  COVERTE-E2-P2,49.219

There is great and continuall traffique by land, from <font> Persia,
Indestand, Mesopotamia <$$font>, and from all partes betweene that and
<font> China <$$font>, with all sortes of merchandize and commodities
which those Countries yeelde; COVERTE-E2-P2,49.220

For there are continually 7. or 8. thousand Camels about
the Citie which trade to and fro with merchandize.  COVERTE-E2-P2,49.221

Also the viceroy hath continually 40000. horses for the warres in
readinessse for feare of Rebellion, because the <font> Puttans <$$font>
are a strong and warlike people, and inclined to rebellion, by reason
they came vnder the <font> Mogols <$$font> gouernment and subiection by
force and conquest, and therefore loue him not in their hearts, but obey
him for feare.  COVERTE-E2-P2,49.222

The 6. day of May we tooke our iourney for <font> Ispahawne
<$$font> in <font> Persia <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,49.223

and trauelled some 8 course that day, COVERTE-E2-P2,49.224

and came to a gallant Riuer where were two Townes on each side of the

COVERTE-E2-P2,49.230

and came to a great Riuer which diuideth the land of the <font> Puttans
<$$font> from <font> Persia <$$font>, COVERTE-E2-P2,49.231

and there we paid custome for our Owts or Camels COVERTE-E2-P2,49.232

and rested 2. daies by the Riuer side.  COVERTE-E2-P2,49.233

The 12. day we were ferried ouer the Riuer, which is called <font>
Sabbaa <$$font> to a castle a course from thence, and neer to a Towne
called <font> Grees.  <$$font> COVERTE-E2-P2,49.234

This Riuer diuideth the confines of the great <font> Mogoll <$$font>
and the King.  COVERTE-E2-P2,49.235

The <font> Puttans <$$font> are a warlike and goodly people,
COVERTE-E2-P2,49.236

and were <P_50> their beards long, which the <font> Mogols <$$font>
doe hate, COVERTE-E2-P2,50.237

also they worship the great God of heauen COVERTE-E2-P2,50.238

and despise <font> Mahomet <$$font>.  COVERTE-E2-P2,50.239

Their Priests goe in Sackcloth with great Chaines about their middles;
COVERTE-E2-P2,50.240

And doe fall downe and pray continuallie in Sackcloth and Ashes.
COVERTE-E2-P2,50.241

COVERTE-E2-P2,50.242
