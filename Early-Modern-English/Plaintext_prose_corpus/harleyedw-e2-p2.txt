As I much reioyce to be asshured of your health, as much as I inioye
my owne, so much more dous it reioyce me that the Lord dous so in mercy
incline your hart to seeke him, and that you finde sweetnes in his ways.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,11.13

The Lord, whoo only has the harts of men in his hands, keep your hart
cloose to his feare; that you may remember your Creator now, in the days
of your youth; that <P_12> in youth and old agge you may haue that joye
which surpases the joy of the world, that so in your old agg you may
say, Lord, remember thy sarvant whoo has allways desired to sarue thee.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.14

I did always thinke Mr. Longly would not stay long with my Lord,
of Middelsexcess; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.15

I whisth my Lord my brother had him.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.16

and now they haue a publicke assembely and a parlament in May or March,
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.27

I haue forgot which.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.28

I take this to be good nwes.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.29

but yesterday went to see him; when I was glad I did,
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.37

HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.38

They that weare with him did not perseauefe his illness:
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,12.39

To my deare sonne Mr. Edward Harley.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.55

<$$heading>

Good Ned - I haue now reseued your letter by my brother Brays man.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.57

I giue God thankes that you are recouered from that indispotion you
fellt, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.58

and thanke you that you did send me word of it; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.59

for I desire to knowe howe it is with you in all condistions.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.60

If you are ill, my knoweing of it stire me vp more ernestly to pray
for you.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.61

I beleeue that indispotion you feelt was caused by some violent exersise
: HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.62

if you vse to swinge, let it not be violently; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.63

for exersise should be rather to refresch then tyer nature.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.64

You did well to take some bolsome; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.65

it is a most sufferen thinge, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.66

and I purpos, if pleas God, to rwite you the vertues of it.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.67

Deare Ned, if I could as easely conuae meself to you as my letters,
I would not be so longe absent from you; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.68

but, sence I must waite for that comfort, I joy in this, that I asshure
meself, your prayers and mine meete dayly at the throne of grase.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.69

I must nowe tell you, your letter, by the carrier this weake, was wellcome
to me; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.70

and your father has reseued his from you, and one from your tutor.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.71

I take it for a greate bllesing, that your worthy tutor giues
so good a testimony of you, and that you esteme him so highely.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.72

I blles the Lord, that has giuen you fauor in his eyes, to seet his good
will vpon you.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.73

It is found experimentally true that conquerores must be as carefull to
keepe what they haue gained as they were to $obtain {TEXT:obtained} it.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.74

It is alike true, we must be, as carefull and stuedious to keepe
good opinions and affections towords vs as we weare to gaine them;
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.75

and I hope you will be a good practicinor of that leesson.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.76

Deare Ned, if you would haue any thinge, send me word;
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.77

or if I thought a coold pye, or such a thinge, would be of any plesure
to you, I would send it you.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.78

But your father says you care not for it, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.79

and Mrs. Pirson tells me, when her sonne was at Oxford,
and shee sent him such thinges, he prayed her that shee would not.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.80

I thanke you for the Man in the Moune.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.81

I had hard of the booke, but not seene it; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.82

by as much as I have $looked {TEXT:looke} vpon, I find it is some kine
to Donqueshot.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.83

I would willingly haue the French booke you rwite me word of;
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,13.84

but if it can be had, I desire <P_14> it in French, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.85

for I had rather reade any thinge in that tounge then in Inglisch.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.86

I know not sartainely wheather I haue it, tell I see it.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.87

Take it vpon likeing; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.88

if I haue it not, I will not return it backe.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.89

Your father was yesterday at Loudlow, wheare the caus was hard betwne S=r=
Gillberd Cornewell and his sisters, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.90

and it went against S=r= Gilberd Cornewell, to his shame.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.91

I thanke God, your father is well, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.92

and so is your brother Roberd, and all the rest.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.93

Smaleman has beueried his wife; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.94

and Mrs. Steuenson remaines very ill.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.95

Deare Ned, the Lord in heauen blles you, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.96

and giue you that principell of gras, which may neuer dye in you, but
that you may growe in gras, and so haue the fauor of your God, which
is better then life, and the fauor of good men, which small number is
worth all the millions of men besides.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.97

So, asshureing you that I will still reioyce to sheawe meself Your most
affectinat mother tel death, Brilliana Harley.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.98

I rwit to the last weake; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.99

send me word wheather you had my letter; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.100

I would not haue it loost.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.101

To my deare sonne, Mr. Edward Harley.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.106

<$$heading>

Good Need - This night Hall brought me your letter; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.108

but he is so perplexed aboute the horses that he seems not to be Hall.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.109

He was apointed by your father and meself to come downe by Oxford,
and to haue rested theare the Seboth; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.110

but the spoileing of the horses did so distract him, that he can not
say any thinge of Oxford or Loundoun.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.111

I rwite you worde by the carrier that your father did purpos to send to
you this weake: HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.112

my cosen Prisc sending for his horsess, your father takes that opertunity
to send to your tutor.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.113

I take it for a great mercy of God, that you haue your health;
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.114

the Lord in mercy continue it to you, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.115

and be you carefull of your selfe: HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.116

the meanes to presarufe health, is a good diet and exersise:
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,14.117

and, as I hope you are not wanteing in your care for your health, so I
hope you are much <P_15> more carefull for your soule, that that better
part of yours may growe in the wayes of knowledg.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.118

And in some proportion it is, with the soule as with the body;
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.119

theare must be a good dyet; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.120

we must feede vpon the worde of God, which when we haue doun we must
not let it lye idell, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.121

but we must be diligent in exersiseing of what we knowe,
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.122

and the more we practes the more we shall knowe.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.123

Deare Ned, let nothinge hinder you from performeing constant priuet
duties of prayeing and redeing.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.124

Experimentally, I may say that priuet prayer is one of the beest meanes
to keepe the hart cloos with God.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.125

O it is a sweet thinge to open our harts to our God, as to a frinde.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.126

If it had not bine for that I had recours to my God sheure I should haue
fainted before this.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.127

I heare no nwes at this time from Loundoun, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.128

only Mr. Wallker is still in prison; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.129

all my frinds theare are well, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.130

and I thanke God all your frindes are well heare.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.131

Your father is cheerefully well, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.132

and your brother Robert has had no fitte sence you went.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.133

Your brother Tomas cried very much the other day, becaus he thought howe
he was vsed to fight with you at Sheareswesbury.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.134

The Ember weake nowe drawes on a pase.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.135

I wisch you and your tutor weare heare then; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.136

howesoeuer I hope, you will in desires be with vs: HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.137

and so our prayers, I hope, shall meete in heauen, before the Lord.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.138

I thanke God, I am much better then when I rwite last to you.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.139

I beceach the Lord to blles you, and that you may be still the
beloued childe of Your most affectinat mother, Brilliana Harley.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.140

I haue sent a token to Mrs. Wilkinson: HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.141

it is a box.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.142

Doo not you vndoo the boxe; HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.143

but deleuer it to her, eather yourself, HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.144

or send it by Gorge Griffits.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.145

It is two cruets of chinna, with silluer and gilt couers, and bars
and feete.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.146

Doo not let the boxe be opened before she has it.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.147

I haue giuen my cosen Prisis man a great charge of the box.
HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.148

If it come safe, I will giue him a reward.  HARLEYEDW-E2-P2,15.149
