<P_53.C1>

<font> Fal. <$$font> Yes: a Buck-basket: SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.503

ram'd mee in with foule Shirts and Smockes, Socks, foule Stockings,
greasie Napkins, that <paren> Master <font> Broome <$$font> <$$paren>

Being thus cram'd in the Basket, a couple of <font> Fords <$$font> knaues,
his Hindes, were cald forth by their Mistris, to carry mee in the name
of foule Cloathes to <font> Datchet-lane <$$font>: SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.507

met the iealous knaue their Master in the doore; who ask'd them once or

I quak'd for feare least the Lunatique Knaue would have search'd it:

But marke the sequell <paren> Master <font> Broome <$$font> <$$paren>
SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.514

First, an intollerable fright, to be detected with a iealious rotten
Bell-weather: SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.516

Next to be compas'd like a good Bilbo in the circumference of a Pecke,
hilt to point, heele to head.  SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.517

And then to be stopt in like a strong distillation with stinking Cloathes
, that fretted in their owne grease: SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.518

thinke of that, a man of my Kidney; SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.519

thinke of that, that am as subiect to heate as butter; a man of continuall
dissolution, and thaw: SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.520

it was a miracle to scape suffocation.  SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.521

And in the height of this Bath <paren> when I was more then halfe
stew'd in grease <paren> like a Dutchdish <$$paren> to be throwne into

SHAKESP-E2-P2,53.C1.522
