June y=e= 28, $1690.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,152.3

I was not capable, my Lord, y=e= last post of acquainting y=ur= L=dpps=
of y=e= ill news of M=r= Hatton being sent to y=e= Tower by y=e=
Privy Counsell, for high treason, for writing a book w=ch= he owned.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,152.4

He is <P_2,153> now a close prisoner.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.5

I resolve to goe to him next week, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.6

and I must be confined.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.7

I have indeavoured to a got leve to a gon out and in,
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.8

but it will not be granted.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.9

I am in great hopes y=r= L=dpps= will be in town before I goe to y=e=
Tower.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.10

He went a Thursday night, w=ch= prevented his writing to y=r= L=dpps=.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.11

He sent down 2 books by y=e= carrier.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.12

Y=e= dicktionary, w=ch= y=r= L=dpps= sent to know y=e= price {of},
is seven and twenty shillings.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.13

I beg my humble servis to my Lady and my sister Hatton.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.14

I hope they will pardon me in not writing, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.15

for my sorrows are soe great it makes me not able to pay my duty.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.16

My most humble servis to y=r= L=dpps=, my Lady, my sister Hatton.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.17

I am y=r= L=dpps= Most faithfull, Humble serv=t=, E. Hatton.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.18

I hope y=r= L=dpps= will pardon me, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.19

for I doe not know what I say, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.20

I am in such amaise.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.21

July y=e= 3, $1690.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.23

I received y=r= Ld=pps= kind letter, w=ch= at this present time I doe
much want.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.24

I could wish I wase able to give y=r= Ld=pps= a true account of what M=r=
Hatton is acused of; EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.25

but I am very ignorant, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.26

for I did not in y=e= least know of anything tell y=e= messenger came
for him, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.27

and then I had not time to inquire of him, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.28

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} larne of any person that have seen it what
is in it, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.29

but most doe say there is nothing in that can tuch his life.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.30

I trust in God $'t $is {TEXT:tis} true; EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.31

but they have peech him of high treason, w=ch= makes a great sound.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.32

He is kept a very close prisoner, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.33

for wee $can $not {TEXT:cannot} get leave that any person should be
admited, tho a warder is by.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.34

I have don all I can in y=e= world to get leave to goe into y=e= Tower,
tho I am willing to be a close prisenor; EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.35

for he hath noebody w=th= him, EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,153.36

and, should he be <P_2,154> sick, it may prove of a very ill consequence.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.37

As for getting him bailed, it is impossible to have it don,
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.38

for there is noe hopes of his coming out tell next term,
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.39

and his clos confinement I much fear will much prejudice his health.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.40

I beg of y=r= Ld=pps= to writ to y=e= President that he may have y=e=
liberty of y=e= Tower, and that he may be aloud that sumtimes he may
see his frends or those persons w=ch= he hath reall business w=th=
concerning his one affairs.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.41

And allsoe I humble beg y=r= Ld=pps= will be pleased to writ to som
of y=e= Privi Counsell, that I may have order to goe into y=e= Tower,
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.42

for I will asure y=r= Ld=pps= I am under soe much sorrow that $'t
$is {TEXT:tis} impossibell to be exprest, or can I support myself,
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.43

for I can declare I have sleept not one houre in a night sence he hath
ben there.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.44

I have another favor to desire of y=r= Ld=pps=, that y=u= would be pleased
to consider his condition, and that y=e= place is very chargeable, and
noe person that he doe owe but sixpence to but is pressing and rude, w=ch=
makes me exposed daly to great inconveniencys.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,154.45

I am y=r= Ld=pps= most faithfull, humble servent, E. Hatton.

come home soe sune but to meet y=e= D=trs= and sirgent about my son,
w=ch= is in a very weak condition.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.53

M=r= Hatton does asure me there was never anything offerd in y=e= least
to him or proposed sence his confinem=t=.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.54

He fears he shall not be bailed.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.55

He hopes he shall have y=e= freedom of seeing his frends, w=ch= as yet
he hath not.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.56

If y=r= L=dpps= could obtain that favor, it would be to his satisfaction .
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.57

As for anything elce, he beleives it is to noe purpose for y=r= L=dpps=
to give y=r=self y=e= trouble as yet to endeavor.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.58

He gives his most humble servis to yr Ld=pps=, my Lady.
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.59

Sence I came to y=e= Tower her hath com to or 3 frends,
EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.60

but I suppose it will be forbid if any more should come, they hereing
I had an order, w=ch= maid them conclude he had y=e= freedom of seeing
his frends.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.61

If I did in y=e= least know that anything had been propose to M=r= Hatton,
I doe asure y=r= Ld=pps= I would let y=u= know.  EHATTON2-E3-P2,2,158.62
