<font> Master Bayly.  Doctor Rat.  <$$font> STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.290

<font> Bailie <$$font> I can perceiue none other, I speke it from my
hart But either ye ar in al the fault or els in y=e= greatest part
STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.291

<font> D. Rat <$$font> If it be counted his fault, besides all
his greeues When a poore man is spoyled: and beaten among theeues?
Then I confesse my fault herein, at this season, STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.292

But I hope you wil not iudge so much against reason.
STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.293

<font> Baily <$$font> And me thinkes by your owne tale, of all
that ye name, If any plaid the theefe you were the very same.
STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.294

The women they did nothing, as your words make probation
STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.295

But stoutly withstood your forcible inuasion, STEVENSO-E1-P2,51.296

<P_52>

If that a theefe at your window, to enter should begin, Wold you hold
forth your hand, and helpe to pull him in: STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.298

Or you wold {COM:sic} kepe him out: STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.299

<font> D. Rat <$$font> Mary kepe him out, STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.301

But I am no theefe sir but an honest learned Clarke, STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.303

<font> Baily <$$font> Yea, but who knoweth that, when he meets you in
the darke STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.304

I am sure your learning shines not out at your nose, STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.305

Was it any maruaile, though the poore woman arose And start vp, being
afraide of that was in hir purse STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.306

Me thinke you may be glad that your lucke was no worse.
STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.307

<font> D. Rat <$$font> Is not this euill ynough, I pray you as you
thinke, <font> Showing his broken head.  <$$font> STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.308

<font> Baily <$$font> Yea but a man in the darke, if chaunces do wincke,
As soone he smites his father, as any other man, Because for lacke of
light, discerne him he ne can, STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.309

Might it not haue ben your lucke, w=t= a spit to haue ben slaine:
STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.310

<font> D. Rat <$$font> I thinke I am litle better,
STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.311

If there be all the remedy, I know who beares the knockes.
STEVENSO-E1-P2,52.313

<font> Baily <$$font> By my troth and well worthy, besides to kisse
the stockes To come in on the backe side, when ye might go about,
<P_53> I know non such, vnles they long to haue their braines knockt

<font> Bayly <$$font> Let her be called fellow because of master doctor
, STEVENSO-E1-P2,53.317

I warrant in this case, she wil be hir owne Proctor, STEVENSO-E1-P2,53.318

She will tel hir owne tale in metter or in prose, And byd you seeke your
remedy, STEVENSO-E1-P2,53.319

and so go STEVENSO-E1-P2,53.320
