papistes, immediately after the proclamacyone of quene Mary att London,
she beynge in Norfoulke.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,134.4

<$$heading>

The next daye after the quene was come unto the Tower, the foresayde
ballett came unto the handes off secretary Borne, who strayte wayes made
inquiry for me the sayde Edwarde, who dwelled att the Lymehurst; wiche
he having intellygence off, sentt the shreffe <P_135> of Mydellsex, with
a company off bylles and gleves, who came unto my housse, I beynge in my
bedde, and my wyffe newly leayde in chylde-bedde.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.6

The hygh constable, whose name is Thomas Ive, dwelled att the next house
unto me the sayde Edwarde, whome the shreffe brought also with hym;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.7

he beynge my very ffrende, desyred the shreffe and his company to

UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.8

and he wolde goo feche me unto hym, who knokede att the doore saynge he
must speke with me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.9

I lyinge so nere that I might here hym, called unto hym, wyllynge hym to
come unto me, for thatt he was alwayes my verye frende and earnest in the
Gospelle; who declared unto me that the shreffe, with a greate company
with hym, weare sentt for me.  Whereuppon I rose, made me redy, and came
unto hym demaundynge what he wolde with me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.10

"Sir, <paren> sayde he, <$$paren> I have commanundementt fromme the
councelle to aprehende yow, and forthewith to brynge yow unto them.
"UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.11

"Why, <paren> sayde I, <$$paren> it is now x off cloke in the nyght,
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.12

ye $can $nott {TEXT:cannott} now cary me unto them. "
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.13

"No, syr, <paren> sayde he, <$$paren> you shall go with me to my house,
to London, wheare yow shall have a bedde, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.14

and to-morrowe I wyll brynge yow unto them att the Tower. "
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.15

"In the name of God! "<paren> sayde I, <$$paren> UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.16

and so wentt with hym, requyryng hym yff I myght understande the cause.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.17

He sayde, he knew none.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.18

"This nedede not then, <paren> sayde I; <$$paren> UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.19

any one mesenger myght have feched me unto them;"UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.20

suspectynge the cause to be, as it was indede, the ballett.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.21

On the morrow, the shreffe, seynge me nothynge dismayde, thynkyng it to
be sume lyght matter, wentt nott wyth me hymselfe, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.22

butt sent me unto the Tower wyth too of his men, waytynge upon me with two
bylles, presoner-lyke, who brought me unto the councell chamber, beynge
comaundyd to delyver me unto secretary Bourne.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,135.23

Thus standynge waytynge at the councelle chamber doore, too or <P_136>
thre off my fellowes the pencyoners, and my cosyn jarmene Gilbarte Wynter
, jentylman ussher unto the ladye Elizabethe, stoode talkynge with me.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,136.24

In the meanetyme commithe sir Edwarde Hastynges, newly made master off
the horse to the quene, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,136.25

and seyng me standynge there presoner, frownynge earnestly uppon me,
sayde,"Are yow cume?  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,136.26

we wylle talke with yow or yow parte, I warrantt yow,"
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,136.27

and so went into the councell.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,136.28

With that my fellowes and kynsemane shranke away from me as men greately
affrayde.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,136.29

I dide then parseave the sayde syr Edwarde bare in remembraunce the
contraversy thatt was bytwyxt hym and me in talke and questions off
relegyone att Callis, when the ryght honorable the yerle off Hyntyngetune
his brother wentt over generalle off vj. thowsande men, with
whom I wentt the same tyme and was comtroler off the <P_137> ordynaunce.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.30

The earle beynge veseted with syknes when he came thether, for thatt
I wentt over in his company, and could pley and synge to the lute,
therwith to pass awaye the tyme on the nyghtes beynge lounge, for we
wentt over in the Cristmas, wolde have me with hym in his chamber,
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.31

and hadde also a greate delyght to heare his brother reasone with me
in matters of relegione, who wolde be very hote when I dide overley hym
with the textes off the screpture concernynge the naturalle presens of
Crist in the sacramentt of the alter, and wolde sweare greate othes,
specyally"by the Lord's foote,"thatt after the words spokyne by the
prist ther remayned no breade, but the naturalle body thatt Mary bare.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.32

"Naye, then it muste needes be so, <paren> wolde I saye, <$$paren> and

sayinge,"Brother, geve hym over; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.33

Underhylle is $too goode for yow. "Wherwith he wolde be very angrye.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.34

The greatest holde thatt he toke was off the thyrde off John, and all
other places thatt he coulde aleage; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.35

but frome this he wolde nott be removed, butt thatt those wordes
proved his naturalle body to be in heaven and in the sacramentt also.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.36

I tolde hym he as grosely understode Cryst as Nicodemus dyde in the same
place, off beynge borne anew; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,137.37

in my oppinnione any mane that is nott gevyne upe of God maye be satysfyde

Undoutedly the aprehendynge off me was for this matter;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,138.39

butt the greate mercy off God so provided for me thatt mr.
Hastynges was not att my examynacyone, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,138.40

for taryinge thus att the councelle chamber doore, doctor Coxks

UNDERHILL-E1-P2,138.41

Immediatly as $they hadde dyned, secretarye Bourne came to the doore

UNDERHILL-E1-P2,144.142

So went I forthe with my too fellowes of the garde, who weare gladd they

"Where is thatt knave the painter? "sayde mr. Gage.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,144.145

"I know nott,"sayde I.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,144.146

When we came to the Tower gate, wheroff syr John Abryges hadd the charge
, and his brother mr. Thomas, with whome I was well aquaynted,
butt nott with syr John; who, seynge they $two off the garde leadynge

"I am glade of thatt,"sayde he.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,144.150

And so forthe we wentt at the gate, where was greate throunge off people
to heare and se whatt presonars weare committed, and amoungst whome
stoode my frende mr. Ive, the hygh constable, my next neyghboure.

One off the garde wentt forthe att the weked before <P_145> me to take

the other helde me by the other arme, fearynge be lyke I wolde have

When my frende sawe me thus leade, who hadd wachede att the gate all

shulde become off me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,145.154

Many also followed, sum thatt knewe me, some to larne whatt I was,

Thus passed we thorow the stretes welle accompanyed unto mr. Garett

These $two off the garde declared unto mr. shreffe thatt they

"With a goode wylle,"sayde mr. sherffe.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,145.162

"Masters, <paren> sayde he, <$$paren> you maye departe;

"We wylle se hym caryed, syr, <paren> sayde they, <$$paren> for ower

With thatt they departede.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,145.168

My frend mr. Ive, seynge them departe, and leave me behynde,

He sentt me on the morowe xx s., and every weke as moche wyle I
was in Newgate.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.172

When these too companyons off the garde weare goone, the shreffe sentt
too off his offycers with me, who toke no billes with them, nor leadde
me not, butt followed a prety waye behynde me, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.173

ffor as I sayde unto mr. shreffe, butt for order sake, and to save
hym blameles, I wolde have gone unto Newgate myselffe att the counceles
commaundementt, or his other.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.174

When I came into the strete, my frende mr. Ive, seyng me have
suche libertie, and souche distaunce betwyxt me and the offyceres,
he stepped before them, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.175

and so went talkynge with me thorow Chepesyde; so thatt it was nott
welle perseaved thatt I was aprehendide, butt by the greate company
thatt followed.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.176

The offyceres delyvered me unto the keper off Newgate as they were
commaunded, who unloked a dore, and willed me to goo upe the steares
into the halle.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.177

My frende Ive wente upe with me, where we founde 3 or 4 presonars thatt
hadde the libertie off the howse.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.178

After a littelle talke with my frende, I requyred hym nott to lett my
wyffe know thatt I was sende to Newgate, butt to the Counter, untyll
suche tyme thatt she weare nere her churcheynge, and thatt she sulde
sende me my nyghte gowne, my bible, and my lute; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.179

and soe he departede.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,146.180

<P_147>

In a wyle after it was supper tyme.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,147.182

The borde was covered in the same halle.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,147.183

The keper, whose name was Alesaunder, and his wyffe came to supper
, and halffe a dosyn presonars thatt weare ther for feloneys;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,147.184

for I was the fyrst for relegyon thatt was sentt unto thatt presone,
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,147.185

butt the cause why the keper knue nott.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,147.186

One off those presonars toke acquayntaunce off me, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,147.187

and sayde he was a sodyare under syr Rycharde Crumewell in the jurney
to <P_148> Laundersey, where he dide knowe me, whose sarvant I was at
the same tyme; who the next yere followyng, when the famous kynge Henry
viij=th= wentt unto Bollene, he putt me unto his majestie in the rome of
a mane att armes, off the wiche bande ther was ij=c= off us uppon barded
horsses, alle in one sute off readde and yalloo damaske, ower bardes off
ower horses and plumes off fethers of the same colars, to attend uppon
his majestie for the defense off his parsone.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,148.188

After supper this goode fellow, whose name was Brysto, procured me
to have a bedde in his chamber; who coulde pley well uppon a rebyke.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,148.189

He was a talle mane, and afterwardes on off quene Maryes garde, and yett
a protestayne, wich he kepte secrete, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,148.190

for eles he sayde he shulde nott have founde souche favour as he dide
att the $keper's handes and his wyff, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,148.191

for to souche as loved the gospelle they weare very cruell.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,148.192

"Welle, <paren> sayd I, <$$paren> I have sende <P_149> for my bible,
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.193

and, by Godes grace, therin $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} my dayly exersyse ;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.194

I wylle nott hyde it frome them. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.195

"Syr, <paren> sayde he, <$$paren> I am poore; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.196

butt they will beare with you, for thatt they see your estate is to paye

and I wyll show you the nature and maner off them, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.198

for I have byne heare a good wyle.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.199

They bothe do love musyke very welle; wherfore yow with your lute,
and I to pley with yow on my rebyke, wylle please them greately;

and some musyke, yow $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} ther whyte sone, and have
alle ther favour thatt they cane show yow. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.202

And so it came to pass.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.203

And now I thynke it goode a litle to dygrese frome my matter concernynge
my impresonmentt and my delyveraunce; and to note the greate mercy off God
showed unto his sarvantes in thatt greate parsecusyone in quene Mary's
tyme; howe myghtelie and $how {TEXT:how_missing_in_text} many wayes
he presarved souche as dide feare hym, evyne as he presarved Danyelle,
Jeremy, Paulle, and many in the olde tyme.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.204

Sume weare moved by his spirite to fle over the seyes;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.205

sume weare presarved stylle in Londone, thatt in all the tyme off
parsecusyone never bowed ther knes unto Balle, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.206

for ther was no souche place to shyft in in this realme as Londone,
notwithstandynge ther greate spyalle and shearche; nor no better place
to shifte the Easter tyme in $then {TEXT:ther} quene Maryes courte,
sarvynge in the rome thatt {in} I dide, as $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe}
showed hereafter.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.207

A greate noumber God dide strengthen constantly to stande to his worde
, to gloryfye his name, wiche be praysede for ever and ever, worlde
withoute ende!  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.208

And sume he presarved for these dayes.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.209

And now agayne to prosecute the matter of my trouble and
wonderfull delyveraunce owt off thatt lothsume gayle off Newgate.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,149.210

When thatt I hadde byn ther abowte too wekes, thorow the evylle savers
and greate unquyettnes off the logeynges, as also by occasyon <P_150>
off drynkenge off a draught off strounge {COM:'malmesey'_erased} holloke
as I was goynge to bedde, wyche my chamber fellow wolde nedes have me to
plege hym in, I was cast into an extreame burnynge ague, thatt I coulde
take no reste, desirynge to chaunge my logenge, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.211

and so dide frome oon to another; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.212

butt noone I coulde abyde, ther was so mouche noyse off presonars,
and evyll savours.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.213

The keper and his wyffe offered me his owne parler where he laye hymselffe
, wyche was fforthist from noyse, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.214

butt it was nere the kechyn, the savour wheroff I coulde nott abyde.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.215

Then dide she lay me in a chamber where she sayde never no presoner laye ,
wiche was her store-chamber, where she sayde all her plate and money laye,
wyche was mouche.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.216

So mouche frendshepe I founde att ther handes, notwithstandynge thatt
they weare spoken unto by dyvers papistes; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.217

and the Woodmoungeres of London, withe whome I hadde a greate conflycte
for presentynge them for false markynge off bylettes, they requyred
the keper to show me no favour, and to laye yrones uppon me, declarynge
thatt I was the greatist heretyke in London.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,150.218

My very frende mr. Recorde, doctor off phesyke, syngularly <P_151>
sene in alle the seven syencis, and a greate devyne, visited me in the
presone, and also after I was delyvered, to his greate parrelle yff
it hadde byne knowne, who lounge tyme was att charges and payne with
me gratis.  By meanes whereoff and the provydence off God I reseaved
my healthe.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,151.219

My wyffe then was churched befoore her tyme to be a suter for my
delyveraunce, who put upe a supplycacyone unto the councelle, declarynge
my extreame syknes, and smalle cause to be committed unto so louthsome
a gayle; requyrynge thatt I myght be delyvered, puttynge in sureties
to be forthecumynge to aunswere farther when I shuld be called ;
wiche she obteyned by the healpe off mr. John Througemarton,
beynge the master off the questes, and my cunetremane and kynesmane;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,151.220

he, understandynge <P_152> who weare my enemyes, toke a tyme in ther
absens, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,152.221

and obteyned a letter to the keper, subscrybed by the yearle of Bedforde
, the yearle of Sussex, Wynchester, Rochester, and Walgrave, to be
delyvered, puttynge in suretye, accordynge to the requeste off my wyves
supplycacyon; with whome Wynchester talked concernynge the crestenynge
off her chylde att the churche att the Tower hylle, and the gossipes,
wiche weare, the duke of Suffolke, the yearle of Penbroke, and the
lady Jane then beynge quene, with the whiche he was moche offendide.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,152.222

My ladie Througemartone, wyfe unto syr Nycolas Througemartone, was the
<P_153> quenes debetie, who named my sone Gylfforde after her husebande.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.223

Immediately after the crestenynge was done, quene Marye was proclaimed
in Chepesyde, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.224

and when me ladie Througemartone came into the Tower, the clothe off
estate was takone downe and all thynges defaced: UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.225

a sodene chaunge!  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.226

She wolde have goone forthe agayne, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.227

butt colde nott be suffered.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.228

Butt nowe agayne to the matter.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.229

When my wyff hadde obtained the letter, joyfull she was,
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.230

and brought her brother with her, John Speryne of Londone marchantt,
a very frendly mane, and zelous in the Lorde, who was bounde with me
before mr. Chedely justice off peace, accordynge to the counceles
lettres, who came into the presone unto me, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.231

for I was so syke and weake thatt I was constrayned to tary a wyle longer
, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.232

and my wyffe with me daye and nyghte.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.233

Durynge alle the tyme off my sykness, I was constrayned to paye viij
d. every meale, and as moche for my wyffe, and for every frende
thatt came to se me, yf they weare alone with me att dyner or supper tyme,
whether they came to the table or noo; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.234

and payde also xl s. for a ffyne for iernes, wyche they sayde
they showede me greate favoure in, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.235

I shulde eles have payd iiij or v li.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.236

Thus when they parseaved I dide nott amende, butt rather worse and worse ,
they thought it best to venter the matter, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.237

and provydede a horse-litter to cary me home to the Lyme hurst.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.238

I was so weake thatt I was not able to be ledde downe the steares;
wherefore on thatt was sarvant to the jaler, who before tyme hade
byne my mane, who was also very diligentt and frendely unto me, toke
me in his armes and caryed me downe the steares to the horse-litter,
wiche stoode redy att the presone doore, and went with me to my howse.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,153.239

Many people weare gathered to se my comynge forthe, who praysed <P_154>
God for my delyverance, beynge very sory to se my state, and the
lamentacyone off my wyff and her frendes, who jugede I wolde nott leve
untyll I came hoome.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.240

I was nott able to endure the goynge off the horse-litter; wherefore they
weare fayne to goo very softely, and oftentymes to staye, att wiche tymes
many of my aquayntaunces and ffrendes and others resortede to se me ,
so thatt it was too howres or we coulde pass frome Newgate unto Algate
, and so within nyght before I coulde gett to my howse, wheare many
off my neyghboures resorted to se me takone owte off the horse-litter,
whoo lamentedde and prayde for me, thynkynge it nott possible for me to
escape deathe, butt by the greate mercy of God.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.241

Thus I contyneued the space of viij or x dayes, withowte any lykelyhoode
or hoope off amendementt.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.242

I was sende to Newgate the v=th= daye off August, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.243

and was delyvered the v=th= daye off September.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.244

The fyrste daye off October was quene Mary crowned, by wiche tyme I was
able to walke upe and doune my chamber; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.245

and beynge very desyrous to se the quene pase thorow the cittie,
gott uppe on horsebake, beynge scantt able to sett, gyrdide in a longe
nyghtgowne with double kercheves aboute my heade, a greate hatt uppon
them, my bearde dubed harde too; my face so leane and pale thatt I was
the very image off deathe; wondred at off alle thatt dide beholde me,
unknowne to any.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.246

My wyffe and neyghboures weare to-to sorry thatt I wolde nedes goo forthe
, thynkynge I wolde nott returne alyve.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.247

Thus wentt I forthe, havynge off ether syde off me a mane to staye me;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.248

and so wentt to the west ende off Polles, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.249

and ther placed myselfe amoungst others thatt satte on horsebake to se
the quene pase by.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.250

Before her cumeynge I behelde Poles steple bearynge toppe and
toppe-galantt lyke a ryalle sheppe with many flages and bannars, and a
mane tryoumfynge and daunsynge in the toppe.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,154.251

<P_155>

I sayde unto one thatt sate on horsebake by me, who hadde nott sene any
corownacyone,"Att the coronasyone off kynge Edwarde I sawe Poles steple
ly att ane anker, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,155.253

and now she wearithe toppe and toppe-gallantt; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,155.254

surely the nexte $will $be {TEXT:wylbe} shippewrake, or it be lounge;
"whiche chauncethe sume tymes by tempestuous wyndes, sume tymes by
lyghtnynges and fyre from the hevens.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,155.255

Butt I thowghte thatt it shulde rather periche with sume horible wynde
then with lyghtnynge or thounderbolt; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,155.256

butt souche are the <P_156> wonderfulle workes off God, whose gonnares
$will $nott {TEXT:wylnott} mysse the marke thatt he dothe apoynte,
be it never so little.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.257

When the quene passed by, many behelde me, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.258

for they myght almost touche me, the rome was so narrow, marvelynge belyke
that one in souche state wolde venter forthe.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.259

Many off my fellowes the pencyonars, and others, and dyvers off the
councelle behelde me, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.260

and noone off theme all knewe me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.261

I myght heare them saye one to another,"There is one lovithe the quene
welle belyke, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.262

for he venterith greately to see her; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.263

he is very lyke never to se her more. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.264

Thus my men thatt stoode by me hard many of them saye, whose hearynge
was quyker then myne.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.265

The quene herselfe when she past by behelde me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.266

Thus mouche I thought goode to wryte, to show how God dothe presarve
thatt semithe to mane impossyble, as many thatt daye did juge off me.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.267

Thus returned I hoome, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.268

and abowte to monethes after I was able to walke to London ane easy pace;
butt stylle with my kercheves and pale lene face.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.269

I muffeled me with a sarcenett, wiche the rude people in the strettes
wolde murmure att, sayinge,"What is he?  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.270

Dare he nott show his face? "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.271

I dyde repayre to my olde familiare acquayntaunce, as drapers, mercers,
and others, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.272

and stoode talkynge with them UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.273

and cheponed ther wares; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.274

and nott one off them thatt knew me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.275

Then wolde I saye unto them,"Do you nott know me?  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.276

loke better uppone me.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.277

Do you nott know my voyce? "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.278

For thatt was also altered.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.279

"Truly, <paren> wolde they saye, <$$paren> yow must pardone me;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.280

I $can $nott {TEXT:cannott} calle you to rememberaunce. "
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.281

Then wolde I declare my name unto them; whereatt they so marveled thatt
they colde scarcely credite me, butt for the famelyare acquayntaunce
thatt I putt them in rememberance off.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,156.282

Thus passed I forthe the tyme att the Lyme hurst untyll crystmas <P_157>
was past, thatt I waxed somethynge strounge, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.283

and then I thought it best to shifte frome thence, for thatt I hadde
there ferce enemys, specyally the vycker of Stepney, abbot <font> qondame
<$$font> off Tower hylle, whome I aprehendide in kynge Edwardes tyme,
and caryed hym unto Croydone to Cranemer, bishope of Caunterbery ; for
thatt he distourbed the prechers in his churche, causynge the belles
to be rounge when they weare att the sermone, and sume tymes begyne to
synge in the quere before the sarmone weare halffe done, and sume tymes
chalenge the precher in the pulpitt; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.284

for he was a strounge, stowte popyshe prelate, whome the godly mene off
the paryshe weare wearye off; specyally my neyghboures of the Lyme hurst,
as mr. Dryver, mr. Ive, mr. Poynter, mr.
Marche, and others.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.285

Yet durst $they nott medelle with hym untylle it was my happe to cume
dwelle amoungst them; UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.286

and for thatt I was the kynges sarvantt I toke uppone me;
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.287

and they wentt with me to the bishope to wittnes those thynges agaynst
hym.  Who was to fulle off lenite: UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.288

a litle he rebuked hym, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.289

and badde hym doo no more soo.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.290

"Me lorde, <paren> sayde I, <$$paren> me thynkes yow are to jentylle
unto so stowte a papiste. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.291

"Welle, <paren> sayde he, <$$paren> we have no lawe to ponyshe them
by. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.292

"We have, me lorde, <paren> sayde I; <$$paren> UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.293

yff I hadde your auctoryte I wolde be so bolde to unvycker hym,
or mynnester sume sharpe ponyshementt unto hym and souch other.
UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.294

Yff ever it cume to ther turne, they wyll show yow no souch favoure.
"UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.295

"Well, <paren> sayde he, <$$paren> yff God so provyde, we must abyde
it. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.296

"Surely, <paren> sayde I, <$$paren> God wyll never cone yow thank for
this, butt rather take the sworde from souche as wylle nott use it uppon
his enemyes. "UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.297

And thus we departed.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.298

The lyke favoure is showed now, UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.299

and therfore the lyke plage wylle follow.  UNDERHILL-E1-P2,157.300
