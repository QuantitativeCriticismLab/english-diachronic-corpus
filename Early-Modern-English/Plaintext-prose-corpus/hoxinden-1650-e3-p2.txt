<heading:edcomment:CIV_HENRY_OXINDEN_TO_KATHERINE_OXINDEN>

Endeared, I have not yet seene your letter of Tuesday mentioned in yoars
of No: 4=th=.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,166.3

I sent you one by last Thursday <P_167> post wherein I certifyed you of
another foile Mr. Denne received in the open court, insomuch as I
and my Cozin Roberts conceave the most troublesome of all our businesses
is over.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.4

His Refuge since hath beene to stop my seeing him uppon my Recognizance
of 5000=ll= and bond of 3000=ll=, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.5

and to that end, the 5=th= of this instant, hee endeavored to gaine an
injunction and to hinder the examination of what I have been damnified;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.6

and in that very thing before the Lords Commissioners att Westminster
Hall, I foyled him once more, the businesse going att my side, my Cozin
Robart Hales being present and assisting.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.7

I doubt not <paren> as you say <$$paren> hee will and hath done his worst;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.8

but hee will certainly <paren> and you know itt is not my way to
bee confident without good cause <$$paren> in the end come off with
dishonour , and bee forced to pay those monies hee leaves uppon mee
to pay.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.9

Concerning our daughter Hobart I hope for no other then what you say
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.10

but going downe yesterday after my Tryall at Westminster Hall to the La:
Zouch, to see how thinges stood there, and coming in just as the La:
was att dinner <paren> with whom Sir Peter Kelligrey who lately arrived
out of France was then sate downe to dinner <$$paren> I was importuned
to sett downe HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.11

and did accordingly.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.12

There dined our daughter Hobart, and my Cozin Harry, Allen and Dorothie
; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.13

after dinner the Ladie desired to speake to mee in private;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.14

the effect of her discourse was of some dislikes shee toke against her
daughter, one of going out without her consent, which shee sayes shee
will not allow of, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.15

and sayes when she lived with her Mother in law shee never did so.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.16

Another thing was that shee was with her daughter Marie, wheruppon shee
told her if she came againe into her company shee would turne her out
of doores.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.17

Another was shee met one whom shee called brother; which I learned to
bee one of Mr. Hogbin's sonnes; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.18

shee sayes she hath so ratled her up for the premises that shee left
her to her crying refuge and that more then once or twice either.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,167.19

I see our daughter growes wearie at beeing there allreadie, but knowes
not, neither do <P_168> I, whether she will goe, or doe, nor what will
bee the issue of businesses beetwixt us.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.20

Only I am resolved shee shall never come againe to live with mee in
regard of her neglective demeanour toward us when shee thought herselfe
uppon the top of fortune's wheele.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.21

Sir Allan is not yet returned, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.22

but hath sent his Lady a letter filled with strange expressions , some of
love, some of Rebuke, some of I know not what; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.23

he tells her hee prayes God to amend them both.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.24

Hee quotes textes of scripture to her of wifes'dutie to bee
obedient to their Husbands, and more Text to that and other effects.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.25

Tells her that both of them have their Dalilahs, which shee disclaimes
absolutely, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.26

and vowes shee will never keepe company with anie man hee shall tell
her hee dislikes.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.27

The summe of what I can say is, they lived like cats and dogs
when they were together and clash at one another being absent.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.28

Concerning Mr. Kt I have onlie to say I have not seene him
since I came to London, and I wrote my mind to you in my last.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.29

Concerning Jo: Hobart his threats, I value them not,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.30

onlie I wish I had nothing to doe with him.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.31

And the Ladie's saying I made him pay for his wife's wedding apparell
is false.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.32

I am at least, one way or other, $400 $=ll= {TEXT:400=ll=} out of purse
for him.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.33

I would I could say otherwise.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.34

I have sent Mr. Barling's booke apart because if I had enclosed
itt among my letters they might otherwise, have hapned not to have
come till Saturday by the wagon; his booke beeing of some bulke.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.35

The water I brought downe of which I tooke 3 spoonefulls a morning,
now itt comes to bee paid for is 30 or $40 $=s= {TEXT:40=s=} the halfe
pint, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.36

for I thinke I had not above, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.37

but I will not bee brought to that price.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.38

Pray preserve what is left att home of itt.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.39

I have not yett seene Mr. Andrewes, Mr. Nedham nor
Mr. Thompson, nor dranke the value of a quart of wine since I
came last to towne.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.40

You may beeleive the Ile of man is taken, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,168.41

for since my <P_169> writing the 3 other sides I saw Mr. Nedham
who assures mee so much, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.42

and Limbrick is taken; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.43

my Lord President hath letters of itt which I saw.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.44

This is not for certaine in the bookes HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.45

but I assure it you.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.46

I heare also Jo: Hobbart is in Towne HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.47

and his wife and hee come together; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.48

they are both well met.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,169.49

I can say no more than what you shall find me whilst I live;

There is no newes in the Moonday Diurnall beeyond the King's being for
the most part in trees, after the fight at Worchester, one day and night,
and that the Lady <P_170> that went with him was so kind as not to forsake
him so long as hee stayd uppon the land.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.56

But this I shall tell thee is newes not yet in print,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.57

and itt is to bee wondered if itt should: viz that uppon Sunday last,
about 4 of the clock in the afternoone, Hind was taken after all his
Rambles at a Barber's house as hee was reading the bookes concerning him;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.58

being brought beefore the Lord President hee told him hee was a notorious
theife; to whom he answered hee was no Theife but only borrowed and had
an intention to pay every man his owne againe.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.59

This you may beleive; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.60

I meane the history; not that hee intends to pay every man:
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.61

but I beelieve hee will bee paid his due, viz a Halter.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.62

I have sent the Testament thou dist send to mee for and withall a
peeice of Taffety for a petticoat for thy selfe, for which I paid for
out of the 3=l= 6=s= 8=d= I receaved from old Denne, because I would
bee sure thou shouldst have somewhat out of it, come what there can.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.63

I have also bought my selfe a Bible in folio; wherein there is never
a word misprinted, which shall bee to the longest liver of us two;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.64

it cost: one pound: two shillings: sixpence.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.65

Kate pray if you can gett money lett my sonne have 12=l= to pay Mr.
Fanting because his day is past.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.66

I can ad no more now because the post is uppon going, then that I am thine
in all fortunes whether adverse or prosperous.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.67

No: 10: 1651.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.69

Tell Mr. Barling I will remember the letter booke hee certifyed
mee of: HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.70

the first I have sent.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,170.71

<heading:edcomment:CVI_HENRY_OXINDEN_TO_HIS_WIFE>

Deare Heart, No longer agoe then Sunday last there was such a falling
out beetweene my daughter Hobart and the Lady Zouch that our daughter
had packed up her thinges to bee gon, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.76

and had not I accidentally come downe to dinner thether <paren> not
so much for the dinner as to see how the squares went, yet I found
there a great rib of roast beife, boyled meate, a rabbot and one of her
great puddinges <$$paren>, I thinke my daughter had ruined her selfe;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.77

for had shee gon without the Lady and her $husband $'s {TEXT:husband's}
consent <paren> I meane Jack Hobart, for Sir Allan is not yet come
<$$paren> shee would not have bene allowed any maintenance by the Lawe,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.78

and I beeleive both the Lady and Jack Hobart would have been glad of
the occasion.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.79

The Lady and her sonne are both exceeding great one with the other;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.80

shee beeleives him a Saint; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.81

shee thinkes hee hath beene exceedingly wronged in reports,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,171.82

and <P_172> hee affirmes, and confirmed itt confidently beefore mee,
that hee brewed but one bushell of malt, which hee made out into drinke,
and that was all that caused so much report of the drinking in his house.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.83

The truth is shee keepes him exceedingly in awe, and very temperate.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.84

Shee talkes about going beeyond seas HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.85

and hee sayes hee will go with her and what not.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.86

The occasion of the falling out betweene the Lady and her daughter was
because shee went into her daughter Marie's company, contrary to her
commands and indeed contrary to mine allso; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.87

surely shee growes too too headstrong HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.88

and hath neede enough of such a one as the Lady to breake her if possible
of her willfull courses.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.89

My cozin Master is come to Towne, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.90

but Mr. Andrews and hee have not yet mett.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.91

I was this day at Westminster where I met Mr. Kt.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.92

He told mee hee intended to go home $in regard of this night.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.93

I desired him if hee saw you to remember my love to you
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.94

and that was all I said to him.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.95

If he will have Betty without standing upon a portion and rely uppon
us {COM:ms._torn} the businesse I would be glad to have only thee and
I and ours to live together.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.96

I am in haste Thine alone Hen: Oxinden HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.97

No: 24, 1651 HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.98

HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.99

This day they chuse members for the counsell of state
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.100

but itt is not yet knowne.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,172.101

Liuetenant Generall Fleetwood's Lady is now going to bee buried.

<P_173>

Deare Hearte, My sonne came up Saturday, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.105

from him I receaved thy letter; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.106

I am glad to heare thou art in health but sorrie thou art put to so hard
shiftes, as indeed I am the like.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.107

My sonne Thomas was yesterday at the Ladie Zouche's where hee understood
that uppon Saturday night last, that after Sir Allan and my Ladie were
in their bed, Harrie Hobart came up into their chamber, and the Ladie
beginning to finde fault with him for coming home so late hee thereuppon
drew out his sword and threatened to kill his Mother and tore downe the
Curtaines, insomuch that the Ladie fell into fitts of the Mother and
itt was thought she would have dyed; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.108

Sir Allan in the interim lay by HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.109

and sayd nothing; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.110

John Hobart coming up after Harry Hobart and thinking to pacifie him,
was in danger to be killed by his brother.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.111

Much was sayd and done more then I can now relate,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.112

but this {is} enough to shew in what a lamentable condition
they live, no place that I know resembling Hell so much as that;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.113

and indeed miserable are all they that have anie thing to doe with them.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.114

My Cozin Master desires to bee acquitted of Denton, not because hee
is out of love with itt, but because hee is afrayd of some incumbrance
uppon itt; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.115

this is all of these two thinges but too much to bee spoken of.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.116

I would to God I were once in a condition that I might not bee forced
in this manner to live from thee so long.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.117

I had rather enjoy a little then have much and bee deprived of thy
company.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.118

Pray aske my daughter Bettie from mee what shee can expect from mee,
being so refractory to my will.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.119

Tell her I intend shee shall not live long at home with mee and
therefore I would have her beethinke her selfe of a service.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.120

I told her my minde enough of this beefore; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.121

I thought I should not have needed to have beene put to the trouble to
say more of itt.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.122

There is little newes but that of the Act of Oblivion, which is about
coming out; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,173.123

but no Act shall ever make mee forgett <P_174> the respects I ow to thee

Deare Heart, I have sent my sonne home to keep thee companie because I
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} yett come myselfe, for greife wherof I kept my
bed all day yesterday.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.127

As concerning old Denne's businesse, my sonne can spare mee the paines
in relating itt to thee; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.128

sure I am as yett hee may wish hee had not meddled with opposition of
mee, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.129

for I have carried everie thing against him since I came to towne.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.130

Concerning my sonne, you have him now with you I assure you a single
though not a singular man: HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.131

how soone hee may be marred or married I knowe not.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.132

For my part, if I could have my price for land, I have a desire rather to
convert itt into mony then mar or marry him; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.133

if hee marry hee will hardly bee of a profession, which I value
equall to an estate att least of $100 $=ll= {TEXT:100=ll=} the yeare:
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.134

if he do not marrie well, I know not how I shall according to the saying
keepe buckle and thong together.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,174.135

Pray sift out to your utmost abilitie how they of Broome stand affected
to the buying of what I have formerly <P_175> acquainted you with;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.136

I do not value what was my forefathers if inconvenient to mee,
as they would have altered their estates if for their conveniency;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.137

they have left mee the same liberty HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.138

and I may lawfully take it; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.139

and Posterity will take the same libertie should I do my utmost to
prevent itt HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.140

and it is not wisdome as thinges may happen to have it otherwise.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.141

This is my opinion; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.142

however I shall be ruled, or rather overruled by thee, by
whose desires I shall stare my Course, so long as I find thee no
otherwise then I have done hetherto, that is Faithfull and Carefull.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.143

Trust no bodie's wordes nor present affections;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.144

they will fade according to interest and profitt.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.145

It is only that true love and true lover's knot beetwene man and wife
continues indissoluble; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.146

what is beesides it is a chance, if att the last itt end not in hatred
and discontent.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.147

Warily observe all negotiations beetweene Denton Court, Deane and Broome
; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.148

surely they have some thing or other in designe amongst them in
relation to Matches one amongst the other, or in regard of having
Denton Court, which I tell thee once for all I beeleive at St.
Mich. Mr. Andrewes will have in his owne possession.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.149

If Mr. Andrews would have assured the 1500=ll= I formerly
acquainted thee with, I beleive hee and I might have concluded on
somewhat, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.150

but, in regard of mistakes beetweene us, the issue of that, as of most
of my affaires, is uncertaine.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.151

I beeleive my Cozin Ja: Master hath no present Mistris at London and
therfore is to seeke one to come; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.152

his friends say hee hath no mind to marrie, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.153

but that saying of theirs is like to that of maydes, who say they care
not to marrie, which is to bee understood till they can gett them wifes.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.154

I beeleve his friends have bene these 3 or 4. yeares about the
designe of getting him a rich Match, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.155

and when they $can $not {TEXT:cannot}, perhaps they will have that in
designe nere home; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.156

if so, you may if you have oportunity see how cunningly they all play
their games; which you may the better do if you seeme to take no notice
of anything concerning them.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,175.157

<P_176>

Deare Heart,
{COM:15_lines,_substance_elsewhere_repeated,_omitted_in_edition} When
you see the partie that sifts whether I intend to put off land suddenly
or no?  order your discourse to this effect with her: viz: you know itt
is my intention so to doe, and that I seldome go about anything that
is feaceable but that I do one way or other effect it , and that my way
is <paren> as much as the nature of the businesse requires <$$paren> to
doe a thing first, and then, and not before, to speake of itt, though in
other cases I may bee free enough of my speech; that you know I had rather
they would have dealt with mee then another, and when itt is too late,
they will as long as they live repent of their not dealing with mee.
That it is to bee wondred that they beeing so understanding as they are
should bee so overseene as to lett slip any oportunity of having land nere
them when they may ; itt being of so much concernement to their quiett.
That to suffer another neighbour to encroach nere upon them is against all
the pollicy in the world.  That whereas perhaps they have omitted other
things nere home in expectation of Denton Court, and may do so still,
tell them , that Denton Court is not so convenient for them as other
thinges; that itt is not likely to bee had; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,176.159

if itt were likely, divers casualities in itt, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,176.160

and when all comes to all, any friend of the heires may redeeme itt att
his coming to age that will deposite as much as hee that is to buy itt;

accordingly: HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,176.163

<heading:edcomment:CIX_HENRY_OXINDEN_TO_KATHERINE_OXINDEN>

Deare Heart, {COM:27_lines_omitted} Concerning the gentleman
you understand well of, I have seene him sometimes since,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,177.168

but wee are att {TEXT:att_at} greater distance then formerly;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,177.169

the reason I conceave to bee because uppon that last discourse uppon which
wee estranged ourselves I told him I understood hee promised 1500=ll=
but hee proffered then not above 1000=ll=, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,177.170

and I beeleive hee understood by mee my estate was not so much cleere,
debts payd, as hee expected.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,177.171

However wee apprehended one the other <P_178> then I know not certainlie
; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.172

nor know not what hee intends now; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.173

but if hee will lett mee enioy a cleere estate to the value of as I
have told thee formerly in discourse beetweene thee and I, and with
the monie I shall receave of him and the sale of land pay what I owe ,
I shall thinke it as thinges stand with mee <paren> accounting the nature
of the man, his neerenes in neighbourhood, and relation to us, <$$paren>
the best I can make HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.174

for I know not of anie other match, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.175

and if I did, I much scruple the issue of itt.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.176

If I can bee left free, if thou wilt, I will venture;
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.177

and if thou likest I should, I shall desire thee to animate my sonne in
relation to itt; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.178

tell him if I chance to happen in trouble beefore hee marrie, he can
not then expect any match att all.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.179

I expected to have gotten monie HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.180

and then I intended to have bought a golden watch for him to have
presented his once perhaps intended M=s= with, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.181

but having itt not, I should not lett thee suffer for the curtesie if
thou wouldst send mee the ring of diamonds with which his mother was
married with, and which shee delivered mee a little before her death,
with desire hee might have itt, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.182

but I will promise thee hee shall not have itt otherwise then uppon the
occasion of gaining what wee expect thereby; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.183

otherwise I will see itt in thy possession againe.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.184

Doe as thou pleasest; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.185

I know thou hast itt in pawne of mee for somewhat or other I have
forgotten, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.186

but what ever it bee I will, if God inable mee, bee as good as my word
to thee who art liveing; as well as to the dead, who know nothing <paren>
as I suppose <$$paren> of my actions.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.187

If thou send it by my sonne to mee, lett not him know what I intend with
itt; HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.188

the safest way to carrie itt will bee <paren> as I thinke <$$paren>
to sow itt up in the bellie peece of his dublett, or otherwise as thou
mayst thinke more safely.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.189

Let mee entreate thee not to take this desire of mine amisse, meere
necessitie occasioning mee to request this att thy hands; but not so
earnestly as that I shall faile in my love to thee in case of denyall.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,178.190

I have sent thee somewhat which I bee chance hapned uppon to make a
window cushion, or the like, which I desire thee to accept of and to
give itt after our decease to which of our children thou thinkest <P_179>
best of: HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.191

itt will serve to healp sett out our house when thee and I are alone of
our selves.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.192

For my part I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} beeleive there is anie hurt in
pictures: so long as wee do not worship the shadow and forgett the
substance.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.193

I am sorrie my sonne loves his booke no better, it is hee will repent
itt hereafter; but more sorrie thou hadst beene ill if I had not heard
of thy recoverie, for which I praise God.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.194

Mr. Andrews doth intend to come and live att Denton att St.
Mich, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.195

and if the businesse goe forward beetweene him and mee, hee may buy that
I must putt off, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.196

and then the businesse will in my opinion bee the lesse.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.197

I can say nothing for certaine, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.198

and as therefore as thou sayest I must refer all thinges to Him whose
will <paren> whatever mine bee <$$paren> will bee done, I shall for my
part respect thy Councell as far as I can.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.199

I have beene but once at Sir Thomas Peyton's since hee came to Westminster
which was uppon Saturday last, at which time his sonne was in some danger
of life, but perhaps amended since, HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.200

for I heard Sir Tho: was att the Globe in Fleet street uppon Mooneday
last.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.201

I heard at Sir Tho: Peyton's that one Smith, one of the principall Hectors
in the towne, is latelie dead, and his brother Hectors complaine that hee
hath made no provision for them etc. HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.202

Ned Swan cheeres himselfe up in expectation of future happinesse,
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.203

and wonders to see mee so melancholy as hee often tells mee.
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.204

I must confess there is a great deale of happinesse in expectation of
good: HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.205

but I expect but little.  HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.206

The best I hope for is to live lovingly and quietly with thee and to
bee content with whatsoever itt shall please God to lay out for mee:
HOXINDEN-1650-E3-P2,179.207

and shall ever remaine Thine and solely thine Hen: Oxinden
