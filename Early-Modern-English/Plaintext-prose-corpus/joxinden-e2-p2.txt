Deere Brother, I know the vehement desire and the exceeding greate
care which you have of my welfare listeneth to heare some news of the
schollar's place, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,71.5

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} write any certainty to you concerning it, by
reason that there is soe many that stand for it, to wit 9 , that I allmost
feare of the obtaining it, but still am in hope JOXINDEN-E2-P2,71.6

and in the meane time noe way shall be left untried by me.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,71.7

Mr. Holt did greatly desire to have seene <P_72> you at the
commencement, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.8

and did tell me that if you your selfe were present it would goe better
with me concerning the schollar's place.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.9

But I suppose your great busines in other affaires would not suffer you
to come.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.10

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} write to you when the Election will be as yet
, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.11

for it is at the Presedent's appointing JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.12

and about a weeke hence he goes a progress into his Contry,
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.13

and then I beleive, if it be not before his going, that it will not be
this 8 weekes, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.14

and then I think I must retire agane to Cambridg.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.15

I hope you arre all in good health.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.16

I desire you to remember my Duty to my Mother, my love to my Sisters.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.17

I will not at this time troble you with many lines nor hinder my more
carefull study in writing many lines; JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.18

leaving noe way untried, and as the proverb omnem movebo lapidem to the
obtaining of it, I rest Your Loving Brother James Oxinden From C.C.C.
in Oxford JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.19

I pray you, if you can conveniently, that you would not let the church
book be seene, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.20

but keepe it in the house, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.21

or else order the Figures according to the writing that was sent up by
Good. Coper.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,72.22

Dearest Brother, That misfortune of losing the Scholler's place makes
me allmost affraid to write unto you, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.25

but I hope that you having heard <paren> i doubt not <$$paren> that it was
not any defect of me, you will have me pardoned soe that my letters may
have free access and accepted as they were before; JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.26

having the opertunyty of this carrier and being now allmost as they say
ita pauperior for want of money by reason that I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
heare from you, I therefor now intreate you to send me my quarteridge.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.27

But me thinks I heare you wonder how it should come to pass that I
should want money soe sone, having received some from you soe lately:
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.28

but I hope the letter which I sent you by my Cosine Pettet will expel
that doubt out of your mind: wherefor I intreate you to be soe loving as
you have always beene, and in this necessity to set to your helping hand,
and this time not to deny.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.29

And you shal not heare from me againe till next quarter.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.30

Thus in hope of your favour I goe forward, desiring you all soe that you
would desire my Mother to send me some bands and Cufts and Hanchechers
and 2 or 3 towells, which were promised me the last returne of the
Carrier JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.31

and now I hope I shall not miss of them, in which hope, being in greate
haste, remembring my love to you, my duty unto my Mother I rest Your
ever loving Brother James Oxinden JOXINDEN-E2-P2,73.32

Most Loving Brother, I receiving my Mother's letter, though indeede
that needed not for my accusation in writing so peromtorily unto you,
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,92.37

for myself after serious consultation is a sufficient iudg to condemn
mee of my folly, of which I am now <paren> O si praeteritos recovet
mihi Jupiter annos <$$paren> hartilie <paren> i feare too late <$$paren>
sorie for it: JOXINDEN-E2-P2,92.38

my necessitie I confess was very urgent, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,92.39

and it was it seemes the carriar's fault to detain it from mee soe
long, which hath <paren> i feare <$$paren> incurred your more sevearer
displeasure.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,92.40

<P_93>

But I hope your better iudgment weighing how prowne youth is uppon the
smallest occasion to interpret the worst, you will pardon this crime,
which if teares can expiat, Perlegis et lachrymas finge videre meas.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.42

$'T $is {TEXT:T'is} true I have scarse that mask of Impudence <paren>
having so grosslie offended you <$$paren> as to seeme to excuse my fault ,
being soe great, untill I considder the tendernes of your nature, which
is soe apt to forgive; JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.43

I with confidence here unlock myselfe unto you, desiring once more to
bee ingrafted into your favour, which if I shall obtain I shall pose
Arethmatick in giving thanks unto you and shall think you the sole
Brother of humanity.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.44

My request unto you is that you would send mee my Quarteridge:
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.45

for I must needes make mee a sute of Clothes before the commencement.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.46

I think it doth not want above a weeke of a Quarter since I had my
last Quarteridg.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.47

I received it the 12th of March JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.48

and now it is the 27th of may.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.49

I am sure by that time I shall receive it the time will bee full expird.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.50

In the meane time I doubt not of your Brotherly care and your indulgent
affection toward mee, which as it hath allways beene soe, it will now
bee reddy to healp mee in my necessity.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.51

I know that my Brothers'urgent occasions hath allmost suckt you dry of
money JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.52

and therefore I would not, were I not forct, trouble you,
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,93.53

desiring to bee remembred both to you and your loving Bedfellow I reste

Loving Brother, I may, and that justly, think humanity to have been exil'd
or have beene devorct from all hearts were shee not lodged in yours ,
whom excluding all others I may call the sole borne sonne of humanity ,
whose curtisie swift winged time, having lost soe many feathers, is to
poore to furnish me with dayes enough to express my service unto you
and Arethmatick is to poore to multiplie thanks enough for your former
curtesies.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.60

But to omit the idle heaping up of words which arre to frivilous to
trouble your more serious occasions, as in all things I desire to
satissfie your desires, soe I am desirous to acquaint you with my
acourrants in Cambridg; JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.61

my Scholler's place <paren> though with great difficulty <$$paren> I doe
retain, by reason some envious people, more for envy then any hopes to
obtaine it, would needes attempt it, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.62

but the master of our Colleidg and some other of my freinds, accepting
my excuses, would not deprive mee of it.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.63

My Chamber I have lost JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.64

and can not heare of Mr. Bletchinden, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.65

myself, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,95.66

Dearest Brother, I am verry sorry that I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} soe much
recover my strength as to give you thanks for your most loving letter.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.73

I am though feebly, thanks bee to God, somewhat $recovered from the poison
of sickness, which though I am I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say freed from,
yet so much as to write unto you, which I never $thought to have had
that happines.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.74

You write unto mee to certifie you whether I bee Master of Arts or noe,
which I was not at the receit of your letter, being then not the Time
of our commensement, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.75

but now, Thanks bee to God, I have obtained it.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.76

Good Brother, send mee word if the least preferment may bee had,
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.77

for I am not able nor willing, considring my greate Sicknes, to remaine
heere.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.78

I would <paren> as the Proverb sayth <$$paren> play at small game wrather
then give out, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.79

and my sicknes hath soe disinabled mee that I feare to live in this
infectious ayre.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.80

You write to mee to send you a note of the receite of monyes,
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.81

but the extraordinary resistance of my occasions and the greeviousness
of my sicknes detaines mee from it.  JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.82

I must <paren> Brother <$$paren> desire you uppon all love to send mee
by the bearer the sum of 10=ll=, which I have impulsive necessity to use.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.83

I must buy mee a Master of Arts Gowne and a sute, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.84

beesides I am indebted for my commensement and my sicknes.
JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.85

Let not <paren> I pray you <$$paren> my not forceable writing unto you
make you weake in sending to me, JOXINDEN-E2-P2,113.86

for I <P_114> protest I have had soe much bloud taken from mee that I
