<P_1,205>

About this time the <font> Rajah <$$font>, according to the <font> Hindu
<$$font> Custom, was weighed in Gold, and poised about 16000 Pagods,
which Money, together with an 100000 more is to be distributed among
the <font> Brachmines <$$font> after the day <P_1,206> he is enthroned,
who in great numbers flock hither from all parts of his Territories.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.2

Being earnest to press on his Errand he came for, the Ambassador sent
to <font> Narun Gi Pundit <$$font> to know what was transacted in the
Articles; FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.3

but was returned for Answer.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.4

The <font> Rajah <$$font> stopt his Ears to all Affairs, declaring he
had granted all the Demands, except those two Articles, expressing,
Our Money shall go current in his Dominions, and his on <font> Bombaim
<$$font>; and that he shall restore whatever Wrecks may happen on his
Coasts belonging to the <font> English <$$font>, and Inhabitants of <font>
Bombaim <$$font>: FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.5

The first he accounted unnecessary to be inserted, because he forbids
not the passing of any manner of Coins; FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.6

nor on the other side, can he force his Subjects to take those Monies
whereby they shall be Losers; FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.7

but if our Coin be as fine an Allay, and as weighty as the <font> Mogul's
<$$font>, and other Princes, he will not prohibit it.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,206.8

To the other he says, that it is against the Laws of <font> Conchon
<$$font> to restore any Ships, Vessels, or Goods, that are driven
ashore by <P_1,207> Tempest, or otherwise; and that should he grant
us that Privilege, the <font> French <$$font>, <font> Dutch <$$font>
, and other Merchants, would claim the same Right; which he could not
grant without breaking a Custom has lasted many Ages: FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.9

The rest of our Desires he willingly conceded, embracing with much
satisfaction our Friendship, promising to himself and Country much
Happiness by our Settlement and Trade: FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.10

Notwithstanding <font> Narun Gi Pundit <$$font> did not altogether
despair of obtaining our Wrecks, because we enjoyed the same Privilege
in the <font> Mogul <$$font>, and <font> Duccan <$$font> Country.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.11

Near a Month after they had been here, <font> Narun Gi Pundit <$$font>
sent word, That to Morrow about Seven or Eight in the Morning, the <font>
Rajah Seva Gi <$$font> intended to ascend his Throne; and he would take
it kindly if they came to congratulate him thereon; that it was necessary
to present him with some small thing, it not being the Custom of the
<font> Eastern <$$font> Parts to appear before a Prince empty-handed.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.12

The Ambassador sent him word, according to his Advice he would wait on
the <font> Rajah <$$font> at the prescribed time.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.13

Accordingly next Morning he and his Retinue went to Court,
FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.14

and found the <font> Rajah <$$font> seated on a Magnificent Throne,
and all his Nobles waiting on him in Rich Attire; his Son <font> Samba
Gi Rajah <$$font>, <font> Peshuah Mora Pundit <$$font>, and a <font>
Brachmin <$$font> of Great Eminence, seated on an Ascent under the
Throne; the rest, as well Officers of the Army as others, standing with
great Respect.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.15

The <font> English <$$font> made their Obeisance at a distance,
FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.16

and <font> Narun Sinai <$$font> held up the Diamond Ring that was to be
presented him: FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.17

He presently took notice of it, FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.18

and ordered their coming nearer, even to the Foot of the Throne, where
being Vested, they were desired to retire; which they did not so soon,
FRYER-E3-P2,1,207.19

but they took notice on each side of the Throne there hung <paren>
according to the <font> Moors <$$font> manner <$$paren> on heads <P_1,208>
of Gilded Launces many Emblems of Dominion and Government; as on the
Right-hand were two great Fishes Heads of Gold, with very large Teeth;
on the Left, several Horses Tails, a Pair of Gold Scales on a very high
Launce's head, equally poized, an Emblem of Justice; FRYER-E3-P2,1,208.20

and as they returned, at the Palace Gate stood two small Elephants on
each side, and two fair Horses with Gold Trappings, Bridles, and Rich
Furniture; which made them admire how they brought them up the Hill,
the Passage being both difficult and hazardous.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,208.21

Two days after this, the <font> Rajah <$$font> was married to a Fourth
Wife, without State; FRYER-E3-P2,1,208.22

and doth every day bestow Alms on the <font> Brachmins <$$font>.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,208.23

Some days after, <font> Narun Gi Pundit <$$font> sent word the <font>
Rajah <$$font> had signed their Articles, all but that about Money.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,208.24

Then the rest of the Ministers of State signed them, FRYER-E3-P2,1,208.25

and they went to receive them of <font> Narun Gi Pundit <$$font>,
<P_1,209> who delivered them to the Ambassador with Expressions of great
Kindness for our Nation, and offered on all occasions to be serviceable
to the <font> English <$$font> at the Court of the <font> Rajah <$$font>.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.26

I will only add one Passage during the Stay of our Ambassador at <font>
Rairee <$$font>: FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.27

The Diet of this sort of People admits not of great Variety or Cost,
their delightfullest Food being only <font> Cutchery <$$font>, a sort
of Pulse and Rice mixed together, and boiled in Butter, with which they
grow Fat: FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.28

but such Victuals could not be long pleasing to our Merchants, who had
been used to Feed on good Flesh: FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.29

It was therefore signified to the <font> Rajah <$$font>, That Meat should
be provided for them; FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.30

and to that end a Butcher that served those few <font> Moors <$$font>
that were there, that were able to go to the Charge of Meat, was ordered
to supply them with what Goat they should expend <paren> nothing else
here being to be gotten for them <$$paren>, which he did accordingly,
to the consumption of half a Goat a Day, which he found very profitable
for him, FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.31

and thereupon was taken with a Curiosity to visit his new Customers;
to whom, when he came, it was told them, The honest Butcher had made an
Adventure up the Hill, though very old, to have the sight of his good
Masters, who had taken off of his hands more Flesh in that time they
had been there than he had sold in some Years before; so rare a thing
is it to eat Flesh among them; FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.32

for the <font> Gentiles <$$font> eat none, FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.33

and the <font> Moors <$$font> and <font> Portugals <$$font> eat it well
stew'd, bak'd, or made into Pottage; no Nation eating it roasted so
commonly as we do: FRYER-E3-P2,1,209.34

And in this point I doubt we <P_1,210> err in these Hot Countries,
where our Spirits being always upon the Flight, are not so intent on the
business of Concoction; so that those things that are easiest digested,
and that create the least trouble to the Stomach, we find by Experience
to agree best here.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,210.35

CHAP. V.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,210.37

<font> Our Passage to <$$font> Swally, <font> and Relation of the <$$font>
English <font> Presidency at <$$font> Surat.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,210.38

<$$heading>

After the Rains were over, and the <font> North-East <$$font> Wind had
brought in the Cool Season, by Command from the President I was sent to
<font> Surat <$$font>.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,210.40

In a Week's time we turned it up, sailing by <font> Bac~ein <$$font>,
<font> Tarapore <$$font>, <font> Valentine's-Peak <$$font>, St.
<font> John's <$$font>, and <font> Daman <$$font>, the last City
Northward on the Continent, belonging to the <font> Portugueze <$$font>.
As also passing by <font> Balsore <$$font> <paren> the first Town of
the <font> Moors <$$font> Southward of <font> Surat <$$font> <$$paren>
FRYER-E3-P2,1,210.41

and eight Ships riding at <font> Surat <$$font> River's Mouth,
FRYER-E3-P2,1,210.42

we then came to <font> Swally Marine <$$font>, where were flying the
several Colours of the Three Nations, <font> English <$$font>, <font>
French <$$font>, and <font> Dutch <$$font>, on Flag-Staffs <P_1,211>
erected for that purpose, who here land and ship off all Goods, without
molestation.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.43

Here we were welcomed by the Deputy-President, Mr. <font> Matthew
Grey <$$font>, an Eminent Merchant, and by the rest of the Council,
who took care for my Entertainment, which here was but rude, the place
admitting of little better Tenements than Booths, stiled by the name of
<font> Choultries <$$font>: FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.44

Before President <font> Andrew's <$$font> time they always lodged in
Tents; FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.45

but since, Wooden Houses tiled with Pan-Tiles have been raised in an
Inclosure allotted by the Governor.  In which Compound are included
Warehouses, Stables, and other Out-houses, with as good a Garden as this
Sandy Soil will allow; in which ours exceeds the other two, being far
pleasanter seated.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.46

To this place belong two sorts of Vermin, the Fleas and <font> Banyans
<$$font>; FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.47

the one harbouring in the Sand, fasten upon you as you pass; where $'t
$is {TEXT:'tis} some Pastime to see what Shift the <font> Banyan <$$font>
makes, being bit by them, FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.48

he dare not kill them, for fear of unhousing a Soul, according to their
Notion of Transmigration; FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.49

but giving them a severe Pinch will put them to shift for themselves in
a Nest of Cotton-Wool.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,211.50

The other Vermin are the <font> Banyans <$$font> <P_1,212> themselves
, that hang like Horse-leeches, till they have suck'd both <font>
Sanguinem & Succum <$$font> <paren> I mean Mony <$$paren> from you:
FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.51

As soon as you have set your Foot on Shore, they crowd in their Service,
interposing between you and all Civil Respect, as if you had no other
Business but to be gull'd; so that unless you have some to make your way
through them, they will interrupt your going, and never leave till they
have drawn out something for their Advantage.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.52

At this time of Shipping they Present the Governor of <font> Surat
<$$font>, to license them to keep a Mart here, which they make the <font>
Europeans <$$font> pay dearly for: FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.53

Yet such is their Policy, that without these, neither you nor the Natives
themselves shall do any Business, though they are worse Brokers than
<font> Jews <$$font>; if they be not the Spawn of them, the <font>
Rechabites <$$font>, that would drink no Wine.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.54

These generally are the Poorer sort, and set on by the Richer to Trade
with the Seamen for the meanest things they bring; FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.55

and notwithstanding they take them at their own rates, get well enough
in exchange of Goods with them.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.56

They are the absolute Map of Sordidness, fareing hardly, and professing
fairly, to entrap the unwary; enduring servily foul Words, Affronts and
Injuries, for a future hope of Gain; expert in all the studied arts
of Thriving and Insinuation; so that, Lying, Dissembling, Cheating,
are their Masterpiece: FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.57

Their whole desire is to have Money pass through their Fingers, to which
a great part is sure to stick: FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.58

For they well understand the constant turning of Cash amounts both to
the Credit and Profit of him that is so occupied; which these <font>
Banyans <$$font> are sensible of, FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.59

otherwise they would not be so industrious to enslave themselves.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,212.60

Having viewed the Tombs by the Sea-side, and some more conspicuous at
the end of the Plain belonging to the <font> English <$$font>; others
seated behind the <font> Dutch Choultry <$$font>, <P_1,213> partly <font>
English <$$font>, partly <font> Dutch <$$font>: Marks set to avoid, as
well the <font> Sylla <$$font> and <font> Charibdis <$$font> of <font>
Damkin <$$font> and <font> Mora <$$font>, two Nurseries for Stews, as
to warn them of the Sands coming into the Hole where the Ships ride at
Anchor very securely: We in the Company's Coaches Travelled to <font>
Surat <$$font>, Ten Mile, brave Champion ground; FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.61

but the Coach wherein I was, breaking, we were forced to mount the
<font> Indian Hackery <$$font>, a Two-wheeled Chariot, drawn by swift
little Oxen.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.62

By Sun-set we entred the Company's Barge, waiting to carry us over
the River; where saluted us the dreadful Noise of the <font> Moors
<$$font> Drums and Trumpets, it being customary for them to sound at
the Castle every Three hours; but chiefly at Sun-rise and Sun-set:
FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.63

I could think of nothing but the last Trump; so that I could persuade
my self there was little Musick in it; FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.64

but they say Time will bring it to be agreeable to the Ears.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.65

On the other side the River, other Four wheeled Coaches expected us,
FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.66

and the <font> Moors <$$font> let us pass the Custom-house without
Examination, having Women among us; which was no ordinary point of
Civility, they otherwise being strict Examiners, unless the President
cross the River, when they forbear also.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,213.67

The Coach where the Women were, was covered with <P_1,214> <font> Cheeks
<$$font>, a sort of hanging Curtain, made with Bents variously Coloured
with Lacker, and Chequered with Packthred so artificially, that you may
see all without, and your self within unperceived: FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.68

Ours was open, and guarded by such a Troop as went to apprehend
our Saviour, dressed after the same manner we find them on old
Landskips, and led by the same Phanatick Lights we see there Painted.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.69

Our Reception at the <font> English <$$font> House was Courteous and
Welcome, FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.70

for the Heat of the Day had tired us.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.71

The House the <font> English <$$font> live in at <font> Surat <$$font>,
is partly the King's Gift, partly hired; Built of Stone and excellent
Timber, with good Carving, without Representations; very strong, for that
each Floor is Half a Yard thick at least, of the best plastered Cement,
which is very weighty.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.72

It is contrived after the <font> Moor's <$$font> Buildings, with upper
and lower Galleries, or Terras-walks; a neat Oratory, a convenient open
Place for Meals.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.73

The President has spacious Lodgings, noble Rooms for Counsel and
Entertainment, pleasant Tanks, Yards, and an Hummum to Wash in; but no
Gardens in the City, or very few, though without they have many, like
Wildernesses, overspread with Trees.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.74

The <font> English <$$font> had a neat one, FRYER-E3-P2,1,214.75

but <font> Seva Gi's <$$font> coming, <P_1,215> destroyed it:
FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.76

It is known, as the other Factories are, by their several Flags flying.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.77

Here they live <paren> in Shipping-time <$$paren> in a continual
hurlyburly, the <font> Banyans <$$font> presenting themselves from the
hour of Ten till Noon; and then Afternoon at Four till Night, as if it
were an Exchange in every Row; FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.78

below stairs, the Packers and Warehouse-keepers, together with Merchants
bringing and receiving Musters, make a meer <font> Billinsgate <$$font>
; FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.79

for if you make not a Noise, they hardly think you intent on what you
are doing.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.80

Among the <font> English <$$font>, the Business is distributed into four
Offices; FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.81

the Accomptant, who is next in Dignity to the President, the general
Accompts of all <font> India <$$font>, as well as this place, passing
through his hands; he is <font> Quasi <$$font> Treasurer, signing all
things, though the Broker keep the Cash.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.82

Next him is the Warehouse-keeper, who registers all <font> Europe <$$font>
Goods Vended, and receives all <font> Eastern <$$font> Commodities Bought;
FRYER-E3-P2,1,215.83

under him is the Purser Marine, who gives Account of all Goods
Exported and Imported, pays Seamen their Wages, provides Waggons and
Porters, looks <P_1,216> after Tackling for Ships, and Ships Stores.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.84

Last of all is the Secretary, who models all Consultations, writes all
Letters, carries them to the President and Council to be perused and
signed; keeps the Company's Seal, which is affixed to all Passes and
Commissions; records all Transactions, and sends Copies of them to the
Company; though none of these, without the President's Approbation,
can act or do any thing.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.85

The Affairs of <font> India <$$font> are solely under his Regulation;
FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.86

from him issue out all Orders, FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.87

by him all Preferment is disposed; by which means the Council are biassed
by his Arbitrament.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.88

The whole Mass of the Company's Servants may be comprehended in these
Classes, <font> viz. <$$font> Merchants, Factors, and Writers ;
FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.89

some Blewcoat Boys also have been entertained under Notion of Apprentices
for Seven Years, which being expired, if they can get Security, they
are capable of Employments.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.90

The Writers are obliged to serve Five Years for 10 <font> l. per
Ann. <$$font> giving in Bond of 500 <font> l. <$$font>
for good Behaviour, all which time they serve under some of the
forementioned Offices: After which they commence Factors, and rise to
Preferment and Trust, according to Seniority or Favour, and therefore
have a 1000 <font> l. <$$font> Bond exacted from them, and have
their Salary augmented to 20 <font> l. per Ann. <$$font>
for Three Years, FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.91

then entring into new Indentures, are made Senior Factors; and lastly
, Merchants after Three Years more; out of whom are chose Chiefs of
Factories, as Places fall, and are allowed 40 <font> l. per
Ann. <$$font> during their stay in the Company's service, besides
Lodgings and Victuals at the Company's Charges.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.92

These in their several Seigniories behave themselves after the
Fundamentals of <font> Surat <$$font>, FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.93

and in their respective Factories live in the like Grandeur; from whence
they rise successively to be of the Council in <font> Surat <$$font>,
which is the great Council; FRYER-E3-P2,1,216.94

and if the President do not contradict, <P_1,217> are Sworn,
FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.95

and take their place accordingly, FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.96

which consists of about Five in Number, besides the President, to be
constantly Resident.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.97

As for the Presidency, though the Company seldom interpose a deserving
Man, yet they keep that Power to themselves, none assuming that Dignity
till confirmed by them: FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.98

His Salary from the Company is 500 <font> l. <$$font> a Year;
half paid here, the other half reserved to be received at home, in case
of misdemeanour, to make satisfaction; beside a Bond of 5000 <font>
l. Sterling <$$font> of good Securities.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.99

The Accountant has 72 <font> l. per Annum <$$font>, Fifty Pound
paid here, the other at home: FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.100

All the rest are half paid here, half paid at home, except the Writers,
who have all paid here.  FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.101

Out of the Council are elected the Deputy-Governor of <font> Bombaim
<$$font>, and Agent of <font> Persia <$$font>; the first a Place of great
Trust, the other of Profit; though, by the appointment from the Company,
the second of <font> India <$$font> claims <font> Bombaim <$$font>,
and the Secretary of <font> Surat <$$font> the Agency of <font>
Persia <$$font>, which is connived at, and made subject to the Will
of the President, by the Interest of those whose Lot they are; chusing
rather to reside here, where Consignments compensate those Emoluments;
so that none of the Council, if noted in <font> England <$$font>, but
makes considerably by his Place, after the rate of Five in the Hundred,
Commission; FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.102

and this is the <font> Jacob's <$$font> Ladder, by which they ascend.
FRYER-E3-P2,1,217.103

<P_2,200>

From <font> Bonaru <$$font> to <font> Mousar <$$font>, another
Eight-square <font> Caravan <$$font>, are Fifteen Miles, fine, plain,
and easy way; FRYER-E3-P2,2,200.105

near the <font> Caravan Ser Raw <$$font> was a pleasant Garden, the
utmost extent of the <font> Caun <$$font> of <font> Lhor's <$$font>
Dominions on this Road.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,200.106

And as a Boundary thereto, is opposed the steepest Hill we have yet
met with, insomuch that we found it a notable Task to gain the Top by
the Morning of the following Day, contenting our selves to sit down at
<font> Chawtalk <$$font>, but Nine Miles from <font> Bonaru <$$font>
, being advised of a more troublesome Day's Journy the <font> Munsel
<$$font> after this; not so difficult for Access as this, but a more
continued Labour by the multitude of Mountains we were to Master,
FRYER-E3-P2,2,200.107

<P_2,201>

and on that account it was highly necessary to Feed our <font> Caphala's
<$$font> well before we undertake so great a Work.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.109

<font> Chawtalk <$$font>, <paren> by the most valuable Munificence of
the Benefactor, yet living to Oversee this good Deed compleated <$$paren>
is a noble new <font> Caravan <$$font>, an Ample and Princely Building :
FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.110

Near to it was, not long since, only a Well of Bitter Water, which gives
Name to the Place; FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.111

but by Cost and Inquest of this Pious Benefactor, Sweeter Waters are at
this time produced, something more remote, for Men to Drink, though the
Cattel refuse not generally the other.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.112

On these Mountains the <font> Mastich <$$font> Tree brings forth
plenty of that Gum, of which the Country People make good Profit:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.113

Nor does less Benefit accrue by the Mellifluous Dew a-Nights turn'd into
Manna, from the Leafs and Shrubs, as well as Plants, upon the sides of
these Mountains, which are not altogether so Barren as those we have
hitherto passed; FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.114

this Manna is White and Granulated, FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.115

and, what I have found my self, I think not inferior to the <font>
Calabrian <$$font>.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.116

As for the Mastick Trees, they bore Red Berries, FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.117

and if wounded would spew out the liquid Resin from the Branches;
FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.118

they are not very tall, of the bigness of our Bully Trees:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,201.119

Whether they bring forth a Cod or not, this <P_2,202> Season would not
inform me, FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.120

nor can I say it agrees in all respects with the Lentisk Tree of <font>
Clusius <$$font>.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.121

Here also grows the Wild or Bitter Almond, the Wands or Sticks of which
are in Esteem, for that Tradition of their being of the same Tree with
those of <font> Aaron's <$$font> Rod which budding brought forth Almonds
, and for that reason are worn by those of the highest Rank among them:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.122

More of this anon.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.123

And now the time approaches we must pass over in one Day as many
Mountains as we have hitherto been conquering, some of whose Clifts
could never be gained, had they not been joined together by vast Arches
from Rock to Rock, their dismal Pits otherwise being rendred impassable:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.124

Thus by inexpressible Endeavours we strive to clear this formidable
Chain of Hills, all in the Heat of the Sun <paren> not daring to trust
our selves in the Night <$$paren>, whereby we had our Skins flead off
of those Parts exposed to the Solar Rays; FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.125

and those that fared best had Bladders raised, as if scalded or burnt
by the Fire; for which, when we had travell'd One and twenty Miles,
we found at <font> Gerom <$$font> a ready Medicine of the Butter of the
Seed of Gourds made into an Ointment, which appeased the Inflammation
by its cooling Virtue, FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.126

and immediately asswaged the Pain by Basting our selves herewith, being
half Roasted.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.127

We refreshed our selves one entire Day at <font> Gerom <$$font>, where
a small White Grape, without any Stone, was an excellent Cordial;
FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.128

the Wine pressed from it is white also, and the strongest by Natural
Fermentation only, that I ever drank; FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.129

they are called <font> Kismas <$$font> Grapes, FRYER-E3-P2,2,202.130

and the <P_2,203> Wine is known by the same Name farther than where
they grow, it being of so stout a Body that it is not subject to decay
presently; though their best Wines when they begin to turn, are fit
for nothing but Vinegar, they being inexpert either in their Cure,
or to preserve them; FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.131

that which we drink is pure, without any Sophistication.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.132

There grow no where better Dates than at this Town; FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.133

and packed up dry are preferred before others all the World over.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.134

The People that dwell here are for the most part blind;
FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.135

for of Three you meet, Two shall not see, FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.136

and it may be a Third shall have but half an Eye.  The Occasion whereof,
as they report, is, because little pretty coloured Mice and Weasels by
their poysonous Stale infect the Trees so, that they produce Worms, the
Parent of this Distemper; more truly fancying than proving this Secret ,
for want of that Microscope whereby <font> Kepler <$$font> assisted this
enquiring Age to discover, That no kind of Plant whatsoever but procreates
of its superfluous juice some putrid Humour, which by active Nature is
enliven'd into Vital Motion, forming to every one their proper Insects.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,203.137

Whether any Virulency may be ascribed to these, or the immoderate eating
of Dates ought to be accused of their excessive Heat, as we do Wormwood
, which for that reason we account offensive to the Eyes, I know not
; following herein the Prince of Physicians, <font> Calidis enim qui
saepe multumque utuntur, nervorum infirmitatem adferunt, <P_2,204> in
Aph. <$$font> 16. <font> Hyp. lib. <$$font>
5. who says, They who accustom themselves to eat Hot things,
bring on themselves the Weakness of the Nerves, FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.138

and consequently decay their Eyesight, the Optick Nerves being signally
affected, through which Organs, Spirits ought to be conveyed principally
for the service of the Eyes.  To which Evil no doubt Sympathy makes
a great Addition, whether in the Individual, or in respect of others:
Wherein the Poet Philosophized, when he sang, <font> Cum spectant oculi
laesos laeduntur & ipsi.  <$$font> FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.139

But above all, the Sands, which have here the same effect as elsewhere.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.140

This is a Free Town, enfranchis'd with Liberties peculiar to its self,
being independent on any other Governor but its own; though he be but a
<font> Calenture <$$font> or Bayliff, giving Laws, and ruling by his own
Power, being accountable to none but the Emperor: FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.141

His Jurisdiction spreads a great way, for that he is not inferior in
Wealth to many <font> Cauns <$$font>, only somewhat less in Dignity.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.142

Mr. <font> Herbert <$$font> in his <font> Itinerary <$$font>
relates <font> Gerom <$$font> to have its denomination from certain <font>
Jews <$$font> who took up their Abode here, and gave it this Name in
honour of their <font> Kirjoth-Jerom <$$font>: FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.143

But whether more of that Nation dwell here than in other great Towns,
I am not thoroughly advertised, FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.144

and therefore forbear determining.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.145

A Mile from the Town had been a Coloss, now half ruined by Age, bearing
still some Marks of its pristine Majesty, it being more than Sixty Foot
high, and Thirty in Circumference, raised in Memory of some departed
Saint; FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.146

it overlooks a great many more humble Tombs, not liable therefore to
such Dilapidation.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,204.147

<P_2,205>

Leaving these, we pass through plough'd Fields, sowed with Wheat and
almost mowed, it being Harvest time.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.149

In this Plain abundance of Liquorice grows wild; FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.150

and by the Brooks sides are planted Country Mansions, with store of
Sallows and Willows.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.151

At Midnight we came to <font> Mocock Sugta <$$font> <paren> <font>
i. e. <$$font> a dry Clove <$$paren> Twenty two Miles,
having forded several Plashes where flourished lascivious Shrubs, more
like <font> Southernwood <$$font> than <font> Osiers <$$font>, till we
were inclosed in in the Mountains.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.152

The <font> Rhadars <$$font> here had apprehended a sturdy Thief, who
had set upon a poor Merchant, FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.153

and drove away his Ass loaded with <font> Indian <$$font> Cloth:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.154

These sort of Vermin are rare, either for the exemplary Punishment
inflicted, which is Immuring, when detected, or for the former mentioned
Satisfaction to be made by the <font> Shawbunder <$$font>, who employs
these <font> Rhadarees <$$font>, restoring to every one their proper
Goods, or else giving them the full Value.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.155

I shall not deviate much to give a credible Instance from our Agent,
who upon the Road by the Remissness of the <font> Shotters <$$font>
had his Gold Bridle and other Furniture stole out of a <font> Caravan
Ser Raw <$$font>, after they had come tired in.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,205.156

As soon as they were missing, upon notice given to the Captain of the
<font> Rhadars <$$font>, a strict Search being made presently, it was
not long e're the Criminal was detected, and taken with his Prize,
the latter restored, and the other left to the Mercy of the Agent, who
might have cut him to pieces without any other Formality of Process,
had he not <P_2,206> delivered him over to be chastised by his Accusers
, who were not wanting to inflict what Punishment his Fact deserved,
the next <font> Caun <$$font> adjudging him the Severity of the Law.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,206.157

Here again over the Portal of the Inn, were advanced the Crests to the
<font> Persian <$$font> Arms, I mean huge Rams-heads, Horns and all ,
which declare what would seem monstrous to relate, they surpassing
in Bulk as well as Courage all those of other Nations; not for their
Heads alone, but their Tails, which sometimes prove such Incumbrances
, that unless small Carts were ordained for their Carriage <paren>
especially the tame ones <$$paren>, they would trail upon the Ground,
and wound themselves against every sharp Stone and rough Piece of Ground
: FRYER-E3-P2,2,206.158

But these exalted are the Offspring of the Mountains, sheltring themselves
among the Rocks and untrodden Paths of the Hills.  Where, and in our
Passage, grew the Mountain- <font> Poly <$$font>, which struck our Scent,
till we descended a Fruitful Valley, abounding with Springs of Water,
which gave Increase to many Furlongs loaded with Rice or <font> Paddy
<$$font>, being courser than the <font> Indian <$$font>; from whence
not only <font> Persia <$$font>, but all the World besides, must fetch
the best and finest Rice.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,206.159

This Valley led us to <font> Caifer <$$font>, some Five <font> Pharsangs
<$$font>, a Village blest with all Fruits <font> Persia <$$font> glories
in, but above all, the choicest Oranges; FRYER-E3-P2,2,206.160

but this unseasonable Year, with the <P_2,207> help of the Locusts,
had blasted them all.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.161

This Town, as it terminates the Bounds of <font> Gerom <$$font>, so
it puts an end to the genuine Growth of the Palm-Tree, it being barren
beyond this Place, FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.162

and therefore only set in Great Mens Gardens for Shew, it delighting
rather in Hot and Dry Ground, such as Sands, and such as come nighest
in Nature to them: FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.163

Moreover, the Climate beyond this Place admits of too cold a Winter
for their Nourishment, which I impute to be the chiefest Cause.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.164

This Town is planted in the Bosom of two Rows of Hills, reaching <font>
Siras <$$font>, which delivers us to a delightful Plain, adorned with
Cypress-Trees on each hand, and plenteously stored with Villages and
Running Water on every side.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.165

And now it was pleasant to behold the Harvest-men labouring with their
Sythes, the Wheat blading low; the Ruther Beasts with distended Bags
grazing in the Meadows, the Sheep with their broad Tails gathered into
Folds, and the wary Shepherd on his Guard to defend them, as well as to
dress them when infected with any Maladies; FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.166

the Groves look'd Green, as in the midst of Summer's Pride, whose Bowers
the Winged Choristers made chearful with their unconfined Notes , their
Mirth as free as their Melody untaught, being actuated by no other Rule
than Instinct.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.167

These gave us hopes of future Moderation; FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.168

nor were they flattering; FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.169

for we had not traced Ten Miles of this pleasant Way, when we came to
<font> Firaw <$$font>, <paren> <font> The Foot of the Way <$$font>,
<$$paren> where <font> Aga Tocke <$$font> had placed a <font> Caravan
Ser Raw <$$font>; FRYER-E3-P2,2,207.170

but here we were forced to gather those Garments close <P_2,208> about
us, the wearing of which we hitherto rather thought an useless Decency,
than a real Requisite.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,208.171

From hence to <font> Mussaferry <$$font> we toiled through rugged and
uneasy Ways to a very splendid <font> Caravan Ser Raw <$$font>, some
Fourteen Miles more, where we took our Rest: FRYER-E3-P2,2,208.172

And thence along a sweet Campaign, watred by a delicate Rivulet on the
Left, at the Bottom of the declining Hills, bestowing its Blessing on
the adjacent Villages and Country Towns.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,208.173

We continued journying all this Night; wherefore the Sun had gilded the
Firmament with his Vermilion Red, before we took up at <font> Bobba Hodge
<$$font>, Thirty Miles compleat from our last Stage.  Where intending to
have been quiet, we were interrupted more than ever {we_were_interrupted}
by impertinent Gnats and Flies, by reason of the Concourse of Waters
nourishing abundance of Rushes and Fenny Plants, which harboured these
and gave them Refuge in the Day, FRYER-E3-P2,2,208.174

but at Night they broke out of their Lurking-Places, FRYER-E3-P2,2,208.175

and beset us with that Rage and Force, that no Resistance or Fence can
be made against them; FRYER-E3-P2,2,208.176

for, say they hyperbolically, They will bite through Armour; the best
<font> Persian <$$font> Boots <paren> which are low-heel'd and good
Cordavan Leather <$$paren> being not Proof against their Assaults.
Wherefore the Eve to the same Day, to avoid these invincible Assailants,
the disturbers of our Repose, we held on our Pace through Pasture-Grounds
, such as our Commons, where they are down-fed, that little more than
<P_2,209> Green-Sod appears, in which were wanton Foles and unback'd
Colts, with Mares for Breed, and unbridled Stallions, sporting on the
spacious Downs, which brought us onwards to <font> Siras <$$font> Twelve
Miles more, <font> viz. <$$font> to the <font> Beggars-Garden
<$$font> <paren> but one <font> Pharsang <$$font> short of the City
<$$paren> called <font> Udgewally <$$font>.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,209.177

Here we had scarcely alighted, but the <font> French <$$font> Agent having
notice of our coming, beat up our Quarters, and broke us of our Sleep.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,209.178

By Break of Day the <font> Armenian <$$font> Christians, which are
numerous, came to congratulate our Arrival, FRYER-E3-P2,2,209.179

and brought Banquets of Wine, Fruit, and a Cold Treat, with Led Horses
of State, and loud Musick, to make our Entry the more Pompous.  In order
whereunto, about Eleven in the Morning, conducted with much Ceremony, we
approached <font> Siras <$$font>, where we found Spectators answerable
to the Novelty of our Appearance, and the Greatness of our Train, with
which we were passing through this City nigh Two Hours, before we were
enclos'd within the Walls of the <font> English <$$font> House, which
is a Noble one, in the middle of a stately Garden.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,209.180

Hither came the Fathers of all Orders to bid us Welcome, that were
resident in the several Convents allowed them in this City; all which,
and other Christian Attendants, were not dismiss'd till after a Splendid
Dinner provided by our Interpreter, who makes some Thousands a Year
by the License of our Winepress, the Profit whereof is wholly his.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,209.181

The Wines of the Growth of this Country are esteemed the most Stomachical
and Generous in all <font> Persia <$$font>, and fittest for common
drinking, when allayed a little with Water, otherwise too heady for the
Brain, and heavy for <P_2,210> the Stomach, their Passage being retarded
for want of that proper Vehicle: FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.182

It is incredible to see what Quantities they drink at a Merry-meeting,
and how unconcerned the next day they appear, and brisk about their
Business, FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.183

and will quaff you thus a whole Week together.  In which Exercise when
they engage, they observe this Maxim, Always to lay in Ballast, they
eating heartily; FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.184

and all the time that Healths are passing about, they have Cucumbers,
Melons, and other Fruits before them, which must be acknowledged to
receive the most perfect Ripeness, and therefore are more innocent here
than any where else.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.185

Tobacco is a general Companion; FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.186

and to give them their due, they are Conversable Good-Fellows, sparing
no one his Bowl in their turn; FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.187

and to be sure none shall escape a Nosegay, Orange, or some such Mark
as passes with every Health; so that sometimes when they mind Discourse
more than the Business in hand, a whole Nest of Posies wait on one Man,
who must clear himself, or disgust those whose Healths remain unpledg'd.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.188

Having discharg'd the Fatigue of this Day, it remained incumbent on
our parts to return these Civilities, which was to renew the Trouble
again, each striving to outvye others in their Entertainments:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.189

In these Courteous Visits we spent a Week, FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.190

nor was that sufficient, FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.191

but we being late in the Year for this Journey to <font> Spahaun <$$font>
, our Interpreter excused our Neglect.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,210.192

<P_2,211>

<heading>

CHAP. IV.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.195

<font> Of <$$font> Siras, <font> and the Ancient City <$$font>
Persepolis, <font> and our Journying quite through <$$font> Persia.
FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.196

<$$heading>

In our Stay here we had Opportunity to observe <font> Siras <$$font>,
not only by Fame, but indeed to be, second to none, except the Royal City,
in the whole Empire: FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.198

And in this Country, the Country which is properly <font> Persia <$$font>
<paren> extended from the Gulph to <font> Esduchos <$$font>, which parts
<font> Parthia <$$font> from it by a great Ditch made for a Boundary
on that Side to this Ancient Kingdom <$$paren> it is the principal
Metropolis.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.199

It is delivered as a Tradition, That it arose from the Ruins of <font>
Persepolis <$$font>: FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.200

Others will have it as old as <font> Cyrus, <$$font> who contend for him
to be the Founder, for that the nearness of the Name intimates as much:
FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.201

But that he should raise it as a Monument, seems not so probable,
who would not permit it at his Death, as {it_seems_probable} that
these People, devoted to his Memory, might on the Miscarriage of <font>
Persepolis <$$font>, raise this in Honour of him, whose Remembrance might
at once revive the Glory of the then fallen Monarchy, and bury the hated
Name of the new Conqueror in Oblivion, who had sullied all his Lawrels
by hearkning to the unlimited Revenge of a Prostitute, to lay the most
flourishing <font> Persepolis <$$font> in Ashes, from whence, <font>
Phoenix <$$font> like, this is supposed to spring.  FRYER-E3-P2,2,211.202
