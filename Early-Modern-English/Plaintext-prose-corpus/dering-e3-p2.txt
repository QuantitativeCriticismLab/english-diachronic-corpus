Worthy Sir, Wee are still in the same distracted Expectassion {in}
you left us; DERING-E3-P2,116.3

only our fears a little increase, as the Armye draws nearer;
DERING-E3-P2,116.4

it lyes now at St. Albons; DERING-E3-P2,116.5

tomorrow the King comes to Tibbalds; and on Saterday to Richmond.
DERING-E3-P2,116.6

This day we here of a Declaration from the Army, DERING-E3-P2,116.7

but $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} not to be seene till tomorrow, DERING-E3-P2,116.8

therfore I cann give you no account of it.  DERING-E3-P2,116.9

I spake to Mr. Haberfield about that stone DERING-E3-P2,116.10

but he sayes he hath allowd for Sir Anthony's funerall and he hath no
more in that kind to doe, so that I must take care of it; and if you
please to speake to Rob: Venetian, who is at Denton, DERING-E3-P2,116.11

he knowes where the stone is at Dover DERING-E3-P2,116.12

and will, I presume, gett <P_117> it brought safe to Denton.
DERING-E3-P2,117.13

I will sattisfie the charg of it, DERING-E3-P2,117.14

and you will be a noble worthy frend if you please to see it layd, after
theyr Armes are Ingraven upon it and some Inscription worthy of them.
DERING-E3-P2,117.15

I understand by Mr. Haberfield that Mr. Barling told him
that I was buisey to undervalue the goods and beate downe the price sett
in the Inventory of severall things.  DERING-E3-P2,117.16

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} beleve him so unworthy.  DERING-E3-P2,117.17

Somthing that I knew the value of better then he, who would have over
rated it, DERING-E3-P2,117.18

I told him he was mistaken.  DERING-E3-P2,117.19

$One was a little bableing silver watch she had, which he would prize
at 12=ll=.  DERING-E3-P2,117.20

I told him, as was true, it never cost 4=ll=, DERING-E3-P2,117.21

and so of other things.  DERING-E3-P2,117.22

Pray when you see him tell him of it.  DERING-E3-P2,117.23

Is there none but falce Hearts under those black coates -
DERING-E3-P2,117.24

He parted with me in the greatest civillity and complement that could
be; DERING-E3-P2,117.25

but I have done.  DERING-E3-P2,117.26

Pray present my true and affectionat respects to your Dearest, sweete
Mrs. Oxinden.  DERING-E3-P2,117.27

Sir your faithfull frend to serve you Unton Dering {COM:June_1647}

<P_118>

<heading:edcomment:LXXIV_UNTON,_LADY_DERING_TO_HENRY_OXINDEN>

Sir, I thank you for your acceptance of my endeavors which were very
hearty to serve you; and your promise to preserve me iust in my word,
which is a reall kindnes, DERING-E3-P2,118.31

for it is pretious to mee: DERING-E3-P2,118.32

I shall not be forgettfull of your desiers.  DERING-E3-P2,118.33

Sir, you know how unhappiely frendless those dear pledges of my pretious
frends and yours <paren> so you are pleased to value them <$$paren>
are left; and my selfe and sister as women being altogether unable and
unfitt to undergoe the care of that little estate left unto them; and
my eldest brother at so great a distance as he $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
nether performe that office of love and <P_119> regard toward them that
otherwise he would and desiers.  DERING-E3-P2,119.34

Wee have interested in the troblesome part of it, as setting and letting
and payeing, Mr. Haberfield chiefly; DERING-E3-P2,119.35

and Mr. Kitchell is willing to be his assistant in his absence
or anything difficult; DERING-E3-P2,119.36

and Mr. Haberfield to be every yeare accountable to Sir Phillip
Percivall of the disposall of the estate belonging to them - who upon our
intreaty and his affection to those gone is very willing to be interested
for them in anything for theyr good - DERING-E3-P2,119.37

Only he desiers some gentleman, and frend to them may be, be ioynd
with him in the Contrye wher the estat is; by whom the faire carage of
Haberfield will be better desernd, and no accedent of absence or otherwise
be preiudiciall to the children, for theyr education or otherwise.
DERING-E3-P2,119.38

This frendly charitable office we doe intreat you <paren> of whose
loving regard and true well-wishes to those poore unhappie orphans wee
are very confiedent <$$paren> to joyne with Sir Phillip Percivall in,
DERING-E3-P2,119.39

and we shall acknowledg it, as it will justly deserve, a curtesye of a
Noble and true frend.  DERING-E3-P2,119.40

Pray lett me know by the next returne whether you will be pleased to
wellcome this troble - DERING-E3-P2,119.41

For I shall as soone as this Terme is done, returne home -
DERING-E3-P2,119.42

We are yett here undisturb'd by the Armye.  DERING-E3-P2,119.43

The demanded members have withdrawne themselves from the House,
DERING-E3-P2,119.44

but that will not serve; DERING-E3-P2,119.45

the Army requiers to have them suspended the House; DERING-E3-P2,119.46

$'t $'is {TEXT:t'is} thought they will doe the King's buissnes and then
he will doe theyrs.  DERING-E3-P2,119.47

God send us a good peace by any means {by} he please.  DERING-E3-P2,119.48

My best respects to yourselfe and Dearest DERING-E3-P2,119.49

I am unfainedly Your affectionat true frend Un. Dering.

<heading:edcomment:LXXIX_UNTON,_LADY_DERING,_TO_HENRY_OXINDEN>

Sir, According to your desier, I have spoken with Mr. Beven of
Ashford concerning your daughters being with him; DERING-E3-P2,128.56

he is very willing to doe you and them any servis in his power,
DERING-E3-P2,128.57

and I am confiedent you will receave very good sattisfaction in your
charge, DERING-E3-P2,128.58

for he is a conscienable, discreete man, and one that stands uppon his
creditt; and so industerous for the benifitting of his schollers as if
they be willing to receave, he will spare no paines to bring them to
perfection; as I cann wittnes by experiance, when he taught my daughter.
DERING-E3-P2,128.59

And besides the quallietyes of musicke both for the virgenalls and singing
<paren> if they have voices <$$paren> and writing <paren> and to cast
account which will be usefull to them hereafter <$$paren> he will be
carefull also that theyr behaviour be modest and such as becomes theyr
qualliety; and that they grow in knowledg and understanding of God and
theyr duty to him, which is above all.  DERING-E3-P2,128.60

For truely he is able to performe all this exceeding well:
DERING-E3-P2,128.61

and $'t $'is {TEXT:t'is} his delight as well as his duty.
DERING-E3-P2,128.62

They shall want no attendance or ought els nessessary for them,
DERING-E3-P2,128.63

for his wife is an excellent good woman, and his daughter a civill well
quallified mayde, DERING-E3-P2,128.64

and both work very well.  DERING-E3-P2,128.65

I presume you will think 30=ll= a yeare for both reasonable, when you
consider the hardnes of the times and that there is more troble with
Girles then boys; DERING-E3-P2,128.66

and receave assuerance from me that these quallietys shall not be taught
superviciously but really, if your daughters will bee industerous.
DERING-E3-P2,128.67

Pray lett me here your resolution speediely; and I shall be glad therwith
to be sattisfied of your and your beloved safe <P_129> returne home.
DERING-E3-P2,129.68

With my affectionat thanks for the favor of your companys here; though
but a short time, <paren> so short as I cann scarse think it other then
a dreame <$$paren>.  I shall hope for some other Opertunytie to express
better how much I vallue it; DERING-E3-P2,129.69

in the mean time ever pray esteeme me as Unfainedly I am to you both A
truely affectionat frend Un. Dering.  DERING-E3-P2,129.70

Surenden Dering DERING-E3-P2,129.71

the 2=d= of Aug. 1647.  DERING-E3-P2,129.72

I pray Intreat your wife to inquire how that sweete little babe of my
dear sister Per: is used by her Nurse.  DERING-E3-P2,129.73

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} beleve this report that she uses it ill and
beates itt.  DERING-E3-P2,129.74

<heading:edcomment:LXXX_SAME_TO_SAME>

Sir, The chainge of the weather makes me hasten the dispatch of my
buissness at Denton, and by that opertunytie to returne you a more full
answer to your letter.  DERING-E3-P2,129.76

First for your daughters; Mr. Beven is this Michellmas removed
from Ashford; but noe farther then to Mersham, where Sir Norton Knatchbull
lives.  DERING-E3-P2,129.77

He will be settled there this weeke, and all accommodation as good there,
if not better, then at Ashford; DERING-E3-P2,129.78

and $'t $'is {TEXT:t'is} somewhat neerer you.  DERING-E3-P2,129.79

As soone as you shall please to send them he will respectively wellcome
them; DERING-E3-P2,129.80

and promises me faithfully nothing shall be wanting to them <paren>
in his power <$$paren> for their good everywaie; DERING-E3-P2,129.81

and he hopes you shall receave good sattisfaction in theyr time spent
with him.  DERING-E3-P2,129.82

He hath a daughter, a civill well-disposed and discreete young mayde:
who works very well and playes excellent well of the virgenols; who
shall attend them and accompany them in theyr imployments all day.
DERING-E3-P2,129.83

For the stone at Dovor, I will have it brought to Denton <P_130> by all
means; and new polished; DERING-E3-P2,130.84

and because it is to lye on the ground, an ingraven Epitaph will be
difficultly reade and be a good Charge; though I must ever think the
preservation of the memory of theyr worths <paren> in any kind <$$paren>
above all such consideration.  DERING-E3-P2,130.85

Yet not knowing how anything but of nessessity will be approved that I
doe, I desier the favor of you to Appoynt it to be brought from Dovor
and to be new polished; and both theyr Armes with Crests in severall
scuchions to be ingraven upon it, with theyr Names, Ages, and day
of Death.  DERING-E3-P2,130.86

And for those affectionat and frendly expressions you have made of
them <paren> for which you doe more and more indeere my best respective
acknowledgments to you <$$paren>, I would have them written upon a Table
, the ground black and the letters gold, and put in a black frame and
hung up by the table of Armes, which I think will be more proper then
ingraving it upon the stone.  DERING-E3-P2,130.87

The Arms and Crest etc., Gibbs of Cantb. can give, of both.
DERING-E3-P2,130.88

My brother's age I know not, DERING-E3-P2,130.89

she was about 33 <paren> if it be materiall to sett downe theyr ages
<$$paren>; DERING-E3-P2,130.90

and I shall be much oblieged to you if you will please to take
order for the doeing of it: and to direct the layeing of the stone;
DERING-E3-P2,130.91

and what the charge is I will be thankfully answereable to you for.
DERING-E3-P2,130.92

The money I shall be very well sattisfied should be in your Hands, and
upon the securiety alone of your bond and Mr. Denn's, if it were
my owne; as I have given you testimony of; DERING-E3-P2,130.93

but being intrusted for orphans, and of so deere parents; and more,
<paren> for this would well suit with my confiedence in you <$$paren>
many eyes being upon mee <paren> as Mr. Haberfield writs me word
<$$paren>, it will concerne mee to bee circumspect to prevent in the
beginning their censures; though time will shew them in the end how
vaine theyr aptnes to jelloesies of me are.  DERING-E3-P2,130.94

Therfore since I know your intensions are as just as I cann wish them ,
yett bee pleas'd, for full sattisfaction, to give your bond and Mr.
Denn's, and to acknowledge a recognizance, and after my returne from
London, the money shall be redy; wich will be about a month after <P_131>
Michellmas.  DERING-E3-P2,131.95

A $100 =ll= {TEXT:100=ll=} you might have presently: DERING-E3-P2,131.96

the rest is not yett gathered together.  DERING-E3-P2,131.97

I must begg your pardon for my tedyous expressions, which have, I feare ,
to long detained you from your better spent time.  DERING-E3-P2,131.98

I have only to present my affectionate respects to sweete Mrs.
Oxenden and your selfe, with assurance that I am Your professed faithfull
frend Unton Dering.  DERING-E3-P2,131.99
