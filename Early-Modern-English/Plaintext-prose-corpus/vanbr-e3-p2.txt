<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> Sir, I am very much beholding to
you, truly.  VANBR-E3-P2,30.236

<font> Coup. <$$font> You may be, Sirrah, before the Wedding-day
yet, VANBR-E3-P2,30.237

the Lady is a great Heiress; VANBR-E3-P2,30.238

Fifteen hundred Pound a year, and a great Bag of Money; VANBR-E3-P2,30.239

the Match is concluded, VANBR-E3-P2,30.240

the Writings are drawn, VANBR-E3-P2,30.241

and the $Pipkin $'s {TEXT:Pipkin's} to be crack'd in a Fortnight -
VANBR-E3-P2,30.242

and has promis'd me as much more in ready Money upon the Day of
Marriage, which I understand by a Friend, he ne'er designs to pay me;
VANBR-E3-P2,30.246

if therefore you will be a generous young Dog, and secure me Five
thousand Pounds, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be a covetous old Rogue, and help
you to the Lady.  VANBR-E3-P2,30.247

VANBR-E3-P2,30.250

This plump Partridge, that I tell you of, lives in the Country, Fifty
Miles off, with her Honoured Parents, in a lonely old House which nobody
comes near; VANBR-E3-P2,30.251

she never goes abroad, VANBR-E3-P2,30.252

nor sees Company at home: VANBR-E3-P2,30.253

To prevent all Misfortunes, she has her breeding within doors,
VANBR-E3-P2,30.254

the Parson of the Parish teaches her to play on the Base-Viol, the Clerk
to sing, her Nurse to dress, and her Father to dance: VANBR-E3-P2,30.255

In short, no body can give you admittance there but I, VANBR-E3-P2,30.256

nor can I do it any other way, than by making you pass for your Brother.
VANBR-E3-P2,30.257

<font> Y. Fash. <$$font> And how the Devil wilt thou
do that?  VANBR-E3-P2,30.258

immediately, VANBR-E3-P2,31.264

and when the Fatigue of the $Wedding-Night $'s {TEXT:Wedding-Night's}

VANBR-E3-P2,31.274

VANBR-E3-P2,76.679

VANBR-E3-P2,76.680

<font> Sir Tun. <$$font> Why now to shew you how many Lies People

<font> Lord Fop. <$$font> Why what do you see in his Face to make

I can do nothing.  VANBR-E3-P2,78.766

<font> Nurse.  <$$font> Who wou'd have thought that ever your Invention

<font> Miss.  <$$font> Well, I have often thought old folks Fools,
VANBR-E3-P2,78.768

and now $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sure they are so; VANBR-E3-P2,78.769

I have found a way my self to secure us all.  VANBR-E3-P2,78.770

<font> Nurse.  <$$font> Dear Lady $what $'s {TEXT:what's} that?

<font> Bull.  <$$font> Nay, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} my business to speak
to, Nurse; VANBR-E3-P2,78.779

I do confess, to take two Husbands for the satisfaction of the Flesh,
is to commit the Sin of Exorbitancy; VANBR-E3-P2,78.780

but to do it for the Peace of the Spirit, is no more than {it_is} be
drunk by way of Physick; VANBR-E3-P2,78.781

besides, to prevent a Parent's Wrath, is to <P_79> avoid the Sin of
Disobedience; VANBR-E3-P2,79.782

for when the $Parent $'s {TEXT:Parent's} angry, the Child is froward.
So that upon the whole Matter, I do think, tho'Miss shou'd Marry again,
she may be sav'd.  VANBR-E3-P2,79.783

<font> Miss.  <$$font> I Cod, and I will marry again then,
