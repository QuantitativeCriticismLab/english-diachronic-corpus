Thus ended she her song, when greedy me & astond with lyfted eares, the

"of wearyd myndes, how much hast thou reviued me, with waight of sentence,
or pleasantnes of song.  so as heerafter I shall think me not inferiour
to fortunes strokes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.8

and so the remedyes that a little before thou saidst to sharp, not only
doo I not feare, BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.9

but ernest to heare of I greedely beseech. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.10

Then she: BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.11

"I perceauid,"quoth she,"when silently our wordes with attentyue care
thou cacht, that this state of thy mynde eyther I lookt for, or that is
truer, my self haue made: BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.12

The rest that doth remayne, be such that tasted, smartes, but inwardly
received, sweetens.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.13

But for that thou namest thy self ernest to heare, with what desyres
shouldest thou be inflamed, yf thou couldst know whither we meane to

"Whither? "quoth I; BOETHEL-E2-P2,43.15

"to true felicitie, which thy mynde dreames of, whose eyes being vsed

goes on in diuers pathes, BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.25

and yet stryves to com to one end of bliss: BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.26

But that is right good which a man obtayning, no furder may desyre,
which is of all the greatest good, & in it self contaynes them all,
of which if any want, it can not be the moste, BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.27

for outwardly were left somthing to be wisht.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.28

Playne then it is, that state of all good thinges perfect in his
gathering, is onely blisse.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.29

This, as we sayde, by diuers path all mortall $mens {TEXT:men} indeuors
gett.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.30

For nature hath ingraft in mens mynd desyre of truest good,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,44.31

but strayeng errour to falshode doth seduce vs.  Among whom som,
beleeuing hit greatest good nothing to want, stryve <P_45> to be rych

Citizens honour.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.32

Others ther be that settels greatest good in hyest powre.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.33

such will or raigne themselves, BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.34

or stryve to cleave to such as doo.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.35

But they that suppose honour greatest good, they eyther with warre or
peaces worth hast to inlarge a glorious name.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.36

But many good men measure the frute of good with joy & mirth,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.37

and they think it happyest to wallow in delytes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.38

Then be to, that enterchange ech end & care with other,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.39

as they that riches & delyte for powres sake desyre, the other powre
for monnyes sake or glory doo desyre.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.40

In these & such lyke humayne actes or desyres, intent abydes, as Nobilitie
& popular fame they seeme to get som show.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.41

wyfe & children for plesure sake desyre, BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.42

but partaking of {TEXT:of_of} frendes <paren> that holyest is <$$paren>
not reckon by fortune nor force, BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.43

The rest eyther for powres sake or delyte be taken.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.44

It is playne that bodyes good to hyer thinges be referd, whose strength &
bygnes it is that makes their woork commended.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.45

Beauty & agilitie their fame, hath their delyte, to whom only bliss they
ad, BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.46

for that that ech man thinkes above the rest exceede, that greatest good
he thinkes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.47

And greatest we suppose blisse to be, which makes men think blessedst
thing, that ech man above the rest couetes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.48

Before thyn eyes thou hast the forme sett out of mans felicitie, Riches ,
honour, powre, glory, and delyte, which last only the Epicure considering,
hit followes that the greatest good he thought, for that delyte bringes
all delytefull thing to mynde.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.49

But let me retourn to mans study, whose mynde albeit with blynded memory ,
yet seekes the greatest good, but as dronken man knowes not the path to
bring him home.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.50

Doo they seeme to err that nothing to neede desyres?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.51

for that nought can so well obtayne happynes as flowing state of all good
thinges, not needing others, contented with it self.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.52

Be they deceaud that hit supposith best, that worthyest is of Reuerente
respecte?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,45.53

No sure, BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.55

nether is that vyle to be despisde that the care of ech mans labour
couettes to gett.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.56

Is not force to be nombred among good thinges?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.57

What then, BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.58

is that weake and to be estemid feeble, that of all other thinges
exceedes?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.59

Is not honour to be regarded?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.60

It can not be denyed, but that that is most worth, ought be most honord.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.61

For carefull sorowfull, blisse we can not call, BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.62

nor subiecte to care & woe we may not saye, when in lest thinges that
is desyrd, that most delytes haue & enioye.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.63

And these be those which men wold obtayne, & for their cause desyre
ryches, dignitie, Raygnes, glory, & delytes.  for that by these
they beleeue they may gett ynough, honour, powre, glory, and Joye.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,46.64

Good it is therfore that men by so many ways doo seeke; In which, what

"You allso o erthly wightes, though by single figure doo dreame of your
own begynning.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.71

& that true end of blissednes perceaue, tho with no playne yet with sour
thought, vnderstand.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.72

And thither bringes you a naturall instinct to true goodnes,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.73

and increasing errour leades yo=u= from the same.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.74

Consider therfore, whither men can obtayne their end desyrd, by those
meanes that men suppose gettes happynes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.75

For if eyther monny, honors, or such lyke can bring such thinges to whom
nothing is lacking of, best, let vs then confesse that som men may be
happy by their obteyning.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.76

For if neyther they can doo that they promise & wantes greatest good
, is it not euident that they haue but a false show of blessidnes?
BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.77

First therfore let me ask the` that a little afore aboundedst in ryches
, BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.78

Among thy flowing heaps, did not conceyte of conceauid iniury amase thy
mynde? "BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.79

"I can not remember,"quoth I,"that euer my mynde was so free but somwhat
greeuid it. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.80

"Was it not because that was a waye that thou woldest not forgo, or was
with the` that thou caredst not for? "BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.81

I answerd,"so it is. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.82

"Then thou desyredst the ones presence, and the others want?
"BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.83

I confesse.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.84

"Does any man neede than,"quoth she,"that euery man wantes & needes?
BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.85

He that lackes is not wholly content.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.86

No, sure.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.87

When thou hadst welth ynough, hadst thou not this want? "
BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.88

"What els? "said I.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.89

"Then Riches can not make a man lack nothing, nor yet content himself.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.90

And this is that promise they seemed.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.91

This I suppose ought most be considered, that monny of his own
nature hath nothing that he can not be spoyled of that possesses it.
"BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.92

I confesse it.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.93

"Why shouldst thou not confesse yt.  Whan a mightyer takes it away from
the vnwilling.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.94

Whence come these Courtes complayntes?  but that coyne is taken away
from the losers by force or guyle?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.95

He shall haue neede therfore of outward help by which his monny he
may keepe.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.96

Who can this deny?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.97

He should not cede such help that possest of monny lose he wold not.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.98

This is doutles.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.99

The matter is fallen otherwise now, BOETHEL-E2-P2,48.100

for such <P_49> riches as were thought sufficient of them selves, are
needy of others ayde.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.101

But what is the way to dryve away lack from ryches?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.102

for rych men can they not honger, BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.103

Can they not thirst, BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.104

nor can not somtyme the cold wynter hurt the lymmes of the rich man?
BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.105

But you will say, they haue ynough, thurst & colde to dryue away.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.106

But by this meanes yo=u= may saye the lack of rich men may be comforted,
neuer $taken {TEXT:take} away.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.107

For if she euer gape & serch for som thing els, tho fild with ryches
ynough, it must be that ther somthing remaynes that it should be filld
withall.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.108

I neede not tell you that Nature with lest, & Auarice with nothing
is contented.  Wherfore if nether Riches can take away their lack,
& they make their own neede, why should we think them sufficient?

"But thou wilt say dignities makes honorable, reuerenced to whom they hap.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.114

Haue $then dignities this force?  that they can ingraff in vsers myndes
vertue, & expulse vice.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.115

Nay, they are wont, not to chace iniquitie but to adorn it; so as we
disdayne somtyme that they should hap to wickedst men: wherfore Catullus,
tho Nonius sate as Curule, calld him Lump of flesh.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.116

Dost thou see how great a shame somtyme dignity receuith?  Which
indignitie should not be so euident, if honour should not show it.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,49.117

accompany Decoratus in office, when in him you sawe a mynde of a wicked
Ruffin, and slanderer tongue?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.118

For we can not for honors sake iudge them worthy Reuerence whom we
suppose vnworthy of their dignities.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.119

But if thou sawest a wyse man, couldst thou not think him wourthy of
reuerence euin for that wisdom he enioyes?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.120

Yes surely, BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.121

for ther is a peculiar dignitie for vertue, which alltogither is bestowde
on them to whom she haps.  Which because they $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
euer haue popular honors, they may not enioy the beauty of their worth:
wherin this is to be noted, that if it be the lesse worth, that it is
dispised of many, when they can not make them reuerenced, thorow the
contempt that many makes it, Then honour makes many wicked; but yet not
without punishment; BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.122

for wicked men giues this good turn to dignitie, that they spot them
with their own infection.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.123

And that thou mayst know that true honour can not hap by these shaded
dignities, gather it $thus {TEXT:this}: BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.124

Yf a man haue oft tymes bene Consul, & fortune to com to barbarous
Nations, shall there honour make him be esteemd?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.125

Yf this be a naturall gyft to all dignities, whither euer they go, they
should vse the self office, As the fyre in ech Country neuer leaues
to burne.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.126

But because not their own force but false humayne opinion hath bred it
, straight they vanish, when to them they com that esteemes not such
dignities.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.127

but thus much for foren Nations.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.128

He was wont be greate that cared for the peeples prouisions.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.131

$Now, what baser than that office?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,50.132

For as a little afore I said, That it had nothing in it self of his own
proper valure, that takes or loses luster <P_51> by the vsers opinion.
Yf then honors can not make men reuerenced, which are despisd by wicked
mens infection, if by change of tyme they leave to be famous, yf by vulgar
opinion despysd, what beauty haue they in them selves, or can giue others?

Yf, as Aristotle sayes, men could vse Linxes eyes, to peirce throw that

For a little afore begynning from bliss, thou saydst she was <P_72>
greatest good, which only abode in the greatest God.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,72.279

Then thou saydst that God himself was the greatest good & blisse, of
whom no man was made blessed, but he that was lyke to him, And that thou

PROSE.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.295

<$$heading>

Thus when Philosophy her stately looke & graue countenance keeping, In
mylde & sweete sorte had song, Then I, not forgetting my late ingraven
woe, burst out to tell som part of my intent. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.297

O,"quoth I,"Thou, the guide of true light, such thinges as thy talke
hitherto hath vtterd, by diuine speculation & Reason thyne, are showed
inuincible.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.298

And though the same of late my iniuryes sorowe forgate, yet altogither
of them I was not ignorant.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.299

But this was the self & greatest cause of all my woe, that when the
Righter of all thing is good, eyther at all euills can be, or vnpunished
pas.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.300

That, how worthy wonder it is, consider I pray yo=u=.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.301

But to this a greater mater is added.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.302

For wickednes ruling & florishing, not only vertue wantes rewarde,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.303

but subiect to the feete of wicked men, is troden downe
BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.304

& suffers payne that wicked folkes deserue.  Which happening in a Raigne
of him that all knowes, all $may, and such a god that wills but only
that is good, No man can but mervell and complayne.  "BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.305

"It should be worthy mervell,"quoth she,"And horrible more than any
monster, if, as thou supposest, in a house guyded by such a master, base
vessells should be esteemd, & precious are despisd.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.306

But so it is not.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.307

For if such thinges be kepte which we of late concluded, & be kepte
togither, he being the maker of whose kingdom we spake, thou shalt knowe
that euer good men be mighty, yll men slaues & weake.  And how vice is
neuer without punishment, nor vertue without rewarde.  And how prosperitie
to the good, yll luck to euill betydes.  And such lyke, which may leaving
quarrels, strengthen the` with steddy soundnes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,75.308

And for that thou haste seene the picture of true blisse, which I shewed

"Therfore all good men & yll stryve to com to the best by diuers
intentes! "BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.335

"So it is.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.336

BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.337

"But is it sure that good men doo allwayes obtayne that they desyre?
"BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.338

"But if yll men might obtayne good, they could not be yll. "
BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.340

"When they both desyre good, but the one gettes it, the other not,

"Who euer,"quoth I,"doutes therof neyther can consider Natures property,

"Then if twoo ther be that by nature requires one thing, one of them

"But the greatest good,"said she,"that is set before yll & good , the

BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.351

& stryue to get that which is no proper gift, to such as will obtayne

"No,"quoth I,"BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.354

Resisting Nature.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,78.358

But for that I see the` redyest to understand, I will <P_79> heape vp
many reasons.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.359

Beholde, how greate a weakenes is there appeers in vicious men that
can not obtayne that to which their naturall intent leades & well nye
compells.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.360

And what if they be left of the greate & almost invincible help of his
precedent nature?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.361

Consider how great a feblenes holdes wicked men.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.362

For nether can they gett light & vayne rewardes, which they can not
obtayne, but fayles in the Top of height, BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.363

neither does good effect hap to the wretched, euen the same that night &
day they seeke.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.364

And yet in self same thing we see the good mens strenghth excell.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.365

For as a man that walkes to that place whence chefely he wold com, being
such as has no way beyond, woldst thou not think him best footeman?
BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.366

so $shouldst {TEXT:shoulst} thou think him mightyest that can comprehend
the end, beyond which no furder is.  Wherby it haps that who contrary is,
the same be wicked & weake of all strength.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.367

For why doo they follow vice, leaving vertue behind them?
BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.368

For ignorance of good?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.369

But what is more feeble than ignorance blyndnes?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.370

But they know what follow they ought?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.371

But their lust doth ouerthrow them: BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.372

so doth intemperance the frayle men that in vice be delited.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.373

But wittingly & knowing do they leave that is good, and so bend them
to vice?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.374

This waye, not only without powre, but they leave to be.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.375

For they that forsake the common end of all thinges that be, they leave
themselves to be.  Which may seeme strange to men, that euill men <paren>
that many be <$$paren> we shall not say to be, BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.376

but so the case standth.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.377

For they that euill be, I deny them not to be yll, BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.378

but I deny that they be purely or simply.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.379

For as we call a Carcas, a dead man, symply we can not call him man:
so vicious men we graunte them to be yll, BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.380

but absolutely to be, that can we not confesse.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.381

For ther is that, that keps & retaynes Natures order: BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.382

Ther is that fayles from that, BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.383

& leaves that in their Nature is grafted.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.384

But thou wilt say, yll men may doo, BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.385

nether can I denye.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.386

But this powre to doo coms not of force, but of weaknes.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,79.387

For they can doo yll, which they should not doo, if they wold remayn in
their creation of good.  <P_80> Which possibilitie to doo, In not dooing
shewes they can doo nothing.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.388

For yf, as we haue gatherd afore, euill be nothing, when but only the
yll they can doo, wicked men can doo nothing. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.389

"$That $'s {TEXT:Thats} playne. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.390

"And that you may understand what is the force of this powre, we haue
defynd afore, that nothing is fuller of force than the greatest good.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.391

But that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} the wicked doo.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.392

But what man is that thinkes man can doo all? "BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.393

"None but a mad man will so think. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.394

"And that the same can doo yll to? "BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.395

"Wold God they could not,"quoth I.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.396

"When then he is mightest that can do all good, & mightyest men in yll ,
can not such thinges obtayne, then is it playne, that they can lest doo
that be wicked.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.397

And so it haps, that rightly we haue showed, all powre to consist in
thinges to be obtaynd; And all such referd to greatest good, as to the

desyrd therfore it ought not be, BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.400

& all powre is to be desyrd: BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.401

weaknes of wicked men, veryfyeing Platoes sentence, to be true, that
only wise men can performe, that they desyre to doo.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,80.402

For it is no wrong that of thinges don, that be ech reward for which
ech thing is don: as a Runner in a race has a guarland for which he ran,
in rewarde.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.414

But we haue shewed how blisse is that self good, for which all thinges
be don.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.415

Then it followes that the only good is sett as the vniuersall reward
to men.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.416

And this from good men can not be deuided, BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.417

for nether can he be iustly cald a good man by right, that wantith
true good.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.418

Therfore good conditions can neuer want rewarde.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.419

For though euill men afflicte them, a wise mans Garland shall not fall
nor wither.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,81.420

For other <P_82> mens wickednes can not pluck away the true honour from
honest myndes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.421

For yf he reioyce at ought received from outward meane, som other man
or he that gaue it might take it awaye.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.422

But because Godlynes it self suffisith, then shall he want reward,
when he leaves so to be.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.423

Lastly, since all rewarde is therfore desyrd, because it is beleeuid good,
who can think an honest man, without rewarde?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.424

But of what?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.425

Of that that is fayrest & greatest.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.426

Remember this breefe that a little afore I gaue you to be the cheefest,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.427

& so conclude: When the greatest good is blisfulnes, they must needes
be happy that are good, because they are so.  And they that be happy,
must needes be lyke to God.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.428

Therfore good mens reward is such as neyther any day drawes away, nor
powre minish, nor Ire darken, BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.429

but lyke to him they be.  Which being true, no wise man may doute of
the wicked mans inseparable payne.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.430

For where both good & yll, payne & reward be crosse one to an other,
it followes that such reward as haps to goodnes, the same must needes
be of contrary sorte, for payne of wicked.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.431

For as sinceritie to the honest is rewarde, so to the wicked their
vnhappynes is their plage.  So as who euer is punisht must needes
be wicked.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.432

Yf therfore they wold way well themselves, can they suppose them voyde of
payne, whose wickdnes in all ylls not only touchith them, but greevously
infectes?  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.433

See on thother syde, such parte as is to the good contrary,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.434

what payne doth follow them.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.435

I haue taught yo=u= afore that all that is, must be one, and that the
only good is one.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.436

Then it followes, to what so that is, that seemes to be good.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.437

Then whosoeuer faylith from that good he leaves to be: so that, when
euill they be, they leave to that they were; BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.438

but to prove that men they were, the forme their humayne body shewith,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.439

but turned into malice, they haue left their humayne nature.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.440

And since that true pietie alone may lift vp a man, it followes, that
whom wickednes hath throwen downe from state of man, hath cast him downe
beneth the merit of man.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.441

So it haps, that whom transformed thou seest with vice, thou mayst not
suppose him a man.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,82.442

<P_83>

The violent robber of others goodes is farvent in his robberyes,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.444

swellith in coueting, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.445

& mayst call him woolflyke, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.446

feerce & contentious, exercises his tongue in bralles, euin lyke a dog.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.447

The secret lurker joyes with fraude to catche.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.448

And so is foxlyke, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.449

untemperate in ire he chafith, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.450

& men beleeue him a lyar; BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.451

but fearfull & flyeing, fearith & dredith that needes not,
BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.452

And he to deere is compared.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.453

The sluggy & dullard languishith BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.454

& lyke an ass doth lyve.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.455

The light & vnconstant man changes his intentes, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.456

& differs so nought from the byrdes, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.457

And is plunged in filthy & vncleane lustes, BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.458

And is kept in the delyte of his owne lewdnes.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.459

And so it haps, that he that forsakyth honesty leaues to be a man;
BOETHEL-E2-P2,83.460

for not to be able to attayne a dyuine state, is tournid to the bestly.

Than I began: BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.467

"I se,"quoth I,"what felicitie or misery it is, that is sett in the
desertes of honest & wicked men.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.468

But in common fortune I see, but little good or yll to be.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.469

For no wise man wold rather choose to be exul, poore, dispisde,
than riche, reuerenced, mighty, & florishing abide in his own Citie.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.470

For then more plainly & with better witnes, is the propertie of wisdom
seene, when the happines of Rulers be as it were skatterd among such
peeple as be straungers, When cheefely geayle, lawe & other tormentes
for due punishment rather pertayne to wicked Citizens; for whom they
were first ordeynd.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.471

But when these be turnd in wry sorte, & wickedest payne doo presse good
men, & yll doo snatch reward from vertue, I wonder much what may seeme
the reason of so vniust a confusion, BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.472

& doo desyre of the` to know.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.473

For lest wold I maruell therat, if I beleeued all thinges were mixt by
chanceing luck.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,89.474

Now, God the guide, my doute increasith; which when oft tymes he giues to
good, delytes, to euill hard haps, somtyme agayne he giues yll chance to
good, & grauntes the yll their wish, without ther <P_90> could a cause
be founde, what hit should be that makes a difference from chaunceing
haps. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,90.475

"It is no wonder,"quoth she,"if any thing rash & confounded be beleuid
when orders reason is vnknowen.  BOETHEL-E2-P2,90.476

But thou, allthough thou knowest not the cause of so greate an order,
yet because a good guyder the world tempers, doubte thou not all thinges
rightly orderd be. "{COM:verse_omitted} BOETHEL-E2-P2,90.477

Let vs beware lest following the common opinion we doo somthing vnawares.
BOETHEL-E2-P2,99.508

By this that we haue graunted we conclude that worsse is the state of
them that be eyther in the possibilitie, or in the aduaunce or obtayning
of vertue, and yet byde in their iniquitie. "BOETHEL-E2-P2,99.509

"This is true,"said I,"tho no man dare confesse it. " BOETHEL-E2-P2,99.510

"Wherfore,"said she,"so ought not a wise man beare with greefe, fortunes

For the hardnes is argument for bothe, eyther to inlarge his glory,
or to confirme his witt.  Wherby we call it force that stycking to his
