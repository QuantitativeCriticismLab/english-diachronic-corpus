<P_1,12V>

Surely <font> Salomon <$$font> hath pronounced it both in censure, <font>
Qui festinat ad diuitias non erit insons <$$font>; and in precept: <font>
Buy the truth, and sell it not: BACON-E2-P2,1,12V.2

and so of wisdome and knowledge <$$font>; iudging that meanes were
to be spent vpon learning, and not learning to be applyed to meanes:
BACON-E2-P2,1,12V.3

And as for the priuatenesse or obscurenesse <paren> as it may be in
vulgar estimation accounted <$$paren> of life of contemplatiue men;
it is a Theame so common, to extoll a priuate life, not taxed with
sensualitie and sloth in comparison, and to the disadvantage of a ciuile
life, for safety, libertie, pleasure and dignitie, or at least freedome
from indignitie, <P_1,13R> as no man handleth it, but handleth it well:
such a consonancie it hath to mens conceits in the expressing, and to
mens contents in the allowing: BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.4

this onely I will adde; that learned men forgotten in States, and not
liuing in the eyes of men, are like the Images of <font> Cassius <$$font>
and <font> Brutus <$$font> in the funerall of <font> Iunia <$$font>; of
which not being represented, as many others were <font> Tacitus <$$font>
sayth, <font> Eo ipso prefulgebant, quod non visebantur <$$font>.
BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.5

And for meanesse of employment, that which is most traduced to contempt
, is that the government of youth is commonly allotted to them, which
age, because it is the age of least authoritie, it is transferred to
the diseesteeming of those employments wherin youth is conuersant,
and which are conuersant about youth.  BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.6

But how vniust this traducement is, <paren> if you will reduce thinges
from popularitie of opinion to measure of reason <$$paren> may appeare
in that we see men are more curious what they put into a new Vessell,
than {COM:they_are_curious_about_what_they_put} into a Vessell seasoned
; and {COM:curious} what mould they lay about a young plant, than
{COM:they_are_curious_about_what_they_lay} about a Plant corroborate;
so as the weakest Termes and Times of all things vse to have the best
applications and helpes.  BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.7

And will you hearken to the Hebrew <font> Rabynes?  BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.8

Your young men shall see Visions, and your old men shal dreame dreames
<$$font>, say they BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.9

youth is the worthier age, for that Visions are neerer apparitions of God,
than dreames?  BACON-E2-P2,1,13R.10

And let it bee noted, that how soeuer the Conditions of life of <font>
Pedantes <$$font> hath been scorned upon Theaters, as the Ape of
Tyrannies <P_1,13V> and that the modern loosenes or negligence hath
taken no due regard to the choice of Schoolemasters, & tutors; yet the
ancient wisdome of the best times did alwaies make a iust complaint,
that States were too busie with their Lawes, and too negligent in point
of education: which excellent part of ancient discipline hath been
in some sort reuiued of late times, by the Colledges of the Iesuites:
of whom, although in regard of their superstition I maye say, <font>
Quo meliores, eo deteriores <$$font>, yet in regard of this, and some
other points concerning humane learning, and Morall matters, I may say
as <font> Agesilaus <$$font> sayd to his enemie <font> Parnabasius,
Talis quum sis, vtinam noster esses <$$font>.  BACON-E2-P2,1,13V.11

And thus much touching the discredits drawn from the fortunes of
learned men.  BACON-E2-P2,1,13V.12

As touching the Manners of learned men, it is a thing personall and
indiuiduall, BACON-E2-P2,1,13V.13

and no doubt there be amongst them, as in other professions, of all
temperatures; BACON-E2-P2,1,13V.14

but yet so as it is not without truth, which is sayd, that <font> Abeunt
studia in mores <$$font>, BACON-E2-P2,1,13V.15

Studies haue an influence and operation, vpon the manners of those that
are conuersant in them.  BACON-E2-P2,1,13V.16

But vpon an attentive, and indifferent reuiew; I for my part, $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} find any disgrace to learning, can proceed fro~ the manners
of learned men; not inherent to them as they are learned; except it be
a fault, <paren> which was the supposed fault of <font> Demosthenes,
Cicero, Cato <$$font> the second, <font> Seneca <$$font>, and many moe
<$$paren> that because the times they read of, are commonly better than
the times they live in and the duties taught, <P_1,14R> better than
the duties practised: They contend somtimes too farre, to bring thinges
to perfection; and to reduce the corruption of manners, to honestie of
precepts, or examples of too great height; BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.17

And yet hereof they have Caveats ynough in their owne walkes:
BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.18

For <font> Solon <$$font>, when he was asked whether he had given his
Citizens the best laws, answered wisely, <font> Yea of such, as they
would receive <$$font>: BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.19

and <font> Plato <$$font> finding that his owne heart, could not agree
with the corrupt manners of his Country, refused to beare place or office,
saying: <font> That a mans Countrey was to be vsed as his Parents were,
BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.20

that is, with humble perswasions, and not with contestations <$$font>.
BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.21

And <font> Caesars <$$font> Counsellor put in the same Caveat, <font>
Non ad vetera instituta reuoucans quae iampridem corruptis moribus
ludibrio sunt <$$font>; BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.22

and <font> Cicero <$$font> noteth this error directly in <font> Cato
<$$font> the second, when he writes to his friend <font> Atticus;
Cato optime sentit, sed nocet interdum reipublicae; loquitur enim
tanquam in repub: Platonis, non tanquam in faece Romuli <$$font>;
BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.23

and the <font> same Cicero <$$font> doth excuse and expound the
Philosophers for going too far, and being too exact in their prescripts ,
when he saith; <font> Isti ipsi praeceptores virtutis & Magisitr, videntur
fines officiorum paulo longius quam natura vellet protulisse , vt cu~
ad vltimu~ animo contendissemus, ibi tamen, vbi oportet, consisteremus
<$$font>: BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.24

and yet himself might have said: <font> Monitis su~ minor ipse meis
<$$font>, BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.25

for it was his own fault, thogh not in so extream a degre.
BACON-E2-P2,1,14R.26

Another fault likewise much of this kind, hath beene incident to learned
men; which is that they haue esteemed the preseruation, good, and honor
of <P_1,14V> their Countreys or Maisters before their owne fortunes
or safeties.  BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.27

For so sayth Demosthenes vnto the Athenians; <font> If it please you
to note it, my counsels unto you, are not such, whereby I should
grow great amongst you, and you become little among the Grecians:
BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.28

But they be of that nature as they are sometimes not good for me to giue
, BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.29

but are alwaies good for you to follow <$$font>.  BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.30

And so <font> Seneca <$$font> after he had consecrated that <font>
Quinquennium Neronis <$$font> to the eternall glorie of learned Governors,
held on his honest and loyall course of good and free Counsell, after his
Maister grew extreamely corrupt in his government; BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.31

neither can this point otherwise be: BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.32

for learning endueth mens mindes with a true sence of the frailtie of
their persons, the casualtie of their fortunes, and the dignitie of
their soule and vocation; so that it is impossible for them to esteeme
that any greatnesse of their owne fortune can bee, a true or worthy end
of their being and ordainment; BACON-E2-P2,1,14V.33

and therefore are desirous to giue their account to God, and so likewise
to their Maisters vnder God <paren> as Kinges and the States that they
serue <$$paren> in these words; <font> Ecce tibi lucrifeci <$$font>
, and not <font> Ecce mihi lucrifeci <$$font>: whereas the corrupter
sort of meere Politiques, that haue not their thoughts established by
learning in the loue and apprehension of dutie, nor neuer looke abroad
into vniuersalitie; doe referre all thinges to themselues, and thrust
themselues into the Center of the world, as if all lynes would meet in
them and their fortunes; neuer caring in all tempers what becoms of the
shippe of <P_1,15R> Estates, so they may saue themselues in the Cockeboat
of their owne fortune, whereas men that feele the weight of dutie, and
know the limits of selfeloue, vse to make good their places & duties,
though with perils.  BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.34

And if they stand in seditious and violent alterations; it is rather
the reuerence which many times both aduerse parts doe give to honestie,
than any versatile advantage of their owne carriage.  BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.35

But for this point of tender sence, and fast obligation of dutie, which
learning doth endue the minde withall, howsoeuer fortune may taxe it,
and many in the depth of their corrupt principles may despise it, yet
it will receive an open allowance, BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.36

and therefore needes the lesse disproofe or excusation.
BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.37

Another fault incident commonly to learned men, which may be more
probably defended, than truely denyed, is that they fayle sometimes in
applying themselus {COM:sic} to particular persons, which want of exact
application ariseth from two causes: BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.38

The one, because the largenesse of their minde can hardly confine it
selfe to dwell in the exquisite obseruation or examination of the nature
and customes of one person: BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.39

for it is a speech for a Louer, & not for a wise man: <font> Satis magnum
alter alteri Theatrum sumus <$$font>: BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.40

Neuerthelesse I shall yeeld, that he that $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
contract the light of his minde, aswell as disperse and dilate it,
wanteth a great facultie.  BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.41

But there is a second cause, which is no inabilitie, but a reiection
upon choise and iudgement, BACON-E2-P2,1,15R.42

For the honest and iust bounds of obseruation, by one person vpon another
, <P_1,15V> extend no further, but to vnderstand him suficiently, whereby
not to giue him offence, or wherby to be able to giue him faithfull
Counsel, or wherby to stand vpon reasonable guard and caution in respect
of a mans selfe: BACON-E2-P2,1,15V.43

But to be speculatiue into another man, to the end to know how to worke
him, or winde him, or gouerne him, proceedeth from a heart that is double
and clouen, and not entire and ingenuous; which as in friendship it is
want of integritie, so towards Princes or Superiors, is want of dutie.
BACON-E2-P2,1,15V.44

For the custome of the Leuant, which is, that subiects doe forbeare
to gaze or fixe their eyes vpon Princes, is in the outward Ceremonie
barbarous; BACON-E2-P2,1,15V.45

but the morall is good: BACON-E2-P2,1,15V.46

For men ought not by cunning and bent obseruations to pierce and
penetrate into the hearts of Kings, which the scripture hath declared
to be inscrutable.  BACON-E2-P2,1,15V.47

There is yet another fault <paren> with which I will conclude this
part <$$paren> which is often noted in learned men, that they doe many
times fayle to obserue decencie, and discretion in their behauiour and
carriage; and commit errors in small and ordinarie points of action;
so as the vulgar sort of Capacities, doe make a Judgement of them in
greater matters, by that which they finde wanting in them, in smaller.
BACON-E2-P2,1,15V.48

But this consequence doth oft deceive men, for which, I doe referre them
ouer to that which was sayd by <font> Themistocles <$$font> arrogantly
and vnciuily, being applyed to himselfe out of his owne mouth, but being
applyed to the generall state of this question pertinently <P_1,16R>
and iustly; when being invited to touch a Lute, he sayd: <font> He could
not fiddle, but he could make a small Towne, a great state <$$font>.
BACON-E2-P2,1,16R.49

So no doubt, many may be well seene in the passages of gouernement
and policies which are to seeke in little, and punctuall occasions;
BACON-E2-P2,1,16R.50

I referre them also to that, which <font> Plato <$$font> sayd of his
Maister <font> Socrates <$$font>, whom he compared to the Gallypots of
Apothecaries, which on the out side had Apes and Owles, and Antiques,
but contained with in soueraigne and precious liquors, and confections;
acknowledging that to an externall report, he was not without superficiall
leuities, and deformitie; but was inwardly replenished with excellent
vertues and powers.  BACON-E2-P2,1,16R.51

And so much touching the point of menners of learned men.
BACON-E2-P2,1,16R.52

But in the meane time, I have no purpose to giue allowance to some
conditions and courses base, and unworthy, wherein divers Professors
of learning, have wronged themselues, and gone too farre; such as were
those Trencher Philosophers, which in the later age of the Romane State,
were vsually in the houses of great persons, being little better than
solemne Parasites; of which kinde, <font> Lucian <$$font> maketh a
merrie description of the Philosopher that the great Ladie tooke to
ride with her in her Coach, and would needs have him carie her little
Dogge which he doing officiously, and yet vncomely, the Page scoffed,
and sayd: <font> That he doubted, the Philosopher of a Stoike, would
turne to be a Cynike <$$font>.  BACON-E2-P2,1,16R.53

But above all the rest, the grosse and palpable flatterie, whereunto
<P_1,16V> many <paren> not vnlearned <$$paren> haue abbased & abused
their wits and pens, turning <paren> as <font> Du Bartas <$$font> saith,
<$$paren> <font> Hecuba <$$font> into <font> Helena <$$font>, and <font>
Faustina <$$font> into <font> Lucretia <$$font>, hath most diminished
the price and estimation of Learning BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.54

Neither is the morall dedications of Bookes and Writings, as to Patrons
to bee commended: for that Bookes <paren> such as are worthy the name
of Bookes <$$paren> ought to have no Patrons, but Truth and Reason:
BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.55

and the ancient custome was, to dedicate them only to priuate and equall
friendes, or to intitle the Bookes with their Names, BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.56

or if to Kings and great persons, it was to some such as the argument
of the Booke was fit and proper for; BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.57

but these and the like Courses may deserue rather reprehension, than
defence.  BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.58

Not that I can taxe or condemne the morigeration or application of
learned men to men in fortune.  BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.59

For the answere was good that <font> Diogenes <$$font> made to one that
asked him in mockerie, <font> How it came to be that Philosophers were
the followers of rich men, and not rich men of Philosophers?  <$$font>
BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.60

He answered soberly, and yet sharpely; <font> Because the one sort knew
what they had need of, & the other did not <$$font>; BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.61

And of the like nature was the answere which <font> Aristippus
<$$font> made, when hauing a petition to <font> Dionisius <$$font>,
and no eare giuen to him, he fell downe at his feete, wheupon <font>
Dionisius <$$font> stayed, and gaue him the hearing, and graunted it,
BACON-E2-P2,1,16V.62

and afterward some person tender on the behalfe {of} Philosophie,
reprooued <font> Aristippus <$$font>, that he would offer the Profession
of Philosophie such an indignitie; <P_1,17R> as for a priuat Suit to
fall at a Tyrants feet: BACON-E2-P2,1,17R.63

But he answered; <font> It was not his fault, BACON-E2-P2,1,17R.64

but it was the fault of Dionisius, that had his eares in his feete
<$$font>.  BACON-E2-P2,1,17R.65

Neither was it accounted weakenesse, but discretion in him that would
not dispute his best with <font> Adrianus Caesar <$$font>; excusing
himselfe, <font> That it was reason to yeeld to him, that commaunded
thirtie Legions <$$font>.  BACON-E2-P2,1,17R.66

These and the like applications and stooping to points of necessitie and
conuenience $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bee disallowed: BACON-E2-P2,1,17R.67

for though they may haue some outward basenesse; yet in a Iudgement
truely made, they are to bee accounted submissions to the occasion,
and not to the person.  BACON-E2-P2,1,17R.68

{COM:insert_helsinki_1}

<P_1,23V>

The first of these is the extreame affecting of two extreamities ; The
one Antiquity, The other Nouelty; wherein it seemeth the children of time
doe take after the nature and mallice of the father.  BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.71

For as he deuowreth his children; so one of them seeketh to deuoure and
suppresse the other; BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.72

while Antiquity enuieth there should be new additions,
BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.73

and Nouelty; $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be content to add,
BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.74

but it must deface; BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.75

Surely the aduise of the Prophet is the true direction in this matter ,
<font> State super vias antiquas, & videte quaenam sit via recta & bona,
& ambulate in ea.  <$$font> BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.76

Antiquity deserueth that reuere~ce, that men should make a stand
thereupon, and discouer what is the best way, BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.77

but when the discouery is well taken then to make progression.
BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.78

And to speake truly, <font> Antiquita seculi Iuuentus Mundi.  <$$font>
BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.79

These times are the ancient times when the world is ancient, & not
those which we count ancient <font> Ordine retrogrado, <$$font> by a
computacion backward from our selues.  BACON-E2-P2,1,23V.80

Another Error induced by the former is a distrust that any thing should
bee now to bee found out <P_1,24R_misnumbered_as_34R> which the world
should haue missed and passed ouer so long time, if the same obiection
were to be made to time, that <font> Lucian <$$font> maketh to <font>
Iupiter <$$font>, and other the heathen Gods, of which he woondreth ,
that they begot so many Children in old time, and begot none in his time,
and asketh whether they were become septuagenarie, or whether the lawe
<font> Pappia <$$font> made against old mens mariages had restrayned them.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24R_misnumbered_as_34R.81

So it seemeth men doubt, least time is become past children and
generation; wherein contrary wise, we see commonly the leuitie
and vnconstancie of mens iudgements, which till a matter bee done,
woonder againe that it was no sooner done, as we see in the expedition
of <font> Alexander <$$font> into <font> Asia <$$font>, which at
first was preiudged as a vast and impossible enterprize; and yet
afterwards it pleseth <font> Liuye <$$font> to make no more of it,
than this, <font> Nil aliud quam bene ausus vana contemnere.  <$$font>
BACON-E2-P2,1,24R_misnumbered_as_34R.82

And the same happened to <font> Columbus <$$font> in the westerne
Nauigation.  BACON-E2-P2,1,24R_misnumbered_as_34R.83

But in intellectual matters, it is much more common; as may be seen
in most of the propositions of <font> Euclyde <$$font>, which till
they bee demonstrate, they seeme strange to our assent; but being
demonstrate, our mind accepteth of them by a kind of relation <paren>
as the Lawyers speak <$$paren> as if we had knowne them before.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24R_misnumbered_as_34R.84

Another Errour that hath also some affinitie with the former is a
conceit that of former opinions or sects after varietie and examination
, the best hath still preuailed; and suppressed the rest; So as if a
<P_1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V> man should beginne the labour of a newe
search, hee were but like to light vppon somewhat formerly reiected; and
by reiection, brought into obliuion; as if the multitude, or the wisest
for the multitudes sake, were not readie to giue passage, rather to that
which is popular and superficial, than to that which is substantiall
and profound; BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.85

for the truth is, that time seemeth to be of the nature of a Riuer,
or streame, which carryeth downe to vs that which is light and blowne
vp; and sinketh and drowneth that which is weightie and solide.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.86

Another Errour of a diuerse nature from all the former, is the ouer-early
and peremptorie reduction of knowledge into Arts and Methodes: from
which time, commonly Sciences receiue small or no augmentation.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.87

But as young men, when they knit and shape perfectly, doe seldome grow to
a further stature: so knowledge, while it is Aphorismes and obseruations,
it is in groweth; BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.88

but when it once is comprehended in exact Methodes; it may perchance be
further pollished and illustrate, and accommodated for vse and practise ;
BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.89

but it encreaseth no more in bulke and substance.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.90

Another Errour which doth succeed that which we last mentioned, is
, that after the distribution of particular Arts and Sciences, men
haue abandoned vniuersalitie, or <font> Philosophia prima <$$font>;
which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} but cease, and stoppe all progression.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.91

For no perfect discouerie can bee made vppon a flatte, or a leuell.
BACON-E2-P2,1,24V_misnumbered_as_34V.92

<P_1,25R>

Neither is it possible to discouer the more remote, and deeper parts
of any Science, if you stand but vpon the leuell of the same Science,
and ascend not to a higher Science.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25R.94

Another Error hath proceeded from too great a reuerence, and a kinde of
adoration of the minde and vnderstanding of man: by meanes whereof, men
haue withdrawne themselues too much from the contemplation of Nature ,
and the obseruations of experience: and haue tumbled vp and downe in
their owne reason and conceits: BACON-E2-P2,1,25R.95

vpon these Intellectuallists, which are notwithstanding commonly
taken for the most sublime and diuine Philosophers; <font> Heraclitus
<$$font> gaue a iust censure, saying: <font> Men sought truth in their
owne little worlds, and not in the great and common world: <$$font>
BACON-E2-P2,1,25R.96

for they disdaine to spell, and so by degrees to read in the volume of
Gods works, BACON-E2-P2,1,25R.97

and contrarywise by continuall meditation and agitation of wit, doe vrge,
and as it were inuocate their owne spirits, to diuine, and giue Oracles
vnto them, whereby they are deseruedly deluded.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25R.98

Another Error that hath some connexion with this later, is, that men
haue vsed to infect their meditations, opinions, and doctrines with some
conceits which they haue most admired, or some Sciences which they haue
most applyed; and giuen all things else a tincture according to them,
vtterly vntrue and vnproper.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25R.99

So hath <font> Plato <$$font> intermingled his Philosophie with Theologie
, and <font> Aristotle <$$font> with Logicke, and the second Schoole of
<font> Plato <$$font>, <P_1,25V> <font> Proclus <$$font>, and the rest,
with the Mathematiques.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.100

For these were the Arts which had a kinde of <font> Primo geniture
<$$font> with them seuerally.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.101

So haue the Alchymists made a Philosophie out of a few experiments of
the Furnace; BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.102

and <font> Gilbertus <$$font> our Countrey man hath made a Philosophie
out of the obseruations of a Loadstone.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.103

So <font> Cicero <$$font>, when reciting the seuerall opinions of the
nature of the soule, he found a Musician, that held that the soule was
but a harmonie, BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.104

sayth pleasantly: <font> Hic ab arte sua non recessit, &c.  <$$font>
BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.105

But of these conceits <font> Aristotle <$$font> speaketh seriously
and wisely, when he sayth: <font> Qui respiciunt ad pauca de facili
pronuntiant.  <$$font> BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.106

Another Errour is an impatience of doubt, and hast to assertion without
due and mature suspention of iudgement.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.107

For the two wayes of contemplation are not vnlike the two wayes of action
, commonly spoken of by the Ancients.  The one plain and smooth in the
beginning, and in the end impassable; the other rough and troublesome
at the entrance, but after a while fair and euen, BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.108

so it is in cotemplation, BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.109

if a man will begin with certainties, hee shall end in doubts;
BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.110

but if he will be content to beginne with doubts, he shall end in
certainties.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.111

Another Error is in the manner of the tradition and deliuerie of
knowledge, which is for the most part Magistrall and peremptorie; and
not ingenuous and faithfull, in a sort, as may be soonest beleeued;
and not easilest examined.  BACON-E2-P2,1,25V.112

It is true, that in compendious Treatises for practise, that fourme is
<P_1,26R> not to bee disallowed.  BACON-E2-P2,1,26R.113

But in the true handling of knowledge, men ought not to fall either on
the one side into the veyne of <font> Velieius <$$font> the Epicurean:
<font> Nil tam metuens, quam ne dubitare aliqua de re videretur <$$font>
; Nor on the other side into <font> Socrates <$$font> his irronicall
doubting of all things, but to propound things sincerely, with more or
lesse asseueration: as they stand in a mans owne iudgement, prooued more
or lesse.  BACON-E2-P2,1,26R.114

Other Errors there are in the scope that men propound to themselues,
whereunto they bend their endeauours: BACON-E2-P2,1,26R.115

for whereas the more constant and deuote kind of Professors of any science
ought to propound to themselues, to make some additions to their Science;
they conuert their labours to aspire to certaine second Prizes; as to be
a profound Interpreter or Com~enter; to be a sharpe Champion or Defender;
to be a methodicall Compounder or abridger; BACON-E2-P2,1,26R.116

and so the Patrimonie of knowledge commeth to be sometimes improoued
but seldome augmented.  BACON-E2-P2,1,26R.117

But the greatest Error of all the rest, is the mistaking or misplacing
of the last or furthest end of knowledge: BACON-E2-P2,1,26R.118

for men haue entred into a desire of Learning and knowledge, sometimes
vpon a naturall curiositie, and inquisitiue appetite: sometimes to
entertaine their mindes with varietie and delight; sometimes for ornament
and reputation; and sometimes to inable them to victorie of wit and
contradiction, and most times for lukar and profession, and seldome
sincerely to giue a true account of their <P_1,26V> guift of reason,
to the benefite and vse of men: As if there were sought in knowledge a
Cowch, wherevpon to rest a searching and restlesse spirite; or a tarrasse
for a wandring and variable minde, to walke vp and downe with a faire
prospect; or a Tower of State for a proude minde to raise it selfe vpon;
or a Fort or commaunding ground for strife and contention, or a Shoppe
for profite or sale; and not a rich Store-house for the glorie of the
Creator, and the reliefe of Mans estate.  BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.119

But this is that, which will indeed dignifie and exalt knowledge; if
contemplation and action may be more neerely and straightly conioyned
and vnited together, than they haue beene; a Coniunction like vnto that
of the two highest Planets, <font> Saturne <$$font> the Planet of rest
and contemplation; and <font> Iupiter <$$font> the Planet of ciuile
societie and action.  BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.120

Howbeit, I doe not meane when I speake of vse and action, that end
before mentioned of the applying of knowledge to luker and profession;
BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.121

For I am not ignorant howe much that diuerteth and interrupteth the
prosecution and aduauncement of knowledge; like vnto the goulden ball
throwne before <font> Atalanta <$$font>, which while shee gooth aside,
and stoopeth to take vp, the race is hindred, BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.122

<font> Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit: <$$font>
BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.123

Neither is my meaning as was spoken of <font> Socrates <$$font>,
to call Philosophy down from heaue~ to conuerse vpon the earth,
BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.124

that is, to leaue natural Philosophy aside, & to applye knowledge onely
to manners, and policie.  BACON-E2-P2,1,26V.125

<P_1,27R>

But as both heauen and earth doe conspire and contribute to the vse
and benefite of man: So the end ought to bee from both Philosophies,
to separate and reiect vaine speculations, and whatsoeuer is emptie
and voide, and preserue and augment whatsoeuer is solide and fruitfull:
that knowledge may not bee as a Curtezan for pleasure, & vanitie only,
or as a bond-woman to acquire and gaine to her Masters vse, but as a
Spouse, for generation, fruit, and comfort.  BACON-E2-P2,1,27R.127

Thus haue I described and opened as by a kinde of dissection, those
peccant humors <paren> the principall of them <$$paren> which hath not
onely giuen impediment to the proficience of Learning, but haue giuen
also occasion, to the traducement thereof: wherein if I haue beene too
plaine, it must bee remembred; <font> Fidelia vulnera amantis, sed dolosa
oscula malignantis.  <$$font> BACON-E2-P2,1,27R.128

This I thinke I haue gained, that I ought to bee the better beleeued
, in that which I shall say pertayning to commendation: because
I haue proceeded so freely, in that which concerneth censure.
BACON-E2-P2,1,27R.129

And yet I haue no purpose to enter into a laudatiue of Learning, or to
make a Hymne to the Muses <paren> though I am of opinion, that it is long
since their Rites were duely celebrated <$$paren> BACON-E2-P2,1,27R.130

but my intent is without varnish or amplification, iustly to weigh the
dignitie of knowledge in the balance with other things, and to take
the true value thereof by testimonies and arguments diuine, and humane.
BACON-E2-P2,1,27R.131

First therefore, let vs seeke the dignitie of knowledge <P_1,27V> in the
Arch-tipe or first plat forme, which is {TEXT:is_is} in the attributes and
acts of God, as farre as they are reuealed to man, and may be obserued
with sobrietie, wherein we may not seeke it by the name of Learning,
BACON-E2-P2,1,27V.132

for all learning is knowledge acquired, BACON-E2-P2,1,27V.133

and all knowledge in God is originall.  BACON-E2-P2,1,27V.134

And therefore we must looke for it by another name, that of wisedome or
sapience, as the scriptures call it.  BACON-E2-P2,1,27V.135

It is so then, that in the worke of the Creation, we see a double
emanation of vertue fro~ God: the one referring more properly to power
, the other to wisedome, the one expressed in making the subsistence
of the mater, & the other in disposing the beauty of the fourme.
BACON-E2-P2,1,27V.136

This being supposed, it is to bee obserued, that for any thing which
appeareth in the historie of the Creation, the confused Masse, and matter
of heauen and earth was made in a moment, and the order and disposition
of that <font> Chaos <$$font> or Masse, was the work of sixe dayes, such
a note of difference it pleased God to put vppon the workes of power,
and the workes of wisedome: wherewith concurreth that in the former, it
is not sette downe, that God sayd, <font> Let there be Heauen and Earth
<$$font>, as it is set downe of the workes following, but actually, that
God made Heauen and earth: the one carrying the stile of a Manufacture,
and the other of a lawe, decree, or Councell.  BACON-E2-P2,1,27V.137

To proceede to that which is next in order from God to spirits: we
finde as farre as credite is to bee giuen to the celestiall Hierarchye
, of that supposed <P_1,28R> <font> Dionysius <$$font> the Senator of
Athens the first place or degree is giuen to the Angels of loue, which
are termed <font> Seraphim <$$font>, the second to the Angels of light,
which are termed <font> Cherubim <$$font>, and the third; and so following
places to thrones, principalities, and the rest, which are all Angels of
power and ministry; so as the Angels of knowledge and illumination, are
placed before the Angels of Office and domination.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28R.138

To descend from spirits and intellectuall formes to sensible and materiall
fourmes, wee read the first fourme that was created, was light, which
hath a relation and correspondence in nature and corporall thinges,
to knowledge in spirits and incorporall thinges.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28R.139

So in the distribution of dayes, we see the day wherin God did rest, &
conte~plate his owne works, was blessed aboue all the dayes, wherein he
did effect and accomplish them.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28R.140

After the Creation was finished, it is sette downe vnto vs, that man was
placed in the Garden to worke therein, which worke so appointed to him,
could be no other than the worke of contemplation, BACON-E2-P2,1,28R.141

that is, when the end of worke is but for exercise and experiment,
not for necessitie, BACON-E2-P2,1,28R.142

for there being then no reluctation of the creature, nor sweat of the
browe, mans employment must of consequence haue ben matter of delight in
the experiment and not matter of labor for the vse.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28R.143

Againe the first Acts which man perfourmed in Paradise, <P_1,28V>
consisted of the two summarie parts of knowledge, the view of Creatures,
and the imposition of names.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28V.144

As for the knowledge which induced the fall, it was, as was touched
before, not the naturall knowledge of Creatures, but the morall knowledge
of good and euill, wherein the supposition was, that Gods commaundements
or prohibitions were not the originals of good and euill, but that
they had other beginnings which man aspired to know, to the end, to
make a totall defection from God, and to depend wholy vpon himselfe.
BACON-E2-P2,1,28V.145

To passe on, in the first euent or occurrence after the fall of Man;
we see <paren> as the Scriptures haue infinite Mysteries, not violating
at all the truth of the Storie or letter <$$paren> an Image of the
two Estates, the Contemplatiue state, and the actiue state, figured
in the two persons of <font> Abell <$$font> and <font> Cain <$$font>
, and in the two simplest and most primitiue Trades of life: that of
the Shepheard <paren> who by reason of his leasure, rest in a place,
and liuing in view of heauen, is a liuely Image of a contemplative life
<$$paren> and that of the husbandman; where we see againe, the fauour
and election of God went to the Shepheard, and not to the tiller of
the ground.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28V.146

So in the age before the floud, the holy Records within those few
memorials, which are there entred and registred, haue vouchsafed to
mention, and honour the name of the Inuentors and Authors of Musique,
and works in mettall.  BACON-E2-P2,1,28V.147

In the age after the Floud, the first great iudgement of God vppon the
<P_1,29R> ambition of man, was the confusion of tongues; whereby the open
Trade and intercourse of Learning and knowledge, was chiefely imbarred.
BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.148

To descend to <font> Moyses <$$font> the Law giuer, and Gods first penne
; hee is adorned by the Scriptures with this addition, and commendation:
<font> That he was seene in all the Learning of the AEgyptians <$$font>
; which Nation we know was one of the most ancient Schooles of the world
: BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.149

for, so <font> Plato <$$font> brings in the Egyptian Priest, saying vnto
<font> Solon: You Grecians are euer Children, BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.150

you haue no knowledge of antiquitie, nor antiquitie of knowledge.
<$$font> BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.151

Take a view of the ceremoniall law of <font> Moyses <$$font>; you shall
find besides the prefiguration of Christ, the badge or difference of
the people of God, the excercise and impression of obedience, and other
diuine vses and fruits thereof, that some of the most learned <font>
Rabynes <$$font> haue trauailed profitably, and profoundly to obserue,
some of them a naturall, some of them a morall sence, or reduction of
many of the ceremonies and ordinances: As in the lawe of the Leprousie,
where it is sayd: <font> If the whitenesse haue ouerspread the flesh,
the Patient may passe abroad for clean; BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.152

But if there be any whole flesh remayning, he is to be shut vp for
vncleane: <$$font> BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.153

One of them noteth a principle of nature, that putrefaction is more
contagious before maturitie than after: BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.154

And another noteth a position of moral Philosophie, that men abandoned
to vice, doe not so much corrupt manners, as those that are halfe good,
and halfe euill, BACON-E2-P2,1,29R.155

so, in this and verie many other places in that lawe, there is to
bee found besides <P_1,29V> the Theologicall sence, much aspersion
of Philosophie.  BACON-E2-P2,1,29V.156

So likewise in that excellent Booke of <font> Iob <$$font>, if it be
reuolued with diligence, it will be found pregnant, and swelling with
naturall Philosophie; as for example, Cosmographie, and the roundnesse
of the world: <font> Qui extendit aquilonem super vacuum, & appendit
terram super nihilum <$$font>: wherein the pensilenesse of the earth,
the pole of the North, and the finitenesse, or conuexitie of Heauen are
manifestly touched.  BACON-E2-P2,1,29V.157

So again matter of Astronomie; <font> Spiritus eius ornauit caelos
& obstetricante manu eius eductus est coluber tortuosus <$$font>:
BACON-E2-P2,1,29V.158

And in another place, <font> Nunquid coniungere valebis micantes stellas
pleyadas, aut gyrum arcturi poteris dissipare?  <$$font> where the fixing
of the starres, euer standing at equall distance, is with great elegancie
noted: BACON-E2-P2,1,29V.159

And in another place, <font> Qui facit arcturum, & oriona, & hyadas
, & interiora austri <$$font>, where againe hee takes knowledge of
the depression of the Southerne pole, calling it the secrets of the
South, because the southerne starres were in that climate vnseene.
BACON-E2-P2,1,29V.160

<P_2,1R>

The Second Book of Francis Bacon; of the proficience of aduancement of
Learning, Diuine and Humane.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1R.162

To the King.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1R.163

It might seeme to haue more conuenience, though it come often otherwise
to passe, <paren> Excellent King <$$paren> that those which are fruitfull
in their generations, & haue in themselues the foresight of Immortalitie ,
in their descendents, should likewise be more carefull of the good estate
of future times; vnto which they know they must transmitte and commend
ouer their dearest pledges.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1R.164

Queene <font> Elizabeth <$$font> was a soiourner in the world in respect
of her vnmaried life: BACON-E2-P2,2,1R.165

and was a blessing to her owne times; & yet so as the impression of her
good gouernement, besides her happie <P_2,1V> memorie, is not without
some efect, which doth suruiue her.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.166

But to your Maiestie, whom God hath alreadie blessed with so much Royall
issue, worthie to continue and represent you for euer: and whose youthfull
and fruitfull bedde doth yet promise manie the like renouations: It is
proper and agreeable to be conuersant, not only in the transitory parts
of good gouernment: but in those acts also, which are in their nature
permanent & perpetuall.  Amongst the which <paren> if affection do
not transport mee, <$$paren> there is not any more worthie, then the
further endowement of the world with sound and fruitfull knowledge:
BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.167

For why should a fewe receiued Authors stand vp like <font> Hercules
Columnes <$$font>, beyond which, there should be no sayling, or
discouering, since wee haue so bright and benigne a starre, as your Ma:
to conduct and prosper vs?  BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.168

To returne therefore where wee left, it remaineth to consider of what
kind those Acts are which haue bene vndertaken, & performed by Kings and
others, for the increase and aduancement of learning, wherein I purpose
to speake actiuely without digressing or dylating.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.169

Let this ground therfore be layd, that all workes are ouerco~men by
amplitude of reward, by soundnesse of direction, and by the coniunction
of labors.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.170

The first multiplyeth endeuour, BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.171

the second preuenteth error, BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.172

and the third supplieth the frailty of man.  BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.173

But the principal of these is direction: BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.174

for <font> Claudus in via, antevertit cursorem extra viam <$$font> :
BACON-E2-P2,2,1V.175

And <font> Salomon <$$font> excellently setteth it downe; <font> If the
Iron be not sharpe, <P_2,2R> it requireth more strength: But wisedome is
that which preuaileth: <$$font> signifying that the Inuention or election
of the Meane, is more effectuall then anie inforcement of accumulation
of endeuours.  BACON-E2-P2,2,2R.176

This I am induced to speake; for that <paren> not derogating from the
noble intention of any that haue beene deseruers towards the State of
learning <$$paren> I do obserue neuerthelesse, that their workes and
Acts are rather matters of Magnificence and Memorie, then of progression
and proficience, and tende rather to augment the masse of Learning in
the multitude of learned men, then to rectifie or raise the Sciences
themselues.  BACON-E2-P2,2,2R.177
