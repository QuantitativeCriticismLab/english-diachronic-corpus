Sweette Harte, I nowe begin to thinke my selfe in London, But so to
thinke on it, as I wish my selfe hartely at home againe at little Thorpe
in thy pretty little Armes.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.3

My busines, I hope, $will $be {TEXT:wilbe} at a good periode this weeke
, if I can finde my Lo: Keeper at some convenient Leisuer to Attend him
about my Tower busines.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.4

I have nowe found out all ther cheating plotts, which weare no more then
I have formerly susspected, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.5

And had not my Lo Keepers integritye binn Above ther honesty, I had been
Long since Quitt of that office.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.6

But nowe I am in some hopes that my Lo: Keeper will make good
the olde pattent, And so that I may have it in statue quo prius.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.7

My other busines with my greate Adversarye, I thinke, will have an end
with his Life, which thay say $can $not {TEXT:cannot} continue Long, he
Liing at this instant very weake & full of disseases besides olde age.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.8

My best intelligence of his estate is from his Apothecarye, who comes
every day to my cosin Knyvett, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.9

And he sweares he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hould out because his spirritts
are much spent.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.10

Christian charitye bindes me to praye for his good passage into another
world, And the best way, which I praye God I may really and truly
performe, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.11

But I thinke I shall not hurt my selfe with to much mourninge for him,
goe when he will.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.12

My Lady yor mother, I thanke God, is very well and cheerly,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.13

but keepes her chamber because of the Bitter weather that hath been.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.14

I hope she shall Long survive that old envioues fox that hath so much

KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.17

I was afraid I showld have been a Gossippe, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.18

but, I thanke them, ther is no such matter.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,86.19

The weather heer is nowe $abreaking, <P_87> so that over another weeke I
hope it $will $be {TEXT:wilbe} good travailing.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.20

Ther hath been, this frost, abundance of mischeefs
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.21

& many lost ther lifes aboute the Teames & elsewher.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.22

Thou hast made me proude of thy imploiements which $shall

KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.25

You must not exspecte no greate matters this time,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.26

for I knowe not howe my purss will hould out.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.27

Yet for thy comfort, I spend as little idlye as I can,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,87.28

And I thinke we keepe better houers heer, nowe my cosin is sicke, then

And Buried, I knowe not howe, in a farr better place then he deserved,

All the Judges & a greate many of emptye coaches Accompanied him with

He hath made 4 executioners of his Testament, vidz. Judge Hutton,

KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,88.65

I can tell you, since I writt last, I have had my Lo: Keeper by thee

KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,88.67

But yet I $can $nott {TEXT:cannott} get my Pattent sealed,

Deere Harte, I exspected this day to have had a returne of some good
newes of yor wellfares at Quidd'nham, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.200

but I heare that letters are intercepted & the post arreasted by the way,
so that I feare yo=r= letters are amongst them.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.201

Howesoever I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} but write the faithfull tender
of my affection to thee, hopeing I shall finde some trusty messenger
to convaye my love, althoughe but a day before I bringe it my selfe.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.202

My only staye nowe is to see howe it will please God to deale with my
cosin Knyvett, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.203

for in my Judgment he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} subsist many dayes.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.204

All o=r= good hopes of him are within these 2 dayes utterly dasht,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.205

& this very day his Phisitions, which weare 3 in number, had a meeting
of consultation aboute him, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.206

& hath given him over & set him at Liberty to eate or drinke what he
will or can, which is Just nothing.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.207

He hath a continuall scoureing, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.208

& that with a great deale of tormenting paine, which hath made
him very impatient $with $all {TEXT:withall} people aboute him,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.209

but as his spirritts decaye so he growes Quietter.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.210

God of his mercye comforte him.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.211

And nowe, sweet harte, let me tel you I would not for 500=l=.
but that I had made this Journye althouge {sic} it be chargeable to me.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.212

I tooke him in time, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.213

for he is nowe past discoursing of any busines.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.214

Yet, poore man, hath he neglected his owne estate so much as his will
is yet to perfect, which much troubles him although I veryly beleeve
his Inventory will not be greate.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.215

I hope my Landlord Elsing shall get into the office.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.216

He doth much Labore for it, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,92.217

& I doe wish with all <P_93> my harte he may obtaine it,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.218

for he is a very loving kind harted man, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.219

And suerly, if he gets it, we shall not want of a stowage whensoever we
have a minde to come to London.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.220

This day was ther made a younge Pegg, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.221

And I scap't not the vouchsafement of being a Gossipp for all my hopes.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.222

Well it is nowe past, KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.223

neither could I with civillitye & good mannors refuse, haveing been so
kindly intertaind heer, & no mony either for dyet or Lodging $will $be
{TEXT:wilbe} taken, so that I have ballancte that with a peece of plate
to my Goddaughter.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.224

For my partners you shall knowe them when I come.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.225

& my horsses, I thinke, $will $be {TEXT:wilbe} gone to morrowe,
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.230

& my coach must Lye Leed'ger heer, I thinke, till we come againe,
unless I meet with some handsome conveniencye of bringing of it downe.
KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.231

I have been so infinitlye perplext with my colde ever since I came that
I have had little Joy in going abroade.  KNYVETT-1630-E2-P2,93.234
