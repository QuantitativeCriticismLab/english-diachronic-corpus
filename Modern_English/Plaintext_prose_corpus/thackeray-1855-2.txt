Chapter LXVII THACKERAY-1855-2,700.3

<font> Newcome and Liberty <$$font> THACKERAY-1855-2,700.4

<$$heading>

We have said that the Baronet's lecture was discussed in the midnight
senate assembled at the'King's Arms,'where Mr Tom Potts showed the orator
no mercy.  THACKERAY-1855-2,700.6

The senate of the'King's Arms'was hostile to Sir Barnes Newcome.
THACKERAY-1855-2,700.7

Many other Newcomites besides were savage and inclined to revolt against
the representative of their borough.  THACKERAY-1855-2,700.8

As these patriots met over their cups, and over the bumper of
friendship uttered the sentiments of freedom, they had often asked of
one another, where should a man be found to rid Newcome of its dictator?
THACKERAY-1855-2,700.9

Generous hearts writhed under the oppression: THACKERAY-1855-2,700.10

patriotic eyes scowled when Barnes Newcome went by:
THACKERAY-1855-2,700.11

with fine satire, Tom Potts at Brown the $hatter $'s {TEXT:hatter's}
shop, who made the hats for Sir Barnes Newcome's domestics, proposed to
take one of the beavers - a gold-laced one with a cockade and a cord -
and set it up in the market-place and bid all Newcome come bow to it,
as to the hat of Gessler.  THACKERAY-1855-2,700.12

'$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you think, Potts,'says F. Bayham,
who of course was admitted into the'King's Arms'club, and ornamented
that assembly by his presence and discourse,'$do $n't {TEXT:don't} you
think the Colonel would make a good William Tell to combat against that
Gessler? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,700.13

Ha!  THACKERAY-1855-2,700.14

Proposal received with acclamation - THACKERAY-1855-2,700.15

eagerly adopted by Charles Tucker, Esquire, attorney-at-law, who would
not have the slightest objection to conduct Colonel Newcome's, or any
other gentleman's, electioneering business in Newcome or elsewhere.
THACKERAY-1855-2,700.16

Like those three gentlemen in the plays and pictures of William Tell ,
who conspire under the moon, calling upon liberty and resolving to elect
Tell as their especial champion - like Arnold, Melchthal, and Werner -
Tom Potts, Fred Bayham, and Charles Tucker, Esquires, conspired round
a punch-bowl, THACKERAY-1855-2,700.17

and determined that Thomas Newcome should be requested to free his
country.  THACKERAY-1855-2,700.18

A deputation from the electors of Newcome, that is to say, these very
gentlemen, waited on the Colonel in his apartment the very next morning
, THACKERAY-1855-2,700.19

and set before him the state of the borough; Barnes Newcome's tyranny
under which it groaned; and the yearning of all honest men to be free
from that usurpation.  THACKERAY-1855-2,700.20

Thomas Newcome received the deputation with great solemnity and politeness
, THACKERAY-1855-2,700.21

crossed his legs, THACKERAY-1855-2,700.22

folded his arms, THACKERAY-1855-2,700.23

smoked his <P_701> cheroot, THACKERAY-1855-2,701.24

and listened most decorously, as now Potts, now Tucker expounded to him;
Bayham giving the benefit of his emphatic'Hear hear'to their statements,
and explaining dubious phrases to the Colonel in the most affable manner.
THACKERAY-1855-2,701.25

Whatever the conspirators had to say against poor Barnes, Colonel Newcome
was only too ready to believe.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.26

He had made up his mind that that criminal ought to be punished and
exposed.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.27

The lawyer's covert innuendoes, who was ready to insinuate any amount
of evil against Barnes which could safely be uttered, were by no means
strong enough for Thomas Newcome.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.28

'"Sharp practice!  exceedingly alive to his own interests - reported
violence of temper and tenacity of money"- say swindling at once, sir,
THACKERAY-1855-2,701.29

- say falsehood and rapacity - THACKERAY-1855-2,701.30

say cruelty and avarice,'cries the Colonel - THACKERAY-1855-2,701.31

'I believe, upon my honour and conscience, that unfortunate young man
to be guilty of every one of those crimes. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,701.32

Mr Bayham remarks to Mr Potts that our friend the Colonel, when he
does utter an opinion, takes care there shall be no mistake about it.
THACKERAY-1855-2,701.33

'And I took care there should be no mistake before I uttered it at all,
Bayham! 'cries F. B.'s patron.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.34

'As long as I was in any doubt about this young man, I gave the criminal
the benefit of it, as a man who admires our glorious constitution should
do, THACKERAY-1855-2,701.35

and kept my own counsel, sir. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,701.36

'At least,'remarks Mr Tucker,'enough is proven to show that Sir Barnes
Newcome Newcome {COM:sic}, Baronet, is scarce a fit person to represent
this great borough in Parliament.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.37

'Represent Newcome in Parliament!  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.38

It is a disgrace to that noble institution the English House of Commons,
that Barnes Newcome should sit in it.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.39

A man whose word you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} trust; a man stained with
every private crime.  What right has he to sit in the assembly of the
legislators of the land, sir? 'cries the Colonel, waving his hand as if
addressing a chamber of deputies.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.40

'You are for upholding the House of Commons? 'inquires the lawyer.
THACKERAY-1855-2,701.41

'Of course, sir, of course. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,701.42

'And for increasing the franchise, Colonel Newcome, I should hope?
'continues Mr Tucker.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.43

'Every man who can read and write ought to have a vote, sir;
THACKERAY-1855-2,701.44

that is my opinion! 'cries the Colonel.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.45

'$He $'s {TEXT:He's} a Liberal to the backbone,'says Potts to Tucker.
THACKERAY-1855-2,701.46

'To the backbone! 'responds Tucker to Potts.  THACKERAY-1855-2,701.47

'The Colonel will do for us, Potts. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,701.48

'We want such a man, Tucker; THACKERAY-1855-2,701.49

the <font> Independent <$$font> has been crying out <P_702> for such a
man for years past.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.50

We ought to have a Liberal as second representative of this great
town - not a sneaking half-and-half Ministerialist like Sir Barnes
, a fellow with one leg in the Carlton and the other in Brooks's.
THACKERAY-1855-2,702.51

Old Mr Bunce we $can $n't {TEXT:can't} touch.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.52

His place is safe; THACKERAY-1855-2,702.53

he is a good man of business: THACKERAY-1855-2,702.54

we $can $n't {TEXT:can't} meddle with Mr Bunce - THACKERAY-1855-2,702.55

I know that, who know the feeling of the country pretty well.
'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.56

'Pretty well!  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.57

Better than any man in Newcome, Potts! 'cries Mr Tucker.
THACKERAY-1855-2,702.58

'But a good man like the Colonel, - a good Liberal like the Colonel, -
a man who goes in for household suffrage -'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.59

'Certainly, gentlemen. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.60

'And the general great Liberal principles - THACKERAY-1855-2,702.61

we know, of course - such a man would assuredly have a chance against
Sir Barnes Newcome at the coming election, could we find such a man -
a real friend of the people! 'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.62

'I know a friend of the people if ever there was one,'F. Bayham
interposes. 'A man of wealth, station, experience; a man who has fought
for his country; a man who is beloved in this place as <font> you <$$font>
are, Colonel Newcome: THACKERAY-1855-2,702.63

for your goodness is known, sir.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.64

- <font> You <$$font> are not ashamed of your origin,
THACKERAY-1855-2,702.65

and there is not a Newcomite old or young but knows how admirably
good you have been to your old friend, Mrs - Mrs What-d'you-call-'em?
'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.66

'Mrs Mason,'from F. B.'Mrs Mason.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.67

If such a man as you, sir, would consent to put himself in nomination
at the next election, every true Liberal in this place would rush to
support you; and crush the oligarch who rides over the liberties of this
borough! 'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.68

'Something of this sort, gentlemen, I own to you had crossed my mind,
'Thomas Newcome remarked.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.69

'When I saw that disgrace to my name, and the name of my father's
birthplace, representing the borough in Parliament, I thought for the
credit of the town and the family, the Member for Newcome at least might
be an honest man.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.70

I am an old soldier; THACKERAY-1855-2,702.71

have passed all my life in India; THACKERAY-1855-2,702.72

and am little conversant with affairs at home'THACKERAY-1855-2,702.73

<paren> cries of'You are, you are! '<$$paren>.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.74

'I hoped that my son, Mr Clive Newcome, might have been found qualified
to contest this borough against his unworthy cousin, and possibly to
sit as your representative in Parliament.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.75

The wealth I have had the good fortune to amass will descend to him
naturally, and at no very distant period of time, THACKERAY-1855-2,702.76

for I am nearly seventy years of age, gentlemen. ' THACKERAY-1855-2,702.77

The gentlemen are astonished at this statement.  THACKERAY-1855-2,702.78

<P_703>

'But,'resumed the Colonel,'my son Clive, as friend Bayham knows , and
to my own regret and mortification, as I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care to
confess to you, declares he has no interest in politics, nor desire for
public distinction - THACKERAY-1855-2,703.80

prefers his own pursuits - THACKERAY-1855-2,703.81

and even these I fear do not absorb him - THACKERAY-1855-2,703.82

declines the offer which I made him, to present himself in opposition
to Sir Barnes Newcome.  THACKERAY-1855-2,703.83

It becomes men in a certain station, as I think, to assert that station
; THACKERAY-1855-2,703.84

and though a few years back I never should have thought of public
life at all, and proposed to end my days in quiet as a retired dragoon
officer, since - since it has pleased Heaven to increase very greatly my
pecuniary means, to place me as a director and manager of an important
banking company, in a station of great public responsibility, I and my
brother directors have thought it but right that one of us should sit
in Parliament, if possible, THACKERAY-1855-2,703.85

and I am not a man to shirk from that or from any other duty. '
THACKERAY-1855-2,703.86

'Colonel, will you attend a meeting of electors which we will call, and
say as much to them and as well? 'cries Mr Potts.  THACKERAY-1855-2,703.87

'Shall I put an announcement in my paper to the effect that you are
ready to come forward? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,703.88

'I am prepared to do so, my good sir. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,703.89

And presently this solemn palaver ended.  THACKERAY-1855-2,703.90

Besides the critical article upon the Baronet's lecture, of which Mr
Warrington was the author, there appeared in the leading columns of the
ensuing number of Mr Potts'<font> Independent <$$font> some remarks
of a very smashing or hostile nature against the Member for Newcome.
THACKERAY-1855-2,703.91

'This gentleman has shown such talent in the lecturing business, 'the
<font> Independent <$$font> said,'that it is a great pity he should
not withdraw himself from politics, and cultivate what all Newcome
knows are the arts which he understands best; namely, poetry and the
domestic affections.  THACKERAY-1855-2,703.92

The performance of our talented representative last night was so
pathetic as to bring tears into the eyes of several of our fair friends.
THACKERAY-1855-2,703.93

We have heard, but never believed until now, that Sir Barnes Newcome
possessed such a genius <font> for making women cry <$$font>.
THACKERAY-1855-2,703.94

Last week we had the talented Miss Noakes from Slowcome, reading Milton
to us; THACKERAY-1855-2,703.95

how far superior was the eloquence of Sir Barnes Newcome
Newcome , Bart., even to that of the celebrated actress!
THACKERAY-1855-2,703.96

Bets were freely offered in the room last night that Sir Barnes would
<font> beat any woman <$$font>, - bets which were not taken, as we
scarcely need say, so well do our citizens appreciate the character of
our excellent, our admirable representative.  THACKERAY-1855-2,703.97

Let the Baronet stick to his lectures, THACKERAY-1855-2,703.98

and let Newcome relieve him of his political occupations.
THACKERAY-1855-2,703.99

He is not fit for them, THACKERAY-1855-2,703.100

he is too sentimental a man for us; THACKERAY-1855-2,703.101

the men of Newcome want a sound practical person; THACKERAY-1855-2,703.102

the <P_704> Liberals of Newcome have a desire to be represented.
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.103

When we elected Sir Barnes, he talked liberally enough,
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.104

and we thought he would do, THACKERAY-1855-2,704.105

but you see the honourable Baronet is so poetical!
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.106

we ought to have known that, and not to have believed him.
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.107

Let us have a straightforward gentleman.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.108

If not a man of words, at least let us have a practical man.
If not a man of eloquence, one at any rate whose word we can trust,
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.109

and we $can $n't {TEXT:can't} trust Sir Barnes Newcome's:
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.110

we have tried him, THACKERAY-1855-2,704.111

and we $can $n't {TEXT:can't} really.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.112

Last night, when the ladies were crying, we could not for the souls of
us help laughing.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.113

We hope we know how to conduct ourselves as gentlemen.
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.114

We trust we did not interrupt the harmony of the evening;
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.115

but Sir Barnes Newcome prating about children and virtue, and affection
and poetry, this is really too strong.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.116

'The <font> Independent <$$font>, faithful to its name, and ever actuated
by principles of honour, has been, as our thousands of readers know,
disposed to give Sir Barnes Newcome Newcome, Bart., a fair trial.
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.117

When he came forward after his father's death, we believed in his pledges
and promises, as a retrencher and reformer, THACKERAY-1855-2,704.118

and we stuck by him.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.119

Is there any man in Newcome, except, perhaps, our twaddling old
contemporary the <font> Sentinel <$$font>, who believes in Sir B.
N. any more?  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.120

We say no, THACKERAY-1855-2,704.121

and we now give the readers of the <font> Independent <$$font>, and
the electors of this borough, fair notice, that when the dissolution
of Parliament takes place, a good man, a true man, a man of experience
, no dangerous radical, or brawling tap orator - Mr Hicks's friends
well understand whom we mean - but a gentleman of Liberal principles,
well-won wealth, and deserved station and honour, will ask the electors
of Newcome whether they are or are not discontented with their present
unworthy Member.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.122

The <font> Independent <$$font>, for one, says, we know good men
of your family, we know in it men who would do honour to any name;
but you, Sir Barnes Newcome Newcome, Bart., we trust no more.
'THACKERAY-1855-2,704.123

In the electioneering matter, which had occasioned my unlucky
interference, and that subsequent little coolness upon the good Colonel's
part, Clive Newcome had himself shown that the scheme was not to his
liking; THACKERAY-1855-2,704.124

had then submitted as his custom was: THACKERAY-1855-2,704.125

and doing so with a bad grace, as also was to be expected, had got little
thanks for his obedience.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.126

Thomas Newcome was hurt at his son's faint-heartedness,
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.127

and of course little Rosey was displeased at his hanging back.
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.128

He set off in his father's train, a silent, unwilling partisan.
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.129

Thomas Newcome had the leisure to survey Clive's glum face opposite
to him during the whole of their journey, and to chew his mustachios,
and brood upon his wrath and wrongs.  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.130

His life had been a sacrifice for that boy!  THACKERAY-1855-2,704.131

What darling schemes had he not formed in his behalf,
THACKERAY-1855-2,704.132

and how superciliously <P_705> did Clive meet his projects!
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.133

The Colonel could not see the harm of which he had himself been the
author.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.134

Had he not done everything in mortal's power for his son's happiness,
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.135

and how many young men in England were there with such advantages as
this moody, discontented, spoiled boy?  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.136

As Clive backed out of the contest, of course his father urged it only
the more vehemently.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.137

Clive slunk away from committees and canvassing, THACKERAY-1855-2,705.138

and lounged about the Newcome manufactories, whilst his father, with
anger and bitterness in his heart, remained at the post of honour,
as he called it, bent upon overcoming his enemy and carrying his point
against Barnes Newcome.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.139

'If Paris will not fight, sir,'the Colonel said, with a sad look following
his son,'Priam must. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,705.140

Good old Priam believed his cause to be a perfectly just one,
and that duty and his honour called upon him to draw the sword.
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.141

So there was difference between Thomas Newcome and Clive his son.
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.142

I protest it is with pain and reluctance I have to write, that the good
old man was in error - that there was a wrong-doer, and that Atticus
was he.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.143

Atticus, be it remembered, thought himself compelled by the very best
motives.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.144

Thomas Newcome, the Indian banker, was at war with Barnes, the English
banker.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.145

The latter had commenced the hostilities, by a sudden and cowardly act
of treason.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.146

There were private wrongs to envenom the contest, THACKERAY-1855-2,705.147

but it was the mercantile quarrel on which the Colonel chose to set his
declaration of war.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.148

Barnes's first dastardly blow had occasioned it, THACKERAY-1855-2,705.149

and his uncle was determined to carry it through.
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.150

This I have said was also George Warrington's judgment, who in the
ensuing struggle between Sir Barnes and his uncle, acted as a very warm
and efficient partisan of the latter.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.151

'Kinsmanship! 'says George.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.152

'What has old Tom Newcome ever had from his kinsman but cowardice and
treachery?  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.153

If Barnes had held up his finger the young one might have been happy;
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.154

if he could have effected it, the Colonel and his bank would have
been ruined.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.155

I am for war, and for seeing the old boy in Parliament.
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.156

He knows no more about politics than I do about dancing the polka;
THACKERAY-1855-2,705.157

but there are five hundred wiseacres in that assembly who know no more
than he does, THACKERAY-1855-2,705.158

and an honest man taking his seat there, in place of a confounded little
rogue, at least makes a change for the better. ' THACKERAY-1855-2,705.159

I dare say Thomas Newcome, Esquire, would by no means have concurred in
the above estimate of his political knowledge, and thought himself as
well informed as another.  THACKERAY-1855-2,705.160

He used to speak with the greatest gravity about our constitution as
the pride and envy of the world, though he surprised you as much by the
latitudinarian reforms which he was eager to press forward, as by the most
singular old Tory <P_706> opinions which he advocated on other occasions.
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.161

He was for having every man to vote; every poor man to labour short time
and get high wages; every poor curate to be paid double or treble; every
bishop to be docked of his salary, and dismissed from the House of Lords.
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.162

But he was a staunch admirer of that assembly, and a supporter of the
rights of the Crown.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.163

He was for sweeping off taxes from the poor, THACKERAY-1855-2,706.164

and as money must be raised to carry on government, he opined that the
rich should pay.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.165

He uttered all these opinions with the greatest gravity and emphasis,
before a large assembly of electors and others convened in the Newcome
Town Hall, amid the roars of applause of the non-electors, and the
bewilderment and consternation of Mr Potts, of the <font> Independent
<$$font>, who had represented the Colonel in his paper as a safe and
steady reformer.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.166

Of course the <font> Sentinel <$$font> showed him up as a most dangerous
radical, a sepoy republican, and so forth, to the wrath and indignation
of Colonel Newcome.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.167

He a republican!  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.168

He scorned the name!  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.169

He would die as he had bled many a time for his Sovereign.
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.170

He an enemy of our beloved Church!  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.171

He esteemed and honoured it, as he hated and abhorred the superstitions
of Rome.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.172

<paren> Yells from the Irish in the crowd.  <$$paren>
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.173

He an enemy of the House of Lords!  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.174

He held it to be the safeguard of the constitution and the legitimate
prize of our most illustrious naval, military, and - and - legal heroes
<paren> ironical cheers <$$paren>.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.175

He repelled with scorn the dastard attacks of the journal which had
assailed him; THACKERAY-1855-2,706.176

he asked, laying his hand on his heart, if as a gentleman, an
officer bearing her Majesty's commission, he could be guilty of a
desire to subvert her empire and to insult the dignity of her crown?
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.177

After this second speech at the Town Hall, it was asserted by a
considerable party in Newcome, that Old Tom <paren> as the mob familiarly
called him <$$paren> was a Tory, while an equal number averred that he
was a Radical.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.178

Mr Potts tried to reconcile his statements, a work in which I should
think the talented editor of the <font> Independent <$$font> had no
little difficulty.  THACKERAY-1855-2,706.179

'He knows nothing about it,'poor Clive said with a sigh;
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.180

'his politics are all sentiment and kindness, THACKERAY-1855-2,706.181

he will have the poor man paid double wages, THACKERAY-1855-2,706.182

and does not remember that the employer would be ruined.
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.183

You have heard him, Pen, talking in this way at his own table;
THACKERAY-1855-2,706.184

but when he comes out armed <font> cap-a`-pie, <$$font> and careers
against windmills in public, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you see that as Don
Quixote's son I had rather the dear brave old gentleman was at home?
'THACKERAY-1855-2,706.185

So this <font> faine`ant <$$font> took but little part in the
electioneering doings, holding moodily aloof from the meetings, and
councils, and public-houses, where his father's partisans were assembled.

<font> A Letter and a Reconciliation <$$font> THACKERAY-1855-2,707.190

<$$heading>

Miss Ethel Newcome to Mrs Pendennis THACKERAY-1855-2,707.192

'Dearest Laura, - I have not written to you for many weeks past.
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.193

There have been some things too trivial, and some too sad, to write
about; some things I know I shall write of if I begin, and yet that I
know I had best leave; THACKERAY-1855-2,707.194

for of what good is looking to the past now?  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.195

Why vex you or myself by reverting to it?  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.196

Does not every day bring its own duty and task, THACKERAY-1855-2,707.197

and are these not enough to occupy one?  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.198

What a fright you must have had with my little goddaughter!
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.199

Thank Heaven she is well now and restored to you.
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.200

You and your husband I know do not think it essential;
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.201

but I do, <font> most essential <$$font>, THACKERAY-1855-2,707.202

and am very grateful that she was taken to church before her illness.
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.203

Is Mr Pendennis proceeding with his canvass?  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.204

I try THACKERAY-1855-2,707.205

and avoid a certain subject, THACKERAY-1855-2,707.206

but it <font> will <$$font> come.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.207

You know who is canvassing against us here.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.208

My poor uncle has met with very considerable success amongst the lower
classes.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.209

He makes them rambling speeches at which my brother and his friends laugh,
but which the people applaud.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.210

I saw him only yesterday, on the balcony of the"King's Arms,
"speaking to a great mob, who were cheering vociferously below.
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.211

I had met him before.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.212

He would not even stop and give his Ethel of old days his hand.
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.213

I would have given him I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what, for one kiss,
for one kind word: THACKERAY-1855-2,707.214

but he passed on THACKERAY-1855-2,707.215

and would not answer me.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.216

He thinks me - what the world thinks me, worldly and heartless; what I
<font> was <$$font>.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.217

But at least, dear Laura, you know that I always truly loved <font>
him <$$font>, and do now, although he is our enemy, though he believes
and utters the most cruel things against Barnes, though he says that
Barnes Newcome, my father's son, my brother, Laura, is not an honest man.
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.218

Hard, selfish, worldly, I own my poor brother to be,
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.219

and pray Heaven to amend him; THACKERAY-1855-2,707.220

but dishonest!  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.221

and to be so maligned by the person one loves best in the world!
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.222

This is a hard trial.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.223

I pray a proud heart may be bettered by it.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.224

And I have seen my cousin: once at a lecture which poor Barnes gave,
and who seemed very much disturbed on perceiving Clive; once afterwards
at good old Mrs Mason's, whom I have always continued to visit for
uncle's sake.  THACKERAY-1855-2,707.225

The poor old woman, whose wits are very nearly gone, held both our hands,
THACKERAY-1855-2,707.226

and asked when we were going to be married; THACKERAY-1855-2,707.227

and laughed, poor old <P_708> thing!  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.228

I cried out to her that Mr Clive had a wife at home,
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.229

a dear young wife, I said.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.230

He gave a dreadful sort of laugh, THACKERAY-1855-2,708.231

and turned away into the window.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.232

He looks terribly ill, pale, and oldened.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.233

I asked him a great deal about his wife, whom I remember a very pretty,
sweet-looking girl indeed, at my Aunt Hobson's, but with a not agreeable
mother, as I thought then.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.234

He answered me by monosyllables, THACKERAY-1855-2,708.235

appeared as though he would speak, THACKERAY-1855-2,708.236

and then became silent.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.237

I am pained, and yet glad that I saw him.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.238

I said, not very distinctly, I dare say, that I hoped the difference
between Barnes and uncle would not extinguish his regard for mamma and
me, who have always loved him; THACKERAY-1855-2,708.239

when I said loved him, he gave one of his bitter laughs again;
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.240

and so he did when I said I hoped his wife was well.
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.241

You never would tell me much about Mrs Newcome; THACKERAY-1855-2,708.242

and I fear she does not make my cousin happy.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.243

And yet this marriage was of my uncle's making: another of the unfortunate
marriages in our family.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.244

I am glad that I paused in time, before the commission of that sin;
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.245

I strive my best to amend my temper, my inexperience, my
shortcomings, and try to be the mother of my poor brother's children.
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.246

But Barnes has never forgiven me my refusal of Lord Farintosh.
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.247

He is of the world still, Laura.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.248

Nor must we deal too harshly with people of his nature, who $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} perhaps comprehend a world beyond.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.249

I remember in old days, when we were travelling on the Rhine, in
the happiest days of my whole life, I used to hear Clive, and his
friend Mr Ridley, talk of art and of nature in a way that I could not
understand at first, but came to comprehend better as my cousin taught
me; THACKERAY-1855-2,708.250

and since then, I see pictures, and landscapes, and flowers, with quite
different eyes, and beautiful secrets as it were, of which I had no
idea before.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.251

The secret of all secrets, the secret of the other life, and the
better world beyond ours, may not this be unrevealed to some?
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.252

I pray for them all, dearest Laura, for those nearest and dearest to me,
that the truth may lighten their darkness, and Heaven's great mercy defend
them in the perils and dangers of their night.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.253

My boy at Sandhurst has done very well indeed; THACKERAY-1855-2,708.254

and Egbert, am happy to say, thinks of taking orders:
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.255

he has been very moderate at College.  Not so Alfred;
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.256

but the Guards are a sadly dangerous school for a young man:
THACKERAY-1855-2,708.257

I have promised to pay his debts, THACKERAY-1855-2,708.258

and he is to exchange into the line.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.259

Mamma is coming to us at Christmas with Alice; THACKERAY-1855-2,708.260

my sister is very pretty indeed, I think, THACKERAY-1855-2,708.261

and I am rejoiced she is to marry young Mr Mumford, who has a tolerable
living, and who has been attached to her ever since he was a boy at
Rugby School.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.262

Little Barnes comes on bravely with his Latin; THACKERAY-1855-2,708.263

and Mr Whitestock, <font> a most excellent and valuable <$$font> person
in this place, where there is so much Romanism and Dissent, speaks highly
of him.  THACKERAY-1855-2,708.264

Little Clara is so like her unhappy mother in a thousand ways and actions
, that I am often shocked; and see my <P_709> brother starting back and
turning his head away, as if suddenly wounded.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.265

I have heard the most deplorable accounts of Lord and Lady Highgate.
THACKERAY-1855-2,709.266

O dearest friend and sister!  - save you, I think I scarce know any one
that is happy in the world: THACKERAY-1855-2,709.267

I trust you may continue so - you who impart your goodness and kindness
to all who come near you - you in whose sweet serene happiness I am
thankful to be allowed to repose sometimes.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.268

You are the island in the desert, Laura!  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.269

and the birds sing there, THACKERAY-1855-2,709.270

and the fountain flows; THACKERAY-1855-2,709.271

and we come THACKERAY-1855-2,709.272

and repose by you for a little while, THACKERAY-1855-2,709.273

and to-morrow the march begins again, and the toil, and the struggle,
and the desert.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.274

Goodbye fountain!  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.275

Whisper kisses to my dearest little ones for their affectionate Aunt
Ethel.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.276

A friend of his, a Mr Warrington, has spoken against us several times
with extraordinary ability, as Barnes owns.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.277

Do you know Mr W.?  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.278

He wrote a dreadful article in the <font> Independent <$$font> about
the last poor lecture, which was indeed sad sentimental commonplace:
THACKERAY-1855-2,709.279

and the critique is terribly comical.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.280

I could not help laughing, remembering some passages in it, when Barnes
mentioned it: THACKERAY-1855-2,709.281

and my brother became so angry!  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.282

They have put up a dreadful caricature of B. in Newcome:
THACKERAY-1855-2,709.283

and my brother says he did it, THACKERAY-1855-2,709.284

but I hope not.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.285

It is very droll, though: THACKERAY-1855-2,709.286

he used to make them very funnily.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.287

I am glad he has spirits for it.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.288

Goodbye, again.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.289

- E. N. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,709.290

'He says he did it! 'cries Mr Pendennis, laying the letter down.
THACKERAY-1855-2,709.291

'Barnes Newcome would scarcely caricature himself, my dear! '
THACKERAY-1855-2,709.292

'"He"often means - means Clive - I think,'says Mrs Pendennis, in an off
hand manner.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.293

'Oh!  he means Clive, does he, Laura? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,709.294

'Yes - and you mean goose, Mr Pendennis! 'that saucy lady replies.
THACKERAY-1855-2,709.295

It must have been about the very time that this letter was written,
that a critical conversation occurred between Clive and his father, of
which the lad did not inform me until much later days; as was the case -
the reader has been more than once begged to believe - with many other
portions of this biography.  THACKERAY-1855-2,709.296

One night the Colonel, having come home from a round of electioneering
visits, not half satisfied with himself, exceedingly annoyed <paren>
much more than he cared to own <$$paren> with the impudence of some rude
fellows at the public-houses, who had interrupted his fine speeches
with odious hiccups and familiar jeers, was seated brooding over
his cheroot by his chimney fire; friend F. B. <paren>
of whose companionship his patron was occasionally tired <$$paren>
finding much better amusement with <P_710> the'Jolly Britons'in the
Boscawen Room below.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.297

The Colonel, as an electioneering business, had made his appearance in
the club.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.298

But that ancient Roman warrior had frightened those simple Britons.
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.299

His manners were too awful for them; THACKERAY-1855-2,710.300

so were Clive's, who visited them also under Mr Potts's introduction;
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.301

but the two gentlemen - each being full of care and personal annoyance at
the time - acted like wet blankets upon the Britons, whereas F.
B. warmed them and cheered them, affably partook of their meals
with them, and graciously shared their cups.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.302

So the Colonel was alone, listening to the far-off roar of the Britons'
choruses by an expiring fire, as he sat by a glass of cold negus and
the ashes of his cigar.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.303

I dare say he may have been thinking that his fire was well nigh
out, his cup at the dregs, his pipe little more now than dust and
ashes - when Clive, candle in hand, came into their sitting-room.
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.304

As each saw the other's face, it was so very sad and worn and pale, that
the young man started back; and the elder, with quite the tenderness of
old days, cried,'God bless me, my boy, THACKERAY-1855-2,710.305

how ill you look!  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.306

Come THACKERAY-1855-2,710.307

and warm yourself - THACKERAY-1855-2,710.308

look, the $fire $'s {TEXT:fire's} out.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.309

Have something, Clivy! 'THACKERAY-1855-2,710.310

For months past they had not had a really kind word.
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.311

The tender old voice smote upon Clive, THACKERAY-1855-2,710.312

and he burst into sudden tears.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.313

They rained upon his father's trembling old brown hand as he stooped
down and kissed it.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.314

'You look very ill too, father,'says Clive.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.315

'Ill?  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.316

not I! 'cries the father, still keeping the boy's hand under both his
own on the mantelpiece.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.317

'Such a battered old fellow as I am has a right to look the worse for
wear; THACKERAY-1855-2,710.318

but you, boy, why do <font> you <$$font> look so pale? '
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.319

'I have seen a ghost, father,'Clive answered.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.320

Thomas, however, looked alarmed and inquisitive, as though the boy was
wandering in his mind.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.321

'The ghost of my youth, father, the ghost of my happiness, and the best
days of my life,'groaned out the young man.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.322

'I saw Ethel to-day.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.323

I went to see Sarah Mason, THACKERAY-1855-2,710.324

and she was there. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,710.325

'I had seen her, THACKERAY-1855-2,710.326

but I did not speak of her,'said the father.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.327

'I thought it was best not to mention her to you, my poor boy.
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.328

And are - are you fond of her still, Clive? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,710.329

'Still!  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.330

once means always in these things, father, $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} it?
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.331

Once means to-day, and yesterday, and for ever and ever. '
THACKERAY-1855-2,710.332

'Nay, my boy, you $must $n't {TEXT:mustn't} talk to me so, or even to
yourself so.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.333

You have the dearest little wife at home, a dear little wife and child.
'THACKERAY-1855-2,710.334

'You had a son, THACKERAY-1855-2,710.335

and have been kind enough to him, God knows.  THACKERAY-1855-2,710.336

<P_711>

<font> You <$$font> had a wife: THACKERAY-1855-2,711.338

but that $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} prevent other - other thoughts.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.339

Do you know you never spoke twice in your life about my mother?
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.340

You $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} care for her. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.341

'I - I did my duty by her: THACKERAY-1855-2,711.342

I denied her nothing.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.343

I scarcely ever had a word with her, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.344

and I did my best to make her happy,'interposed the Colonel.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.345

'I know, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.346

but your heart was with the other.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.347

So is mine.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.348

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} fatal; THACKERAY-1855-2,711.349

it runs in the family, father. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.350

The boy looked so ineffably wretched that the father's heart melted
still more.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.351

'I did my best, Clive,'the Colonel gasped out.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.352

'I went to that villain Barnes THACKERAY-1855-2,711.353

and offered him to settle every shilling I was worth on you -
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.354

I did - THACKERAY-1855-2,711.355

you $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} know that - THACKERAY-1855-2,711.356

$I $'d {TEXT:I'd} kill myself for your sake, Clivy.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.357

$What $'s {TEXT:What's} an old fellow worth living for?
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.358

I can live upon a crust and a cigar.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.359

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care about a carriage, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.360

and only go in it to please Rosey.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.361

I wanted to give up all for you, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.362

but he played me false, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.363

that scoundrel cheated us both; THACKERAY-1855-2,711.364

he did, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.365

and so did Ethel. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.366

'No, sir; I may have thought so in my rage once, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.367

but I know better now.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.368

She was the victim and not the agent.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.369

Did Madame de Florae play <font> you <$$font> false when she married
her husband?  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.370

It was her fate, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.371

and she underwent it.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.372

We all bow to it, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.373

we are in the track THACKERAY-1855-2,711.374

and the car passes over us.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.375

You know it does, father. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.376

The Colonel was a fatalist; THACKERAY-1855-2,711.377

he had often advanced this oriental creed in his simple discourses with
his son and Clive's friends.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.378

'Besides,'Clive went on,'Ethel does not care for me.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.379

She received me to-day quite coldly, THACKERAY-1855-2,711.380

and held her hand out as if we had only parted last year.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.381

I suppose she likes that Marquis who jilted her - THACKERAY-1855-2,711.382

God bless her.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.383

How shall we know what wins the hearts of women?  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.384

She has mine.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.385

There was my Fate.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.386

Praise be to Allah!  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.387

It is over. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.388

'But $there $'s {TEXT:there's} that villain who injured you.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.389

His isn't over yet,'cried the Colonel, clenching his trembling hand.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.390

'Ah, father!  Let us leave him to Allah too!  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.391

Suppose Madame de Florae had a brother who insulted you.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.392

You know you $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} have revenged yourself.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.393

You would have wounded her in striking him. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.394

'You called out Barnes yourself, boy,'cried the father.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.395

'That was for another cause, and not for my quarrel.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.396

And how do you know I intended to fire?  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.397

By Jove, I was so miserable then that an ounce of lead would have done
me little harm! 'THACKERAY-1855-2,711.398

The father saw the son's mind more clearly than he had ever done hitherto.
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.399

They had scarcely ever talked upon that subject, which the Colonel found
was so deeply fixed in Clive's heart.  THACKERAY-1855-2,711.400

He thought of his own early days, and how he had suffered,
THACKERAY-1855-2,711.401

and beheld his son before <P_712> him racked with the same cruel pangs
of enduring grief.  THACKERAY-1855-2,712.402

And he began to own that he had pressed him too hastily in his marriage;
and to make an allowance for an unhappiness of which he had in part been
the cause.  THACKERAY-1855-2,712.403

'Mashallah!  Clive, my boy,'said the old man, THACKERAY-1855-2,712.404

'what is done is done. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,712.405

'Let us break up our camp before this place, and not go to war with
Barnes, father,'said Clive.  THACKERAY-1855-2,712.406

'Let us have peace - and forgive him if we can. ''And retreat before
this scoundrel, Clive? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,712.407

'What is a victory over such a fellow?  THACKERAY-1855-2,712.408

One gives a chimney-sweep the wall, father. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,712.409

'I say again - What is done is done.  THACKERAY-1855-2,712.410

I have promised to meet him at the hustings, THACKERAY-1855-2,712.411

and I will.  THACKERAY-1855-2,712.412

I think it is best: and you are right: and you act like a high-minded
gentleman - and my dear dear old boy - not to meddle in the quarrel
- though I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} think so - and the difference
gave me a great deal of pain - and so did what Pendennis said -
and $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} wrong - and thank God I am wrong - and God
bless you, my own boy! 'the Colonel cried out in a burst of emotion.
THACKERAY-1855-2,712.413

And the two went to their bedrooms together, THACKERAY-1855-2,712.414

and were happier as they shook hands at the doors of their
adjoining chambers than they had been for many a long day and year.
THACKERAY-1855-2,712.415

Chapter LXIX THACKERAY-1855-2,713.418

<font> The Election <$$font> THACKERAY-1855-2,713.419

<$$heading>

Having thus given his challenge, reconnoitred the enemy, and pledged
himself to do battle at the ensuing election, our Colonel took leave of
the town of Newcome, THACKERAY-1855-2,713.421

and returned to his banking affairs in London.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.422

His departure was as that of a great public personage;
THACKERAY-1855-2,713.423

the gentlemen of the Committee followed him obsequiously down to the
train.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.424

'Quick,'bawls out Mr Potts to Mr Brown, the station-master,
THACKERAY-1855-2,713.425

'quick, Mr Brown, a carriage for Colonel Newcome! '
THACKERAY-1855-2,713.426

$Half $a $dozen {TEXT:Half-a-dozen} hats are taken off as he enters into
the carriage, F. Bayham and his servant after him, with portfolios,
umbrellas, shawls, despatch-boxes.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.427

Clive was not there to act as his father's aide-de-camp.
THACKERAY-1855-2,713.428

After their conversation together the young man had returned to Mrs
Clive and his other duties in life.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.429

It has been said that Mr Pendennis was in the country, engaged in
a pursuit exactly similar to that which occupied Colonel Newcome.
THACKERAY-1855-2,713.430

The menaced dissolution of Parliament did not take place so soon as
we expected.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.431

The Ministry still hung together, THACKERAY-1855-2,713.432

and by consequence, Sir Barnes Newcome kept his seat in the House
of Commons, from which his elder kinsman was eager to oust him.
THACKERAY-1855-2,713.433

Away from London, and having but few correspondents, save on affairs of
business, I heard little of Clive and the Colonel, save an occasional
puff of one of Colonel Newcome's entertainments in the <font> Pall Mall
Gazette <$$font>, to which journal F. Bayham still condescended
to contribute; and a satisfactory announcement in a certain part of that
paper, that on such a day, in Hyde Park Gardens, Mrs Clive Newcome had
presented her husband with a son.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.434

Clive wrote to me presently to inform me of the circumstance, stating
at the same time, with but moderate gratification on his own part, that
the Campaigner, Mrs Newcome's mamma, had upon this second occasion made
a second lodgment in her daughter's house and bedchamber, and showed
herself affably disposed to forget the little unpleasantries which had
clouded over the sunshine of her former visit.  THACKERAY-1855-2,713.435

Laura, with a smile of some humour, said she thought now would be the time
when, if Clive could be spared from his bank, he might pay <P_714> us that
visit at Fairoaks which had been due so long, THACKERAY-1855-2,714.436

and hinted that change of air and a temporary absence from Mrs Mackenzie
might be agreeable to my old friend.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.437

It was, on the contrary, Mr Pendennis's opinion that his wife artfully
chose that period of time when little Rosey was, perforce, kept at home
and occupied with her delightful maternal duties, to invite Clive to
see us.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.438

Mrs Laura frankly owned that she liked our Clive better without his wife
than with her, THACKERAY-1855-2,714.439

and never ceased to regret that pretty Rosey had not bestowed her little
hand upon Captain Hoby, as she had been very well disposed at one time
to do.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.440

Against all marriages of interest this sentimental Laura never failed
to utter indignant protests; THACKERAY-1855-2,714.441

and Clive's had been a marriage of interest, a marriage made up by the
old people, a marriage to which the young man had only yielded out of
good-nature and obedience.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.442

She would apostrophise her unconscious young ones, and inform those
innocent babies that <font> they <$$font> should never be made to marry
except for love, never - an announcement which was received with perfect
indifference by little Arthur on his rocking-horse, and little Helen
smiling and crowing in her mother's lap.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.443

So Clive came down to us careworn in appearance, but very pleased and
happy, he said, to stay for a while with the friends of his youth.
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.444

We showed him our modest rural lions; THACKERAY-1855-2,714.445

we got him such sport and company as our quiet neighbourhood afforded,
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.446

we gave him fishing in the Brawl, THACKERAY-1855-2,714.447

and Laura in her pony-chaise drove him to Baymouth, and to Clavering
Park and town, and to visit the famous cathedral at Chatteris, where
she was pleased to recount certain incidents of her husband's youth.
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.448

Clive laughed at my wife's stories; THACKERAY-1855-2,714.449

he pleased himself in our home; THACKERAY-1855-2,714.450

he played with our children, with whom he became a great favourite;
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.451

he was happier, he told me with a sigh, than he had been for many a day.
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.452

His gentle hostess echoed the sigh of the poor young fellow.
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.453

She was sure that his pleasure was only transitory, and was convinced
that many deep cares weighed upon his mind.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.454

Ere long my old schoolfellow made me sundry confessions, which showed
that Laura's surmises were correct.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.455

About his domestic affairs he did not treat much; THACKERAY-1855-2,714.456

the little boy was said to be a very fine little boy;
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.457

the ladies had taken entire possession of him.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.458

'I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} stand Mrs Mackenzie any longer, I own, 'says
Clive; THACKERAY-1855-2,714.459

'but how resist a wife at such a moment?  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.460

Rosa was sure she would die unless her mother came to her,
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.461

and of course we invited Mrs Mack.  THACKERAY-1855-2,714.462

This time she is all smiles and politeness with the Colonel:
THACKERAY-1855-2,714.463

the last quarrel is laid upon me, THACKERAY-1855-2,714.464

and <P_715> in so far I am easy, as the old folks get on pretty well
together. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.465

To me, considering these things, it was clear that Mr Clive Newcome was
but a very secondary personage indeed in his father's new fine house
which he inhabited, and in which the poor Colonel had hoped they were
to live such a happy family.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.466

But it was about Clive Newcome's pecuniary affairs that I felt the most
disquiet when he came to explain these to me.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.467

The Colonel's capital and that considerable sum which Mrs Clive had
inherited from her good old uncle, were all involved in a common stock,
of which Colonel Newcome took the management.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.468

'The governor understands business so well, you see,'says Clive;
THACKERAY-1855-2,715.469

'is a most remarkable head for accounts; THACKERAY-1855-2,715.470

he must have inherited that from my grandfather, you know, who made his
own fortune: THACKERAY-1855-2,715.471

all the Newcomes are good at accounts except me, a poor useless devil
who knows nothing but to paint a picture, and who $can $n't {TEXT:can't}
even do that. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.472

He cuts off the head of a thistle as he speaks, THACKERAY-1855-2,715.473

bites his tawny mustachios, THACKERAY-1855-2,715.474

plunges his hands into his pockets and his soul into reverie.
THACKERAY-1855-2,715.475

'You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mean to say,'asks Mr Pendennis,
'that your wife's fortune has not been settled upon herself? '
THACKERAY-1855-2,715.476

'Of course it has been settled upon herself; THACKERAY-1855-2,715.477

that is, it is entirely her own - THACKERAY-1855-2,715.478

you know the Colonel has managed all the business,
THACKERAY-1855-2,715.479

he understands it better than we do. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.480

'Do you say that your wife's money is not vested in the hands of trustees
, and for her benefit? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.481

'My father is one of the trustees.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.482

I tell you he manages the whole thing.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.483

What is his property is mine THACKERAY-1855-2,715.484

and ever has been: THACKERAY-1855-2,715.485

and I might draw upon him as much as I liked: THACKERAY-1855-2,715.486

and you know $it $'s {TEXT:it's} five times as great as my wife's.
THACKERAY-1855-2,715.487

What is his is ours, THACKERAY-1855-2,715.488

and what is ours is his, of course: THACKERAY-1855-2,715.489

for instance, the India Stock, which poor Uncle James left, that now
stands in the Colonel's name.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.490

He wants to be a Director: THACKERAY-1855-2,715.491

he will be at the next election - THACKERAY-1855-2,715.492

he must have a certain quantity of India Stock, $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
you see? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.493

'My dear fellow, is there then no settlement made upon your wife at
all? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.494

'You $need $n't {TEXT:needn't} look so frightened,'says Clive.
THACKERAY-1855-2,715.495

'I made a settlement on her: THACKERAY-1855-2,715.496

with all my worldly goods I did her endow - three thousand three hundred
and thirty-three pounds six and eightpence, which my father sent over from
India to my uncle, years ago, when I came home.  'THACKERAY-1855-2,715.497

I might well indeed be aghast at this news, THACKERAY-1855-2,715.498

and had yet further intelligence from Clive, which by no means contributed
to lessen my anxiety.  THACKERAY-1855-2,715.499

This worthy old Colonel, who fancied himself to be so clever <P_716>
a man of business, chose to conduct it in utter ignorance and defiance
of law.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.500

If anything happened to the Bundelcund Bank, it was clear that not only
every shilling of his own property, but every farthing bequeathed to Rosey
Mackenzie would be lost; only his retiring pension, which was luckily
considerable, and the hundred pounds a year which Clive had settled on
his wife, would be saved out of the ruin.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.501

And now Clive confided to me his own serious doubts and misgivings
regarding the prosperity of the Bank itself.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.502

He did not know why, THACKERAY-1855-2,716.503

but he could not help fancying that things were going wrong.
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.504

Those partners who had come home, having sold out of the Bank,
and were living in England so splendidly, why had they quitted it?
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.505

The Colonel said it was a proof of the prosperity of the company,
that so many gentlemen were enriched who had taken shares in it.
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.506

'But when I asked my father,'Clive continued,'why he did not himself
withdraw, the dear old boy's countenance fell: THACKERAY-1855-2,716.507

he told me such things were not to be done every day;
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.508

and ended, as usual, by saying that I do not understand anything about
business.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.509

No more I do: THACKERAY-1855-2,716.510

that is the truth.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.511

I hate the whole concern, Pen!  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.512

I hate that great tawdry house in which we live; and those fearfully
stupid parties!  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.513

Oh, how I wish we were back in Fitzroy Square!  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.514

But who can recall bygones, Arthur; or wrong steps in life?
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.515

We must make the best of to-day, THACKERAY-1855-2,716.516

and to-morrow must take care of itself.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.517

"Poor little child! "I could not help thinking, as I took it crying in
my arms the other day, THACKERAY-1855-2,716.518

"what has life in store for you, my poor weeping baby? "
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.519

My mother-in-law cried out that I should drop the baby, and that only
the Colonel knew how to hold it.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.520

My wife called from her bed; THACKERAY-1855-2,716.521

the nurse dashed up THACKERAY-1855-2,716.522

and scolded me; THACKERAY-1855-2,716.523

and they drove me out of the room amongst them.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.524

By Jove, Pen, I laugh when some of my friends congratulate me on my
good fortune!  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.525

I am not quite the father of my own child, nor the husband of my own wife,
nor even the master of my own easel.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.526

I am managed for, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you see!  boarded, lodged,
and done for.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.527

And here is the man they call happy.  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.528

Happy!  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.529

Oh! ! !  why had I not your strength of mind?  THACKERAY-1855-2,716.530

and why did I ever leave my art, my mistress? ' THACKERAY-1855-2,716.531

And herewith the poor lad fell to chopping thistles again;
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.532

and quitted Fairoaks shortly, leaving his friends there
very much disquieted about his prospects, actual and future.
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.533

The expected dissolution of Parliament came at length.
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.534

All the country papers in England teemed with electioneering addresses;
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.535

and the country was in a flutter with parti-coloured ribands.
THACKERAY-1855-2,716.536

Colonel Thomas Newcome, pursuant to his promise, offered himself to the
independent electors of Newcome in the Liberal journal of the family
<P_717> town, whilst Sir Barnes Newcome, Bart., addressed
himself to his old and tried friends, and called upon the friends
of the constitution to rally round him, in the Conservative print.
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.537

The addresses of our friend were sent to us at Fairoaks by the Colonel's
indefatigable aide-de-camp, Mr Frederick Bayham.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.538

During the period which had elapsed since the Colonel's last canvassing
visit and the issuing of the writs now daily expected for the new
Parliament, many things of great importance had occurred in Thomas
Newcome's family - events which were kept secret from his biographer, who
was, at this period also, pretty entirely occupied with his own affairs.
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.539

These, however, are not the present subject of this history, which
has Newcome for its business, and the parties engaged in the family
quarrel there.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.540

There were four candidates in the field for the representation of that
borough.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.541

That old and tried Member of Parliament, Mr Bunce, was considered to be
secure; THACKERAY-1855-2,717.542

and the Baronet's seat was thought to be pretty safe on account of his
influence in the place.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.543

Nevertheless, Thomas Newcome's supporters were confident for their
champion, and that when the parties came to the poll, the extreme
Liberals of the borough would divide their votes between him
and the fourth candidate, the uncompromising Radical, Mr Barker.
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.544

In due time the Colonel and his staff arrived at Newcome,
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.545

and resumed the active canvass which they had commenced some months
previously.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.546

Clive was not in his father's suite this time, nor Mr Warrington, whose
engagements took him elsewhere.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.547

The lawyer, the editor of the <font> Independent <$$font>, and F.
B. were the Colonel's chief men.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.548

His headquarters <paren> which F. B. liked very well
<$$paren> were at the hotel where we last saw him, and whence issuing
with his aide-de-camp at his heels, the Colonel went round to canvass
personally, according to his promise, every free and independent elector
of the borough.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.549

Barnes too was canvassing eagerly on his side, THACKERAY-1855-2,717.550

and was most affable and active; THACKERAY-1855-2,717.551

the two parties would often meet nose to nose in the same street, and
their retainers exchange looks of defiance.  THACKERAY-1855-2,717.552

With Mr Potts of the <font> Independent <$$font>, a big man, on his left;
with Mr Frederick, a still bigger man, on his right; his own trusty
bamboo cane in his hand, before which poor Barnes had shrunk abashed ere
now, Colonel Newcome had commonly the best of these street encounters,
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.553

and frowned his nephew Barnes, and Barnes's staff, off the pavement.
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.554

With the non-electors the Colonel was a decided favourite;
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.555

the boys invariably hurrahed him; whereas they jeered and uttered
ironical cries after poor Barnes, asking,'Who beat his wife?  Who drove
his children to the workhouse? 'and other unkind personal questions.
THACKERAY-1855-2,717.556

The man upon whom the <P_718> libertine Barnes had inflicted so cruel
an injury in his early days, was now the Baronet's bitterest enemy.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.557

He assailed him with curses and threats when they met,
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.558

and leagued his brother workmen against him.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.559

The wretched Sir Barnes owned with contrition that the sins of his youth
pursued him; THACKERAY-1855-2,718.560

his enemy scoffed at the idea of Barnes's repentance;
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.561

he was not moved at the grief, the punishment in his own family, the
humiliation and remorse which the repentant prodigal piteously pleaded.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.562

No man was louder in his cries of <font> mea culpa <$$font> than Barnes
; THACKERAY-1855-2,718.563

no man professed a more edifying repentance.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.564

He was hat in hand to every black coat, established or dissenting.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.565

Repentance was to his interest, to be sure, THACKERAY-1855-2,718.566

but yet let us hope it was sincere.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.567

There is some hypocrisy of which one does not like even to entertain the
thought; especially that awful falsehood which trades with divine truth,
and takes the name of Heaven in vain.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.568

The'Roebuck Inn,'at Newcome, stands in the market-place, directly facing
the'King's Arms,'where, as we know, Colonel Newcome and uncompromising
toleration held their headquarters.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.569

Immense banners of blue and yellow floated from every window of the'
King's Arms,'THACKERAY-1855-2,718.570

and decorated the balcony from which the Colonel and his assistants were
in the habit of addressing the multitude.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.571

Fiddlers and trumpeters, arrayed in his colours, paraded the town
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.572

and enlivened it with their melodious strains.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.573

Other trumpeters and fiddlers, bearing the true-blue cockades and colours
of Sir Barnes Newcome, Bart., would encounter the Colonel's
musicians, on which occasions of meeting, it is to be feared, small
harmony was produced.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.574

They banged each other with their brazen instruments.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.575

The warlike drummers thumped each other's heads in lieu of the
professional sheepskin.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.576

The town boys and street blackguards rejoiced in these combats,
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.577

and exhibited their valour on one side or the other.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.578

The Colonel had to pay a long bill for broken brass, when he settled
the little accounts of the election.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.579

In after times F. B. was pleased to describe the
circumstances of a contest in which he bore a most distinguished part.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.580

It was F. B.'s opinion that his private eloquence brought over many
waverers to the Colonel's side, and converted numbers of the benighted
followers of Sir Barnes Newcome.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.581

Bayham's voice was indeed magnificent, THACKERAY-1855-2,718.582

and could be heard from the'King's Arms'balcony above the shout and
roar of the multitude, the gongs and bugles of the opposition bands.
THACKERAY-1855-2,718.583

He was untiring in his oratory - undaunted in the presence of the
crowds below.  THACKERAY-1855-2,718.584

He was immensely popular, F. B. THACKERAY-1855-2,718.585

Whether he laid his hand upon his broad chest, took off his hat and
waved it, or pressed his blue and yellow ribands to his bosom, the
crowd shouted,'Hurrah!  <P_719> silence!  bravo!  Bayham for ever!
'THACKERAY-1855-2,719.586

'They would have carried me in triumph,'said F. B.;
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.587

'if I had but the necessary qualification, I might be Member for Newcome
this day or any other I chose. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,719.588

I am afraid, in his conduct of the Colonel's election, Mr Bayham
resorted to acts of which his principal certainly would disapprove
, and engaged auxiliaries whose alliance was scarcely creditable.
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.589

Whose was the hand which flung the potato which struck Sir Barnes Newcome
, Bart., on the nose as he was haranguing the people from the
'Roebuck'?  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.590

How came it that whenever Sir Barnes and his friends essayed to speak,
such an awful yelling and groaning took place in the crowd below, that the
words of those feeble orators were inaudible?  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.591

Who smashed all the front windows of the'Roebuck'?
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.592

Colonel Newcome had not words to express his indignation at proceedings
so unfair.  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.593

When Sir Barnes and his staff were hustled in the market-place and most
outrageously shoved, jeered, and jolted, the Colonel from the 'King's
Arms'organised a rapid sally, which he himself headed with his bamboo
cane; THACKERAY-1855-2,719.594

cut out Sir Barnes and his followers from the hands of the mob,
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.595

and addressed those ruffians in a noble speech, of which the bamboo cane
- Englishman - shame - fair-play, were the most emphatic expressions.
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.596

The mob cheered Old Tom as they called him - THACKERAY-1855-2,719.597

they made way for Sir Barnes, who shrank pale and shuddering back
into his hotel again - and who always persisted in saying that that
old villain of a dragoon had planned both the assault and the rescue.
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.598

'When the dregs of the people - the scum of the rabble, sir, banded
together by the myrmidons of Sir Barnes Newcome, attacked us at the
"King's Arms,"and smashed ninety-six pounds'worth of glass at one volley,
besides knocking off the gold unicorn's head and the tail of the British
lion; it was fine, sir,'F. B. said, 'to see how the Colonel
came forward, and the coolness of the old boy in the midst of the action.
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.599

He stood there in front, sir, with his old hat off, never so much as
once bobbing his old head, THACKERAY-1855-2,719.600

and I think he spoke rather better under fire than he did when there
was no danger.  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.601

Between ourselves, he $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} much of a speaker, the old
Colonel; THACKERAY-1855-2,719.602

he hems and hahs, THACKERAY-1855-2,719.603

and repeats himself a good deal.  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.604

He $has $n't {TEXT:hasn't} the gift of natural eloquence which some men
have, Pendennis.  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.605

You should have heard my speech, sir, on the Thursday in the Town Hall -
THACKERAY-1855-2,719.606

that was something like a speech.  THACKERAY-1855-2,719.607

Potts was jealous of it, THACKERAY-1855-2,719.608

and always reported me most shamefully. 'THACKERAY-1855-2,719.609

In spite of his respectful behaviour to the gentlemen in black coats, his
soup tickets and his flannel tickets, his own pathetic lectures and his
sedulous attendance at other folks'sermons, poor Barnes could not keep up
his credit with the serious interest at Newcome, THACKERAY-1855-2,719.610

and the <P_720> meeting-houses and their respective pastors and
frequenters turned their backs upon him.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.611

The case against him was too flagrant: THACKERAY-1855-2,720.612

his enemy, the factory man, worked it with an extraordinary skill,
malice, and pertinacity.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.613

Not a single man, woman, or child in Newcome but was made acquainted
with Sir Barnes's early peccadillo.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.614

Ribald ballads were howled through the streets describing his sin,
and his deserved punishment.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.615

For very shame, the reverend dissenting gentlemen were obliged to refrain
from voting for him; THACKERAY-1855-2,720.616

such as ventured, believing in the sincerity of his repentance,
to give him their voices, were yelled away from the polling places.
THACKERAY-1855-2,720.617

A very great number who would have been his friends were compelled to
bow to decency and public opinion, THACKERAY-1855-2,720.618

and supported the Colonel.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.619

Hooted away from the hustings and the public places whence the rival
candidates addressed the free and independent electors, this wretched
and persecuted Sir Barnes invited his friends and supporters to meet
him at the'Athenaeum Room'- scene of his previous eloquent performances.
THACKERAY-1855-2,720.620

But though this apartment was defended by tickets, the people burst into
it; THACKERAY-1855-2,720.621

and Nemesis, in the shape of the persevering factory man, appeared before
the scared Sir Barnes and his puzzled committee.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.622

The man stood up THACKERAY-1855-2,720.623

and bearded the pale baronet.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.624

He had a good cause, THACKERAY-1855-2,720.625

and was in truth a far better master of debate than our banking friend,
being a great speaker amongst his brother operatives, by whom political
questions are discussed, and the conduct of political men examined, with
a ceaseless interest and with an ardour and eloquence which are often
unknown in what is called superior society.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.626

This man and his friends round about him fiercely silenced the clamour
of 'Turn him out! 'with which his first appearance was assailed by Sir
Barnes's hangers-on.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.627

He said, in the name of justice he would speak up; if they were fathers
of families, and loved their wives and daughters, he dared them to refuse
him a hearing.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.628

Did they love their wives and their children?  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.629

it was a shame that they should take such a man as that yonder for their
representative in Parliament.  THACKERAY-1855-2,720.630

But the greatest sensation he made was when, in the middle of his speech
, after inveighing against Barnes's cruelty and parental ingratitude,
he asked,'Where were Barnes's children? 'THACKERAY-1855-2,720.631

and actually thrust forward two, to the amazement of the committee
and the ghastly astonishment of the guilty baronet himself.
THACKERAY-1855-2,720.632
