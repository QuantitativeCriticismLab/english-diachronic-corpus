Chap. VII.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.3

{COM:chapter_26}

A reformation in the goal {COM:sic}.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.5

To make laws complete, they should reward as well as punish.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.6

<$$heading>

The next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in
tears at my bed-side.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.8

The gloomy strength of every thing about us, it seems, had daunted them.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.9

I gently rebuked their sorrow, assuring them I had never slept with
greater tranquillity, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.10

and next enquired after my eldest daughter, who was not among them.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.11

They informed me that yesterday's uneasiness and fatigue had encreased
her fever, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.12

and it was judged proper to leave her behind.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.13

My next care was to send my son to procure a room or two to lodge
the family in, as near the prison as conveniently could be found.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.14

He obeyed; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,84.15

but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a small expence,
<P_2,85> for his mother and sisters, the goaler {COM:sic} with humanity
consenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the prison
with me.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.16

A bed was therefore prepared for them in a corner of the room, which I
thought answered very conveniently.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.17

I was willing however previously to know whether my little children
chose to lie in a place which seemed to fright them upon entrance.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.18

"Well,"cried I,"my good boys, how do you like your bed?
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.19

I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears.
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.20

"No, papa,"says Dick,"I am not afraid to lie any where where you
are. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.21

"And I,"says Bill, who was yet but four years old,"love every place best
that my papa is in. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.22

After this, I allotted to each of the family what they were to do.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.23

My daughter was particularly directed to watch her declining sister's
health; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,85.24

my wife was to attend <P_2,86> me; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.25

my little boys were to read to me: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.26

"And as for you, my son,"continued I,"it is by the labour of your hands
we must all hope to be supported.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.27

Your wages, as a day-labourer, will be full sufficient, with
proper frugality, to maintain us all, and comfortably too.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.28

Thou art now sixteen years old, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.29

and hast strength, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.30

and it was given thee, my son, for very useful purposes;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.31

for it must save from famine your helpless parents and family.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.32

Prepare then this evening to look out for work against to-morrow,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.33

and bring home every night what money you earn, for our support.
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.34

Having thus instructed him, and settled the rest, I walked down
to the common prison, where I could enjoy more air and room.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.35

But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdness, and brutality
that invaded me on every side, drove me back to my apartment again.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,86.36

Here I sate for some time, pondering upon the strange infatuation
of wretches, who finding all mankind in open arms against them, were,
however, <P_2,87> labouring to make themselves a future and a tremendous
enemy.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.37

Their insensibility excited my highest compassion,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.38

and blotted my own uneasiness from my mind.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.39

It even appeared a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.40

I resolved therefore once more to return, and in spite of their
contempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by perseverance.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.41

Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jenkinson of my
design, at which he laughed heartily, but communicated it to the rest.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.42

The proposal was received with the greatest good-humour, as it promised
to afford a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other
resource for mirth, but what could be derived from ridicule or debauchery.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.43

I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud unaffected
voice, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.44

and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occasion.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.45

Lewd whispers, groans of contrition burlesqued, winking and coughing,
alternately excited laughter.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,87.46

However.  {COM:sic} <P_2,88> I continued with my natural solemnity to
read on, sensible that what I did might amend some, but could itself
receive no contamination from any.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.47

After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather calculated
at first to amuse them than to reprove.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.48

I previously observed, that no other motive but their welfare could
induce me to this; that I was their fellow prisoner, and now gained
nothing by preaching.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.49

I was sorry I said, to hear them so very prophane; because they got
nothing by it, but might lose a great deal: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.50

"For be assured, my friends,"cried I,"for you are my friends, however
the world may disclaim your friendship, though you swore twelve
thousand oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your purse.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.51

Then what signifies calling every moment upon the devil, and
courting his friendship, since you find how scurvily he uses you.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.52

He has given you nothing here, you find, but a mouthful of oaths and an
empty belly; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,88.53

and by the best accounts I have of him, <P_2,89> he will give you nothing
$that $'s {TEXT:that's} good hereafter. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.54

If used ill in our dealings with one man, we naturally go elsewhere.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.55

Were it not worth your while then, just to try how you may like the usage
of another master, who gives you fair promises at least to come to him.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.56

Surely, my Friends, of all stupidity in the world, his must be greatest
, who, after robbing an house, runs to the thief-takers for protection.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.57

And yet how are you more wise?  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.58

You are all seeking comfort from one that has already betrayed you,
applying to a more malicious being than any thief-taker of them all;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.59

for they only decoy, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.60

and then hang you; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.61

but he decoys and hangs, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.62

and what is worst of all, will not let you loose after the hangman has
done. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.63

When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience,
some of whom came and shook me by the hand, swearing that I was a
very honest fellow, and that they desired my further acquaintance.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,89.64

<P_2,90>

I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.66

and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.67

for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of
amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer
could but take a proper aim.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.68

When I had thus satisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where
my wife had prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkinson begged
leave to add his dinner to ours, and partake of the pleasure, as he was
kind enough to express it, of my conversation.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.69

He had not yet seen my family, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.70

for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow passage,
already described, by this means they avoided the common prison.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.71

Jenkinson at the first interview therefore seemed not a little struck
with the beauty of my youngest daughter, which her pensive air contributed
to heighten, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.72

and my little ones did not pass unnoticed.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.73

"Alas, Doctor,"cried he,"these children are too handsome and too good
for such a place as this! "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,90.74

<P_2,91>

"Why, Mr. Jenkinson", replied I,"thank heaven my children are
pretty tolerable in morals, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.76

and if they be good, it matters little for the rest. "
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.77

"I fancy, sir,"returned my fellow prisoner,"that it must give you great
comfort to have this little family about you. " GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.78

"A comfort, Mr. Jenkinson,"replied I,"yes it is indeed a comfort,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.79

and I would not be without them for all the world;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.80

for they can make a dungeon seem a palace.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.81

There is but one way in this life of wounding my happiness,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.82

and that is by injuring them. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.83

"I am afraid then, sir,"cried he,"that I am in some measure culpable;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.84

for I think I see here <paren> looking at my son Moses <$$paren>
one that I have injured, and by whom I wish to be forgiven. "
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.85

My son immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had
before seen him in disguise, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.86

and taking him by the hand, with a smile forgave him.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,91.87

"Yet,"<P_2,92> continued he,"I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help wondering
at what you could see in my face, to think me a proper mark for
deception. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.88

"My dear sir,"returned the other,"it was not your face, but your
white stockings and the black ribbond in your hair, that allured me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.89

But no disparagement to your parts, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.90

I have deceived wiser men than you in my time; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.91

and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many for me
at last. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.92

"I suppose,"cried my son,"that the narrative of such a life as yours
must be extremely instructive and amusing. " GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.93

"Not much of either,"returned Mr Jenkinson.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.94

"Those relations which describe the tricks and vices only of
mankind, by increasing our suspicion in life, retard our success.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.95

The traveller that distrusts every person he meets, and turns back upon
the appearance of every man that looks like a robber, seldom arrives in
time at his journey's end.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,92.96

<P_2,93>

"Indeed I think from my own experience I may say, that the knowing one
is the silliest fellow under the sun.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.98

I was thought cunning from my very childhood: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.99

when but seven years old the ladies would say that I was a perfect little
man; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.100

at fourteen I knew the world, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.101

cocked my hat, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.102

and loved the ladies; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.103

at twenty, though I was perfectly honest, yet every one thought me so
cunning, that not one would trust me.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.104

Thus I was at last obliged to turn sharper in my own defence,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.105

and have lived ever since, my head throbbing with schemes to deceive, and
my heart palpitating with fears of detection.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.106

"I used often to laugh at your honest simple neighbour Flamborough,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.107

and one way or another generally cheated him once a year.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.108

Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.109

and grew rich, while I still continued tricksy and cunning, and was poor ,
without the consolation of being honest.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,93.110

<P_2,94>

"However,"continued he,"let me know your case, and what has brought you
here; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,94.112

perhaps though I have not skill to avoid a gaol myself, I may extricate
my friends. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,94.113

In compliance with his curiosity, I informed him of the whole train
of accidents and follies that had plunged me into my present troubles,
and my utter inability to get free.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,94.114

After hearing my story, and pausing some minutes, he slapt his forehead ,
as if he had hit upon something material, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,94.115

and took his leave, saying he would try what could be done.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,94.116

<P_2,95>

<heading>

Chap. VIII.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.119

{COM:chapter_27}

The same subject continued.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.121

<$$heading>

The next morning I communicated to my wife and children the scheme I had
planned of reforming the prisoners, which they received with universal
disapprobation, alledging the impossibility and impropriety of it;
adding, that my endeavours would no way contribute to their amendment,
but might probably disgrace my calling.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.123

"Excuse me, returned I,"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.124

these people, however fallen, are still men, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.125

and that is a very good title to my affections.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.126

Good council rejected returns to enrich the giver's bosom;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.127

and though the instruction I communicate may not mend them, yet it will
assuredly mend myself.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,95.128

If these wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thousands
ready <P_2,96> to offer their ministry; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.129

but, in my opinion, the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious
as that seated upon a throne.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.130

Yes, my treasures, if I can mend them I will; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.131

perhaps they will not all despise me.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.132

Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulph, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.133

and that will be great gain; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.134

for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the human soul? "
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.135

Thus saying, I left them, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.136

and descended to the common prison, where I found the prisoners very
merry, expecting my arrival; and each prepared with some gaol trick to
play upon the doctor.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.137

Thus, as I was going to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by accident,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.138

and then asked my pardon.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.139

A second, who stood at some distance, had a knack of spitting through
his teeth, which fell in showers upon my book.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.140

A third would cry amen in such an affected tone as gave the rest great
delight.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.141

A fourth hath slily picked my pocket of my spectacles.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,96.142

But there was one whose trick gave more universal pleasure than all the
<P_2,97> rest; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.143

for observing the manner in which I had disposed my books on
the table before me, he very dextrously displaced one of them,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.144

and put an obscene jest-book of his own in the place.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.145

However I took no notice of all that this mischievous groupe of little
beings could do; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.146

but went on, perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt,
would excite mirth only the first or second time, while what was serious
would be permanent.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.147

My design succeeded, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.148

and in less than six days some were penitent, and all attentive.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.149

It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address, at thus
giving sensibility to wretches divested of every moral feeling,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.150

and now began to think of doing them temporal services also, by rendering
their situation somewhat more comfortable.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.151

Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and excess, tumultous
riot and bitter repining.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.152

Their only employment was $quarrelling {TEXT:qurrelling} among
each other, playing at cribbage, and cutting tobacco stoppers.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,97.153

From this last mode of idle industry <P_2,98> I took the hint of setting
such as chose to work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers, the
proper wood being bought by a general subscription, and when manufactured,
sold by my appointment; so that each earned something every day: a trifle
indeed, but sufficient to maintain him.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,98.154

I did not stop here, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,98.155

but instituted fines for the punishment of immorality, and rewards for
peculiar industry.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,98.156

Thus in less than a fortnight I had formed them into something social
and humane, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,98.157

and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator, who had
brought men from their native ferocity into friendship and obedience.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,98.158

And it were highly to be wished, that legislative power would thus direct
the law rather to reformation than severity.  That it would seem convinced
that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar,
but formidable.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,98.159

Then instead of our present prisons, which find or make men guilty,
which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime, and return them,
<P_2,99> if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thousands;
it were to be wished we had, as in other parts of Europe, places of
penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such
as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if
innocent.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.160

And this, but not the encreasing punishments, is the way to mend a state:
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.161

nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right which
social combinations have assumed of capitally punishing offences of a
slight nature.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.162

In cases of murder their right is obvious, as it is the duty of us all
, from the law of self-defence, to cut off that man who has shewn a
disregard for the life of another.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.163

Against such, all nature arises in arms; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.164

but it is not so against him who steals my property.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.165

Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horse
he steals is as much his property as mine.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.166

If then I have any right, it must be from a compact; made between
us, that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,99.167

But this is a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his
life, no more than <P_2,100> to take it away, as it is not his own.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.168

And next, the compact is inadequate, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.169

and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity, as there
is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, since it is
far better that two men should live, than that one man should ride.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.170

But a compact that is false between two men, is equally so between an
hundred, or an hundred thousand; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.171

for as ten millions of circles can never make a square, so the united
voice of myriads $can $not {TEXT:cannot} lend the smallest foundation
to falsehood.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.172

It is thus that reason speaks, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.173

and untutored nature says the same thing.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.174

Savages that are directed by natural law alone are very tender of the
lives of each other; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.175

they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.176

Our Saxon ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions
in times of peace; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.177

and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature
still strong upon them, scarce any crime is held capital.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,100.178

It is among the citizens of a refined <P_2,101> community that penal
laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.179

Government, while it grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.180

and as if our property were become dearer in proportion as it encreased ,
as if the more enormous our wealth, the more extensive our fears, our
possessions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with
gibbets to scare every invader.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.181

Whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiousness
of our people, that this country should shew more convicts in a year,
than half the dominions of Europe united?  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.182

Perhaps it is owing to both; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.183

for they mutually produce each other.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.184

When by indiscriminate penal laws a nation beholds the same punishment
affixed to dissimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no distinction
in the penalty, the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in
the crime, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.185

and this distinction is the bulwark of all morality:
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.186

thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.187

and new vices call for fresh restraints.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,101.188

<P_2,102>

It were to be wished then that power, instead a {COM:sic} contriving
new laws to punish vice, instead of drawing hard the cords of society
till a convulsion come to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches
as useless, before we have tried their utility, instead of converting
correction into vengeance, it were to be wished that we tried the
restrictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the
tyrant of the people.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,102.190

We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as dross,
only wanted the hand of a refiner; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,102.191

we should then find that wretches, now stuck up for long tortures,
lest luxury should feel a momentary pang, might if properly treated,
serve to sinew the state in times of danger; that, as their faces are
like ours, their hearts are so too; that few minds are so base as that

Chap. IX.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.195

{COM:chapter_28}

Happiness and misery rather the result of prudence than of virtue in
this life.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.197

Temporal evils or felicities being regarded by heaven as things merely
in themselves trifling and unworthy its care in the distribution.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.198

<$$heading>

I had now been confined more than a fortnight, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.200

but had not since my arrival been visited by my dear Olivia,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.201

and I greatly longed to see her.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.202

Having communicated my wishes to my wife, the next morning the
poor girl entered my apartment, leaning on her sister's arm.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.203

The change which I saw in her countenance struck me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.204

The numberless graces that once resided there were now fled,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.205

and the hand of death seemed to have molded every feature to alarm me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.206

Her temples were sunk, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.207

her forehead was tense, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.208

and a fatal paleness sate upon her cheek.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,103.209

<P_2,104>

"I am glad to see thee, my dear,"cried I; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.211

"but why this dejection, Livy?  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.212

I hope, my love, you have too great a regard for me, to permit
disappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.213

Be chearful child, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.214

and we yet may see happier days. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.215

"You have ever, sir,"replied she,"been kind to me,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.216

and it adds to my pain that I shall never have an opportunity of sharing
that happiness you promise.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.217

Happiness, I fear, is no longer reserved for me here;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.218

and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found distress.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.219

Indeed, sir, I wish you would make a proper submission to Mr.
Thornhill; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.220

it may, in some measure, induce him to pity you,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.221

and it will give me relief in dying. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.222

"Never child,"replied I,"never will I be brought to acknowledge my
daughter a prostitute; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.223

for tho'the world may look upon your offence with scorn, let
it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,104.224

My dear, I am no way miserable in this place, however <P_2,105> dismal
it may seem, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.225

and be assured that while you continue to bless me by living, he shall
never have my consent to make you more wretched by marrying another.
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.226

After the departure of my daughter, my fellow prisoner, who was by at this
interview, sensibly enough expostulated upon my obstinacy , in refusing a
submission, which promised to give me freedom.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.227

He observed, that the rest of my family was not to be sacrificed to
the peace of one child alone, and she the only one who had offended me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.228

"Beside,"added he,"I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know if it be just thus to
obstruct the union of man and wife, which you do at present, by refusing
to consent to a match which you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hinder, but may
render unhappy. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.229

"Sir,"replied I,"you are unacquainted with the man that oppresses us.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.230

I am very sensible that no submission I can make could procure me liberty
even for an hour.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,105.231

I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than
last <P_2,106> year, died for want.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.232

But though my submission and approbation could transfer me from hence,
to the most beautiful apartment he is possessed of; yet I would grant
neither, as something whispers me that it would be giving a sanction
to adultery.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.233

While my daughter lives, no other marriage of his shall ever be legal
in my eye.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.234

Were she removed, indeed, I should be the basest of men, from any
resentment of my own, to attempt putting asunder those who wish for
an union.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.235

No, villain as he is, I should then wish him married, to prevent the
consequences of his future debaucheries.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.236

But should I not now be the most cruel of all fathers, to sign an
instrument which must send my child to the grave, merely to avoid a
prison myself; and thus to escape one pang, break my child's heart with
a thousand? "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.237

He acquiesced in the justice of this answer, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.238

but could not avoid observing, that he feared my daughter's
life was already too much wasted to keep me long a prisoner.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,106.239

<P_2,107>

"However, {TEXT:missing_close_quote} continued he,
{TEXT:missing_open_quote} though you refuse to submit to the nephew,
I hope you have no objections to laying your case before the uncle,
who has the first character in the kingdom for every thing that is just
and good.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.241

I would advise you to send him a letter by the post, intimating all his
nephew's ill usage, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.242

and my life for it that in three days you shall have an answer.
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.243

I thank'd him for the hint, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.244

and instantly set about complying; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.245

but I wanted paper, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.246

and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provisions
, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.247

however he supplied me.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.248

For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety, to know what
reception my letter might meet with; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.249

but in the mean time was frequently solicited by my wife to submit to
any conditions rather than remain here, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.250

and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's
health.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.251

The third day and the fourth arrived, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.252

but I received no answer to my letter: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,107.253

the complaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew, were no way
likely to <P_2,108> succeed; so that these hopes soon vanished like all
my former.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.254

My mind, however, still supported itself though confinement and bad air
began to make a visible alteration in my health, and my arm that had
suffered in the fire, grew worse.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.255

But my children still sate by me, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.256

and while I was stretched on my straw, read to me by turns
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.257

or listened and wept at my instructions.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.258

But my daughter's health declined faster than mine;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.259

every message from her contributed to encrease my apprehensions and pain.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.260

The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was sent to Sir
William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that she was speechless.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.261

Now it was, that confinement was truly painful to me;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.262

my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pillow of my child,
to comfort, to strengthen her, to receive her last wishes, and teach
her soul the way to heaven!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.263

Another account came.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.264

She was expiring, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.265

and yet I was debarred the small comfort of weeping by her.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.266

My fellow prisoner, some time after, came with the last account.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.267

He bade me be patient.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,108.268

She was <P_2,109> dead!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.269

- The next morning he returned, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.270

and found me with my two little ones, now my only companions
, who were using all their innocent efforts to comfort me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.271

They entreated to read to me, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.272

and bade me not to cry, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.273

for I was now too old to weep.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.274

"And is not my sister an angel, now papa,"cried the eldest,
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.275

and why then are you sorry for her?  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.276

I wish I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my papa were with
me. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.277

"Yes,"added my youngest darling, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.278

"Heaven, where my sister is, is a finer place than this,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.279

and there are none but good people there, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.280

and the people here are very bad. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.281

Mr Jenkinson interupted their harmless prattle, by observing that now my
daughter was no more, I should seriously think of the rest of my family ,
and attempt to save my own life, which was every day declining, for want
of necessaries and wholesome air.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,109.282

He added, that it was now incumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or
resentment of my own, to the welfare of those who depended on me for
support; <P_2,110> and that I was now, both by reason and justice,
obliged to try to reconcile my landlord.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.283

"Heaven be praised,"replied I, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.284

"there is no pride left me now, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.285

I should detest my own heart if I saw either pride or resentment lurking
there.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.286

On the contrary, as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope
one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.287

No, sir, I have no resentment now, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.288

and though he has taken from me what I held dearer than all his treasures
, though he has wrung my heart, for I am sick almost to fainting, very
sick, my fellow prisoner, yet that shall never inspire me with vengeance.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.289

I am now willing to approve his marriage, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.290

and if this submission can do him any pleasure, let him know , that if I
have done him any injury, I am sorry for it. " GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.291

Mr. Jenkinson took pen and ink, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.292

and wrote down my submission nearly as I have exprest it, to which I
signed my name.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,110.293

My son was employed <P_2,111> to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill
, who was then at his seat in the country.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.294

He went, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.295

and in about six hours returned with a verbal answer.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.296

He had some difficulty, he said, to get a sight of his landlord, as the
servants were insolent and suspicious; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.297

but he accidentally saw him as he was going out upon business,
preparing for his marriage, which was to be in three days.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.298

He continued to inform us, that he stept up in the humblest manner,
and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read,
he said that all submission was now too late and unnecessary; that he
had heard of our application to his uncle, which met with the contempt
it deserved; and as for the rest, that all future applications should
be directed to his attorney, not to him.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.299

He observed, however, that as he had a very good opinion of the
discretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the most
agreeable intercessors.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,111.300

"Well, sir,"said I to my fellow prisoner,"you now discover the temper
of <P_2,112> the man that oppresses me.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.301

He can at once be facetious and cruel; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.302

but let him use me as he will, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.303

I shall soon be free, in spite of all his bolts to restrain me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.304

I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it:
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.305

this expectation cheers my afflictions, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.306

and though I leave an helpless family of orphans behind me, yet they
will not be utterly forsaken; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.307

some friend perhaps, will be found to assist them for the sake of their
poor father, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.308

and some may charitably relieve them for the sake of their heavenly
father. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.309

Just as I spoke, my wife, whom I had not seen that day before,
appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to speak.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.310

"Why, my love,"cried I,"why will you thus encrease my afflictions by
your own, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,112.311

what though no submissions can turn our severe mister, tho'he has doomed
me to die in this place of wretchedness, and though we have lost a
darling child, yet still you will find comfort in your other children
when I shall <P_2,113> be no more. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.312

"We have indeed lost,"returned she,"a darling child.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.313

My Sophia, my dearest, is gone, snatched from us, carried off by
ruffians! "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.314

"How madam,"cried my fellow prisoner, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.315

"miss Sophia carried off by villains, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.316

sure it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be? "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.317

She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.318

But one of the prisoners wives, who was present, and came in with her,
gave us a more distinct account: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.319

she informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and herself, were taking
a walk together on the great road a little way out of the village, a
post-chaise and pair drove up to them and instantly stopt.  Upon which ,
a well drest man, but not Mr. Thornhill, stepping out, clasped my
daughter round the waist, and forcing her in, bid the postillion drive on,
so that they were out of sight in a moment.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.320

"Now,"cried I,"the sum of my misery is made up, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,113.321

nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to give me another <P_2,114>
pang.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.322

What!  not one left!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.323

not to leave me one!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.324

the monster!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.325

the child that was next my heart!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.326

she had the beauty of an angel, and almost the wisdom of an angel.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.327

But support that woman, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.328

nor let her fall.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.329

Not to leave me one! "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.330

-"Alas!  my husband, {TEXT:missing_close_quote} said my wife, "you seem
to want comfort even more than I.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.331

Our distresses are great; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.332

but I could bear this and more, if I saw you but easy.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.333

They may take away my children and all the world, if they leave me but
you. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.334

My Son, who was present, endeavoured to moderate our grief;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.335

he bade us take comfort, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.336

for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.337

-"My child,"cried I,"look round the world, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.338

and see if there be any happiness left me now.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.339

Is not every ray of comfort shut out; while all our bright prospects
only lie beyond the grave! "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.340

-"My dear father,"returned he,"I hope there is still something that will
give you an interval of satisfaction; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,114.341

for I have a letter from my brother <P_2,115> George"-
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.342

"What of him, child,"interrupted I, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.343

"does he know our misery.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.344

I hope my boy $is {TEXT:his} exempt from any part of what his wretched
family suffers? "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.345

-"Yes, sir,"returned he,"he is perfectly gay, chearful, and happy.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.346

His letter brings nothing but good news; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.347

he is the favourite of his colonel, who promises to procure him the very
next lieutenancy that becomes vacant! "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.348

"And are you sure of all this,"cried my wife, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.349

"are you sure that nothing ill has befallen my boy? "
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.350

-"Nothing indeed, madam,"returned my son, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.351

"you shall see the letter, which will give you the highest pleasure;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.352

and if any thing can procure you comfort, I am sure that will.
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.353

"But are you sure,"still repeated she.  {COM:sic}"that the letter is
from himself, and that he is really so happy? " GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.354

-"Yes, Madam,"replied he, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.355

"it is certainly his, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.356

and he will one day be the credit and the support of our family!
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,115.357

-"Then I thank providence,"cried she, <P_2,116>"that my last letter to
him has miscarried. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.358

"Yes, my dear,"continued she, turning to me,"I will now confess that
tho'the hand of heaven is sore upon us in other instances, it has been
favourable here.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.359

By the last letter I wrote my son, which was in the bitterness of anger,
I desired him, upon his mother's blessing, and if he had the heart of
a man, to see justice done his father and sister, and avenge our cause.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.360

But thanks be to him that directs all things, it has miscarried,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.361

and I am at rest. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.362

"Woman,"cried I,"thou hast done very ill, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.363

and at another time my reproaches might have been more severe.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.364

Oh!  what a tremendous gulph hast thou escaped, that would have buried
both thee and him in endless ruin.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.365

Providence, indeed, has here been kinder to us than we to ourselves.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.366

It has reserved that son to be the father and protector of my children
when I shall be away.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,116.367

How unjustly did I complain of being stript of every comfort, when still
I hear that he is happy and insensible of our afflictions; still kept
<P_2,117> in reserve to support his widowed mother, and to protect his
brothers and sisters.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.368

But what sisters has he left, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.369

he has no sisters now, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.370

they are all gone, robbed from me, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.371

and I am undone. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.372

-"Father,"interrupted my son,"I beg you will give me leave to read this
letter, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.373

I know it will please you. "Upon which, with my permission, he read as
follows: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.374

Honoured Sir, I Have called off my imagination a few moments from the
pleasures that surround me, to fix it upon objects that are still more
pleasing, the dear little fire-side at home.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.375

My fancy draws that harmless groupe as listening to every line of this
with great composure.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.376

I view those faces with delight which never felt the deforming hand of
ambition or distress!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.377

But whatever your happiness may be at home, I am sure it will be some
addition to it, to hear that I am perfectly pleased with my situation,
and every way happy here.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,117.378

<P_2,118>

Our regiment is countermanded GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.380

and is not to leave the kingdom; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.381

the colonel, who professes himself my friend, takes me with him to all
companies where he is acquainted, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.382

and after my first visit I generally find myself received with encreased
respect upon repeating it.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.383

I danced last night with Lady G-, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.384

and could I forget you know whom, I might be perhaps successful.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.385

But it is my fate still to remember others, while I am myself forgotten
by most of my absent friends, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.386

and in this number, I fear, Sir, that I must consider, you;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.387

for I have long expected the pleasure of a letter from home to no purpose.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.388

Olivia and Sophia too, promised to write, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.389

but seem to have forgotten me.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.390

Tell them they are two arrant little baggages, and that I am this moment
in a most violent passion with them: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.391

yet still, I know not how, tho'I want to bluster a little, my heart is
respondent only to softer emotions.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.392

Then tell them, sir, that after all, I love them affectionately,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.393

and be assured of my ever remaining.  Your dutiful son.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,118.394

<P_2,119>

"In all our miseries,"cried I,"what thanks have we not to return ,
that one at least of our family is exempted from what we suffer.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.396

Heaven be his guard, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.397

and keep my boy thus happy to be the supporter of his widowed mother,
and the father of these two babes, which is all the patrimony I can now
bequeath him.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.398

May he keep their innocence from the temptations of want, and be their
conductor in the paths of honour. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.399

I had scarce said these words, when a noise, like that of a tumult,
seemed to proceed from the prison below; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.400

it died away soon after, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.401

and a clanking of fetters was heard along the passage that led to my
apartment.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.402

The keeper of the prison entered, holding a man all bloody, wounded and
fettered with the heaviest irons.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.403

I looked with compassion on the wretch as he approached me, but with
horror when I found it was my own son.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.404

-"My George!  My George!  and do I find thee thus.  Wounded!  Fettered!
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.405

Is this thy happiness!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.406

Is this the manner you return to me!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,119.407

O that this sight <P_2,120> could break my heart at once and let me die!
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.408

"Where, Sir, is your fortitude,"returned my son with an intrepid voice.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.409

"I must suffer, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.410

my life is forfeited, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.411

and let them take it; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.412

it is my last happiness that I have committed no murder, tho'I have lost
all hopes of pardon. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.413

I tried to restrain my passions for a few minutes in silence,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.414

but I thought I should have died with the effort -
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.415

"O my boy, my heart weeps to behold thee thus, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.416

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help it.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.417

In the moment that I thought thee blest, and prayed for thy safety,
to behold thee thus again!  Chained, wounded.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.418

And yet the death of the youthful is happy.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.419

But I am old, a very old man, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.420

and have lived to see this day.  To see my children all untimely falling
about me, while I continue a wretched survivor in the midst of ruin!
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.421

May all the curses that ever sunk a soul fall heavy upon the murderer
of my children.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.422

May he live, like me, to see -"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,120.423

<P_2,121>

"Hold, Sir,"replied my son,"or I shall blush for thee.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.425

How, sir, forgetful of your age, your holy calling, thus to arrogate the
justice of heaven, and fling those curses upward that must soon descend
to crush thy own grey head with destruction!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.426

No, Sir let it be your care now to fit me for that vile death I
must shortly suffer, to arm me with hope and resolution, to give me
courage to drink of that bitterness which must shortly be my portion.
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.427

"My child, you must not die: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.428

I am sure no offence of thine can deserve so vile a punishment.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.429

My George could never be guilty of any crime to make his ancestors
ashamed of him. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.430

"Mine, Sir,"returned my son,"is, I fear, an unpardonable one.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.431

I have sent a challenge, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.432

and that is death by a late act of Parliament.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.433

When I received my mother's letter from home, I immediately
came down, determined to punish the betrayer of our honour,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,121.434

and sent him an <P_2,122> order to meet me, which he answered, not
in person, but by his dispatching four of his domestics to seize me.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.435

I wounded one, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.436

but the rest made me their prisoner.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.437

The coward is determined to put the law in execution against me,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.438

the proofs are undeniable; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.439

and as I am the first transgressor upon the statute, I see no hopes
of pardon.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.440

But you have often charmed me with your lessons of fortitude,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.441

let me now, Sir, find them in your example. " GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.442

"And, my son, you shall find them.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.443

I am now raised above this world, and all the pleasures it can produce.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.444

From this moment I break from my heart all the ties that held it down
to earth, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.445

and will prepare to fit us both for eternity.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.446

Yes, my son, I will point out the way, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.447

and my soul shall guide yours in the ascent, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.448

for we will take our flight together.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.449

I now see and am convinced you can expect no pardon here,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.450

and I can only exhort you to seek it at that greatest tribunal where we
both shall shortly answer.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.451

But let us not be niggardly in our exhortation, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,122.452

<P_2,123>

but let all our fellow prisoners have a share: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.454

good goaler {COM:sic} let them be permitted to stand here, while I
attempt to improve them. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.455

Thus saying, I made an effort to rise from my straw,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.456

but wanted strength, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.457

and was able only to recline against the wall.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.458

The prisoners assembled according to my direction,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.459

for they loved to hear my council, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.460

my son and his mother supported me on either side,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.461

I looked GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.462

and saw that none were wanting, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.463

and then addressed them with the following exhortation.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,123.464

<P_2,124>

<heading>

Chap. X.  {COM:chapter_29} GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.467

The equal dealings of providence demonstrated with regard to the happy
and the miserable here below.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.468

That from the nature of pleasure and pain, the wretched must be
repaid the balance of their sufferings in the life hereafter.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.469

<$$heading>

My friends, my children, and fellow sufferers, when I reflect on the
distribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been
given man to enjoy, yet still more to suffer.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.471

Though we should examine the whole world, we shall not find one man so
happy as to have nothing left to wish for; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.472

but we daily see thousands who by suicide shew us they have nothing left
to hope.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.473

In this life then it appears that we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be entirely
blest, but yet we may be completely miserable!  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,124.474

<P_2,125>

Why man should thus feel pain, why our wretchedness should be requisite in
the formation of universal felicity, why, when all other systems are made
perfect by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great system
should require for its perfection, parts that are not only subordinate to
others, but imperfect in themselves?  These are questions that never can
be explained, and might be useless if known.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.476

On this subject providence has thought fit to elude our
curiosity, satisfied with granting us motives to consolation.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.477

In this situation, man has called in the friendly assistance of
philosophy, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.478

and heaven seeing the incapacity of that to console him, has given him
the aid of religion.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.479

The consolations of philosophy are very amusing, but often fallacious.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.480

It tells us that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them
; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have miseries here,
life is short, and they will soon be over.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.481

Thus do these consolations destroy each other; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,125.482

for if life is a place of comfort, its <P_2,126> shortness must be misery,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.483

and if it be long, our griefs are protracted.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.484

Thus philosophy is weak; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.485

but religion comforts in an higher strain.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.486

Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for
another abode.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.487

When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will
find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here, while the
wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices, shrinks from
his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance
of heaven.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.488

To religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our
truest comfort; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.489

for if already we are happy, it is a pleasure to think that we can make
that happiness unending, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.490

and if we are miserable, it is very consoling to think that there is a
place of rest.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.491

Thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliss, to the
wretched a change from pain.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.492

But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar
rewards to the unhappy; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,126.493

the sick, the naked, the <P_2,127> houseless, the heavy-laden, and
the prisoner, have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.494

The author of our religion every where professes himself the wretch's
friend, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.495

and unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all his caresses upon
the forlorn.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.496

The unthinking have censured this as partiality, as a preference without
merit to deserve it.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.497

But they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven itself
to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as
to the miserable.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.498

To the first eternity is but a single blessing, since at most it but
encreases what they already possess.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.499

To the latter it is a double advantage; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.500

for it diminishes their pain here, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.501

and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.502

But providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.503

for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths
the passage there.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.504

The wretched have had a long familiarity with every face of terror.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.505

The man of sorrows lays himself quietly down, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,127.506

he has no possessions <P_2,128> to regret, and but few ties to stop his
departure: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.507

he feels only nature's pang in the final separation,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.508

and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.509

for after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death
opens in the constitution, nature kindly covers with insensibility.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.510

Thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the
happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and in heaven all
that superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.511

And this superiority, my friends, is no small advantage,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.512

and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.513

for though he was already in heaven, and felt all the raptures it
could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that
he had once been wretched and now was comforted, that he had known
what it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.514

Thus, my friends, you see religion does what philosophy could never do:
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,128.515

it shews <P_2,129> the equal dealings of heaven to the happy and the
unhappy, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.516

and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.517

It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal
hopes to aspire after it; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.518

but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here, the poor
have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable,
when crowned with endless felicity hereafter; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.519

and even though this should be called a small advantage, yet being an
eternal one, it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of
the great may have exceeded by intenseness.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.520

These are therefore the consolations which the wretched have peculiar
to themselves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.521

in other respects they are below them.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.522

They who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.523

To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what
none either believe or practise.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,129.524

The men who have the necessaries of living are not <P_2,130> poor,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.525

and they who want them must be miserable.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.526

Yes, my friends, we must be miserable.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.527

No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.528

can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease to
the throbbings of a broken heart.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.529

Let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist
all these.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.530

Alas!  the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain!
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.531

Death is slight, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.532

and any man may sustain it; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.533

but torments are dreadful GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.534

and these no man can endure.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.535

To us then, my friends, the promises of happiness in heaven should be
peculiarly dear; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.536

for if our reward be in this life alone we are then indeed of all men
the most miserable.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,130.537

When I look round these gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to
confine us; this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place,
those shackles that tyranny has imposed, or crime made necessary;
when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans , O my
friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for <P_2,131> these.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.538

To fly through regions unconfined as air, to bask in the sunshine of
eternal bliss, to carrol over endless hymns of praise, to have no master
to threaten or insult us, but the form of goodness himself for ever in
our eyes, when I think of these things, death becomes the messenger of
very glad tidings; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.539

when I think of these things, his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of
my support; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.540

when I think of these things, what is there in life worth having?
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.541

When I think of these things, what is there that should not be spurned
away?  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.542

Kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.543

but we, humbled as we are, should yearn for them.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.544

And shall these things be ours?  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.545

Ours they will certainly be if we but try for them;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.546

and what is a comfort, we are shut out from many temptations that would
retard our pursuit.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.547

Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and what is
still a comfort, shortly too; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.548

for if we look back on past life, it appears but a very short span,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.549

and whatever we may think of the rest of life, it will yet be found of
less duration; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,131.550

<P_2,132>

as we grow older, the days seem to grow shorter,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.552

and our intimacy with time, ever lessens the perception of his stay.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.553

Then let us take comfort now, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.554

for we shall soon be at our journey's end; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.555

we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.556

and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while
mocks the weary traveller with the view, and like his horizon, still
flies before him; yet the time will certainly and shortly come, when we
shall cease from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world
shall no more tread us to the earth; when we shall think with pleasure on
our sufferings below; when we shall be surrounded with all our friends,
or such as deserved our friendship; when our bliss shall be unutterable,
and still, to crown all, unending.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.557

Happier prospects begin to appear.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.561

Let us be inflexible, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.562

and fortune will at last change in our favour.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.563

<$$heading>

When I had thus finished and my audience was retired, the goaler
{COM:sic}, who was one of the most humane of his profession, hoped I would
not be displeased, as what he did was but his duty, observing that he
must be obliged to remove my son into a stronger cell, but that he should
be permitted to revisit me every morning.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.565

I thanked him for his clemency, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.566

and grasping my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the
great duty that was before him.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.567

I again, therefore laid me down, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,132.568

and one of my little ones sate by my bedside reading, when Mr.
Jenkinson entering, informed me that there was news of my daughter;
<P_2,134> for that she was seen by a person about two hours before in a
strange gentleman's company, and that they had stopt at a neighbouring
village for refreshment, and seemed as if returning to town.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.569

He had scarce delivered this news, when the gaoler came with looks
of haste and pleasure, to inform me, that my daughter was found.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.570

Moses came running in a moment after, crying out that his sister Sophy
was below, and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.571

Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.572

and with looks almost wild with pleasure, ran to kiss me in a transport
of affection.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.573

Her mother's tears and silence also shewed her pleasure.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.574

-"Here, papa,"cried the charming girl,"here, is the brave man to whom
I owe my delivery; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.575

to this gentleman's intrepidity I am indebted for my happiness and
safety -"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.576

A kiss from Mr. Burchell, whose pleasure seemed even greater than
hers, interrupted what she was going to add.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,134.577

<P_2,135>

"Ah, Mr Burchell,"cried I,"this is but a wretched habitation you now
find us in; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.579

and we are now very different from what you last saw us.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.580

You were ever our friend: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.581

we have long discovered our errors with regard to you, and repented of
our ingratitude.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.582

After the vile usage you then received at my hands I am almost ashamed
to behold your face; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.583

yet I hope $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} forgive me, as I was deceived by a
base ungenerous wretch, who, under the mask of friendship, has undone
me. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.584

"It is impossible,"replied Mr. Burchell,"that I should forgive you,
as you never deserved my resentment.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.585

I partly saw your delusion then, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.586

and as it was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity it!
"GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.587

"It was ever my conjecture,"cried I,"that your mind was noble;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.588

but now I find it so.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.589

But tell me, my dear child, how hast thou been relieved, or who the
ruffians were who carried thee away? "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,135.590

<P_2,136>

"Indeed, Sir,"replied she,"as to the $villain {TEXT:villian} who carried
me off, I am yet ignorant.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.592

For as my mamma and I were walking out, he came behind us,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.593

and almost before I could call for help, forced me into the post chaise
, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.594

and in an instant the horses drove away.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.595

I met several on the road, to whom I cried out for assistance;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.596

but they disregarded my entreaties.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.597

In the mean time the ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from
crying out: GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.598

he flattered and threatened by turns, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.599

and swore that if I continued but silent, he intended no harm.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.600

In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he, had drawn up,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.601

and whom should I perceive at some distance but your old friend Mr.
Burchell, walking along with his usual swiftness, with the great stick
for which we used so much to ridicule him.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.602

As soon as we came within hearing, I called out to him by name,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.603

and entreated his help.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.604

I repeated my exclamations several times, upon which, with a very loud
voice, he bid the postillion stop; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.605

but the boy took no notice, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,136.606

<P_2,137>

but drove on with still greater speed.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.608

I now thought he could never overtake us, when in less than a minute I saw
Mr. Burchell come running up by the side of the horses, and with
one blow knock the postillion to the ground.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.609

The horses when he was fallen soon stopt of themselves,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.610

and the ruffian stepping out, with oaths and menaces drew his sword,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.611

and ordered him at his peril to retire; GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.612

but Mr. Burchell running up, shivered his sword to pieces,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.613

and then pursued him for near a quarter of a mile;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.614

but he made his escape.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.615

I was at this time come out myself, willing to assist my deliverer;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.616

but he soon returned to me in triumph.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.617

The postillion, who was recovered, was going to make his escape too;
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.618

but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and
drive back to town.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.619

Finding it impossible to resist, he reluctantly complied, though
the wound he had received seemed, to me at least, to be dangerous.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,137.620

He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along, so that he at
last excited Mr. Burchell's <P_2,138> compassion, who, at my
request, exchanged him for another at an inn where we called on our
return. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.621

"Welcome then,"cried I,"my child, and thou her gallant deliverer,
a thousand welcomes.  GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.622

Though our chear is but wretched, yet our hearts are ready to receive you.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.623

And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have delivered my girl, if you
think her a recompence she is yours, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.624

if you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine, take her,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.625

obtain her consent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine.
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.626

And let me tell you, Sir that I give you no small treasure,
GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.627

she has been celebrated for beauty it is true, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.628

but that is not my meaning, GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.629

I give you up a treasure in her mind. "GOLDSMITH-1766-2,2,138.630
