SPECIAL ASSIZE, MONMOUTH.  FROST-1840-1,162.3

<font> Thursday, 2 January <$$font> 1840.  FROST-1840-1,162.4

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Will your Lordship permit me
to mention, in the presence of the Attorney-general - your Lordships
reserved the point which was argued last night for further consideration.
FROST-1840-1,162.6

I presume, my Lord, the effect of that would be to place Mr. Frost
in precisely the same situation as if it had been decided in his favour.
FROST-1840-1,162.7

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It must be, my Lord,
the same as in all other cases.  FROST-1840-1,162.8

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> It is a very common course
to take at assizes, when a point arises which suggests a difficulty to
the judges.  FROST-1840-1,162.9

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Your Lordships $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} suppose that I am making any objection to that course.
FROST-1840-1,162.10

I am merely asking this, and the Attorney-general himself being here,
makes it a matter very easy to be arranged, that in the event of your
Lordships being of opinion that the objection ought to have prevailed
at the trial, Mr. Frost may be placed in the same situation as
if it had prevailed.  FROST-1840-1,162.11

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> No doubt about that;
FROST-1840-1,162.12

he will be in the same situation as if we had decided it at the time.
FROST-1840-1,162.13

If, upon consideration and consultation with the judges, we think the
objection ought to have prevailed, it will be as if it had prevailed at
the moment.  FROST-1840-1,162.14

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> And the verdict will be
accordingly.  FROST-1840-1,162.15

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> No.  FROST-1840-1,162.16

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Mr. Frost, my Lord,
will be in the same situation as all the rest of Her Majesty's subjects
under similar circumstances.  FROST-1840-1,162.17

This case does not differ from any other case.  FROST-1840-1,162.18

Mr. Serjeant <font> Ludlow.  <$$font> There is nothing new in
this case, Sir Frederick Pollock.  FROST-1840-1,162.19

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My learned friend,
Mr. Serjeant Ludlow, says, there is nothing new in this case;
FROST-1840-1,162.20

I dare say there is not.  FROST-1840-1,162.21

But why that observation should be addressed to me, and not to the court,
I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} understand; FROST-1840-1,162.22

I have difficulties enough to struggle with in performing this
overwhelming duty, as far as <P_163> my own feelings are concerned,
without having to meet such observations as those; FROST-1840-1,163.23

and I would request my learned friend not to suppose I come uninstructed
in points of law; FROST-1840-1,163.24

I am aware of that which he states.  FROST-1840-1,163.25

My attention was first called, in professional life, to the case
of a person named Walsh, convicted of defrauding another party.
FROST-1840-1,163.26

It was decided, that he ought to have been acquitted; FROST-1840-1,163.27

and yet he remained under attainder for the rest of his life.
FROST-1840-1,163.28

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> I do not know any thing
about that case; FROST-1840-1,163.29

I have explained the position in which the prisoner will stand if this
point should be decided by the judges in his favour.  FROST-1840-1,163.30

It will be precisely the same as if we had now so decided it.
FROST-1840-1,163.31

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> If that is understood, my Lord,
I have no further observation to make.  FROST-1840-1,163.32

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It is understood that the
state of things will be precisely the same in this case as in all other
cases, where the learned judges reserve a point for the consideration
of their learned brethren assembled at Westminster.  FROST-1840-1,163.33

There is no special course to be adopted here.  FROST-1840-1,163.34

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Not at all.  FROST-1840-1,163.35

If there is a conviction, and the judges are of opinion that the objection
is well-founded, a pardon will be issued at the recommendation of the
Secretary of State, as a matter of course.  FROST-1840-1,163.36

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> With all deference, my Lord, that
is not placing the subject in the same situation.  FROST-1840-1,163.37

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> That is the only course that
could be pursued; because you can find no instance, in a criminal case ,
of a judge reserving a point for the consideration of all the judges
, in the same way as a judge does at <font> nisi prius.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,163.38

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I thought, my Lord, that in this
case the presence of the Attorney-general representing the Crown might
make a difference.  FROST-1840-1,163.39

I am aware that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be done at the assizes;
FROST-1840-1,163.40

but with all deference to the court and my learned friend, Mr.
Serjeant Ludlow, it did appear to me that the presence of the
Attorney-general here, representing the Crown, and consenting that the
verdict should be entered for the defendant if this point were decided
in his favour, would make a difference.  FROST-1840-1,163.41

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> My Lord, in this case the
law must take its course.  FROST-1840-1,163.42

At present your Lordship overrules the objection, subject to the
consideration that it may undergo by your Lordships, assisted by your
learned brethren at Westminster.  FROST-1840-1,163.43

Mr. Justice <font> Williams.  <$$font> With precisely the
same consequences that follow in other cases of the same kind.
FROST-1840-1,163.44

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Exactly, my Lord, in other
cases of the same kind; FROST-1840-1,163.45

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} consent, filling the situation that I do,
<P_164> to deviate from the established practice that has existed in
England for centuries.  FROST-1840-1,164.46

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Then I can only say that it
is high time that that practice was altered by a competent authority.
FROST-1840-1,164.47

I am very much surprised that a different practice has not prevailed,
by the Attorney-general consenting.  FROST-1840-1,164.48

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> My Lord, there should
surely be an end to these interlocutory observations.  FROST-1840-1,164.49

I wish to treat my learned friend with the courtesy and respect to which
he is entitled, FROST-1840-1,164.50

and I hope I have done so, and shall continue to do so;
FROST-1840-1,164.51

but I must deprecate these irregular observations.  FROST-1840-1,164.52

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Certainly.  FROST-1840-1,164.53

<heading>

<font> Samuel Simmons sworn.  <$$font> FROST-1840-1,164.55

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, there was another
objection to the witness.  FROST-1840-1,164.57

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> Yes.  FROST-1840-1,164.58

I am now about to examine him on the <font> voir dire.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,164.59

<bracket> To the witness.  <$$bracket> Where do you live?
FROST-1840-1,164.60

- Newport.  FROST-1840-1,164.61

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> It must be understood that we
are allowed to question him on the <font> voir dire?  <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,164.62

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Of course.
FROST-1840-1,164.63

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Is there some objection made
to the description?  FROST-1840-1,164.64

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I understood so.
FROST-1840-1,164.65

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It is not to be understood
that that objection is to be deferred for further consideration?
FROST-1840-1,164.66

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> By no means, my Lord.
FROST-1840-1,164.67

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> <bracket> <font>
To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> In what parish do you live?
FROST-1840-1,164.68

- In the parish of St. Woollos.  FROST-1840-1,164.69

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> I think it may be
convenient if we hand up to your Lordships a copy of the printed list.
FROST-1840-1,164.70

<bracket> <font> The list was handed up.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,164.71

This is in page 10.  FROST-1840-1,164.72

It is alphabetical, my Lord.  FROST-1840-1,164.73

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Do you know
the borough of Newport?  FROST-1840-1,164.74

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,164.75

Is the parish of St. Woollos in the borough of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,164.76

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,164.77

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined on the <$$font> Voir dire.  FROST-1840-1,164.79

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> You live at Newport?
FROST-1840-1,164.81

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,164.82

Do you know the parish of St. Woollos?  FROST-1840-1,164.83

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,164.84

Is it not a very large parish?  FROST-1840-1,164.85

- I believe it is.  FROST-1840-1,164.86

Much larger than the borough of Newport?  FROST-1840-1,164.87

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,164.88

I do not know the nature of the borough of Newport, not altogether.
FROST-1840-1,164.89

<P_165>

Do you not know that there are several townships?  FROST-1840-1,165.91

Do you know the limits of the borough of Newport?  FROST-1840-1,165.92

- My Lord, the limits of the borough of Newport, I believe, will appear
from the Municipal Corporation Act.  FROST-1840-1,165.93

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Yes.  FROST-1840-1,165.94

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> From the Boundary Act?
FROST-1840-1,165.95

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> From the Boundary Act.
FROST-1840-1,165.96

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I dare say we can agree
upon that.  FROST-1840-1,165.97

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> <bracket> <font> To the
witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Is not the parish a very large parish?
FROST-1840-1,165.98

- Yes; I believe it is.  FROST-1840-1,165.99

Does it not go beyond the borough of Newport?  FROST-1840-1,165.100

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say for a certainty of that.
FROST-1840-1,165.101

Have not you always understood that it is a very large parish?
FROST-1840-1,165.102

- Yes, it is very large.  FROST-1840-1,165.103

And embracing land round about that is not in the borough of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,165.104

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,165.105

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, perhaps we could agree
upon the fact without calling any other evidence.  FROST-1840-1,165.106

I believe there is no doubt about this, that the parish of St.
Woollos is a very large parish, of which the borough of Newport is part.
FROST-1840-1,165.107

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I am told, which I am very
ready to admit, that the parish of St. Woollos is more extensive
than the borough of Newport.  FROST-1840-1,165.108

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Does he live in that part of
the parish which is in the borough?  FROST-1840-1,165.109

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord.
FROST-1840-1,165.110

These are the facts.  FROST-1840-1,165.111

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Those are not all the facts.
FROST-1840-1,165.112

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> The whole of the borough of
Newport, I am informed, is in the parish of St. Woollos, the
parish being a very large parish, including more than the borough,
but the whole of the borough being in the parish.  FROST-1840-1,165.113

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Is that so?  FROST-1840-1,165.114

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> No, my Lord, that is not so.
FROST-1840-1,165.115

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Will you tell me what you
understand to be the fact?  FROST-1840-1,165.116

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> There is a part of the
borough in another parish.  FROST-1840-1,165.117

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, I understand the fact
to be as I represented it at first, that that was the condition of things
before the Municipal Corporations Act, since which there has been added to
the borough for the purposes of that Act <paren> your Lordships will say
whether that is for all purposes <$$paren> a portion of another parish.
FROST-1840-1,165.118

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Part of the parish in
question.  FROST-1840-1,165.119

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> We may take that as admitted.
FROST-1840-1,165.120

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I believe, my Lord, that
is the fact.  FROST-1840-1,165.121

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> But, perhaps, your Lordships would
permit <P_166> me to call a witness and prove one fact, inasmuch as this
objection, if it be of any importance, extends to a very considerable
number of witnesses.  FROST-1840-1,166.122

I see in the page before me at least five or six, FROST-1840-1,166.123

and I am told that there are many in the other pages.
FROST-1840-1,166.124

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Will you have the goodness to
read that part of the Act which adds the parish, and for what purpose
it is added?  FROST-1840-1,166.125

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> The Act, my Lord, is not in
court, FROST-1840-1,166.126

we have sent for it.  FROST-1840-1,166.127

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Will your Lordship permit me, in
the mean time, to ask the witness with reference to his own residence?
FROST-1840-1,166.128

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> How long have
you lived in the place where you live now?  FROST-1840-1,166.129

- I have lived in the place about twelve months, but in the town about
seventeen years.  FROST-1840-1,166.130

Will you endeavour to explain where it is that you live now?
FROST-1840-1,166.131

- I live just below the Salutation.  FROST-1840-1,166.132

An inn or a public-house, called the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,166.133

- Yes, an inn.  FROST-1840-1,166.134

Where is the Salutation, then?  FROST-1840-1,166.135

- In the borough of Newport, I believe.  FROST-1840-1,166.136

But is it in any street?  FROST-1840-1,166.137

- Yes; it stands at the side of Cardiff-street; FROST-1840-1,166.138

it stands at the side of the street that goes to Pill.
FROST-1840-1,166.139

Do you mean that Cardiff-street leads out of the street in which the
Salutation is?  FROST-1840-1,166.140

- No, the street is called Cardiff-street.  FROST-1840-1,166.141

Then, the Salutation is in Cardiff-street?  FROST-1840-1,166.142

- No, on a piece of waste ground, standing on the side of Cardiff-street .
FROST-1840-1,166.143

Is your house in Cardiff-street?  FROST-1840-1,166.144

- No.  FROST-1840-1,166.145

Your house, you say, is a little below the Salutation?
FROST-1840-1,166.146

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,166.147

In what direction will you be going if you leave the Salutation, and go
towards your house; FROST-1840-1,166.148

where does the street or road lead to?  FROST-1840-1,166.149

- It goes off towards Pill; FROST-1840-1,166.150

you turn on the right, just below the Salutation inn.
FROST-1840-1,166.151

What is the name of the road, or place or street in which your house is?
FROST-1840-1,166.152

- It is a tram-road that the coals and iron go down by.
FROST-1840-1,166.153

There is no other road than a tram-road?  FROST-1840-1,166.154

- No.  FROST-1840-1,166.155

Are there any other houses near yours?  FROST-1840-1,166.156

- Yes; there are a dozen houses in the same place.  FROST-1840-1,166.157

Can you tell me the name of the place, or street, or road, or whatever
you call it?  FROST-1840-1,166.158

- There is a place below that, used to be called Mountjoy;
FROST-1840-1,166.159

I do not know any name to the street.  FROST-1840-1,166.160

How far is your house from the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,166.161

- About a quarter of a mile; FROST-1840-1,166.162

it may be a little better.  FROST-1840-1,166.163

Do you get out of the town, that is, the place where the houses
discontinue, before you get to your house, FROST-1840-1,166.164

or are there houses all the way?  FROST-1840-1,166.165

- There are houses all the way.  FROST-1840-1,166.166

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> From the Westgate Inn?
FROST-1840-1,166.167

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,166.168

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Do you mean that there is any
row of houses that leads from the Salutation up to your house?
FROST-1840-1,166.169

- No, not a <P_167> row from the Salutation; FROST-1840-1,167.170

you go past the Salutation a little bit, FROST-1840-1,167.171

and then it turns on the right hand.  FROST-1840-1,167.172

Are there houses still all the way to your house?  FROST-1840-1,167.173

- Yes, all the way.  FROST-1840-1,167.174

Is there no name to the place in which those houses are?
FROST-1840-1,167.175

- I never heard a name; FROST-1840-1,167.176

it is a tram-road, which all the coal goes down, and iron;
FROST-1840-1,167.177

it never had any name to it.  FROST-1840-1,167.178

Did you never have letters directed to you?  FROST-1840-1,167.179

- No, never in my life.  FROST-1840-1,167.180

Nor any body near where you are?  FROST-1840-1,167.181

- Not that I know of; not my family.  FROST-1840-1,167.182

Is your house rated?  FROST-1840-1,167.183

- No.  FROST-1840-1,167.184

Neither to the poor-rate nor the borough-rate?  FROST-1840-1,167.185

- No; my house is only 6 <font> +L.  <$$font> a year.
FROST-1840-1,167.186

If I understand you, this tram-road goes right past your house?
FROST-1840-1,167.187

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,167.188

By the tram-road is the only way in which you can get to your house?
FROST-1840-1,167.189

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,167.190

Where does that tram-road go to?  FROST-1840-1,167.191

- It goes all the way up to the hills.  FROST-1840-1,167.192

From Newport up to the hills?  FROST-1840-1,167.193

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,167.194

I will merely ask you the question, FROST-1840-1,167.195

do you, of your own knowledge, know how far the ancient borough extends?
FROST-1840-1,167.196

- No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say how far.  FROST-1840-1,167.197

Do you know how far the parish extends?  FROST-1840-1,167.198

- No, I do not.  FROST-1840-1,167.199

What is the most distant part of the parish from your house that you
know of; FROST-1840-1,167.200

how far does it go?  FROST-1840-1,167.201

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say; FROST-1840-1,167.202

for miles all round the place, FROST-1840-1,167.203

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say how far.  FROST-1840-1,167.204

Does it not extend for miles beyond the town?  FROST-1840-1,167.205

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say how far the parish goes.
FROST-1840-1,167.206

Not exactly; FROST-1840-1,167.207

but you used the expression"miles; FROST-1840-1,167.208

"do you not know that it extends for miles round the town?
FROST-1840-1,167.209

- I know for miles round the town.  FROST-1840-1,167.210

<heading>

<font> Re-examined on the <$$font> Voir dire.  FROST-1840-1,167.212

<$$heading>

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> You say you live near
the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,167.214

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,167.215

Do you remember the 4th of November?  FROST-1840-1,167.216

- Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Stay; FROST-1840-1,167.217

we are waiting for the Municipal Reform Act.  FROST-1840-1,167.218

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> We may assume that it is here.
FROST-1840-1,167.219

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> I want to refer to that Act in
order to see for what purpose another parish is added to the borough.
FROST-1840-1,167.220

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font>"For the purposes of the
Act,"probably, are the words.  FROST-1840-1,167.221

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Very possibly.
FROST-1840-1,167.222

<P_168>

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> It is possible that the Municipal
Act may show in some way or other what the connexion between the other
parish and the borough really is; FROST-1840-1,168.224

but if it should be necessary, we will inquire of some person who does
know, and ascertain the fact; because I understand that the ancient
borough is within the parish, but forms a very small portion of that
parish.  FROST-1840-1,168.225

Certain additions are made for the particular purposes of the Act to
the ancient borough; FROST-1840-1,168.226

those additions may not be within the parish.  FROST-1840-1,168.227

But with regard to the parish itself, it is a very large parish of
several miles in extent; FROST-1840-1,168.228

the parish is not in the borough; FROST-1840-1,168.229

but on the contrary, the borough is in the parish, and forming a small
part of the parish.  FROST-1840-1,168.230

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He lives in both; in the
part of the parish that is in the borough.  FROST-1840-1,168.231

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> So it stands, my Lord.
FROST-1840-1,168.232

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> That may be so.  FROST-1840-1,168.233

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Now, my Lord, subject to
any objection that my learned friend may make to the facts as they stand,
we propose to proceed to examine the witness.  FROST-1840-1,168.234

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> If your objection is
founded upon the Municipal Corporation Act, the Act should be here;
FROST-1840-1,168.235

in future, if you found objections upon any Act, be so good as to have
it here.  FROST-1840-1,168.236

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I made inquiries, my Lord,
FROST-1840-1,168.237

and I understood that there would be immediate access to the statutes.
FROST-1840-1,168.238

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> I merely suggested that, because
for the future it would save time if, when you founded an objection upon
an Act of Parliament, you had the Act here; FROST-1840-1,168.239

for though we are supposed to keep the statutes in our heads, we do not.
FROST-1840-1,168.240

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Your Lordship can hardly
suppose that the counsel would bring all the statutes from London.
FROST-1840-1,168.241

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> No, certainly not.
FROST-1840-1,168.242

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> We understood that they would
be here.  FROST-1840-1,168.243

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> The gentleman who instructs us sent
throughout the town for the Act, in the hope of being able to procure
it, FROST-1840-1,168.244

but was unable.  FROST-1840-1,168.245

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, it would be really some
convenience if your Lordships would order, as sometimes is the case,
that the statutes should be put upon the table.  FROST-1840-1,168.246

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The town-clerk will have it.
FROST-1840-1,168.247

There must be a copy of the Acts somewhere in the town.
FROST-1840-1,168.248

Mr. <font> Mallion, <$$font> <paren> the Crier.  <$$paren> The
under-sheriff has gone for the town-clerk.  FROST-1840-1,168.249

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> We had better go on,
FROST-1840-1,168.250

and you can make your objection afterwards.  FROST-1840-1,168.251

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I have no objection, my Lord,
to that course.  FROST-1840-1,168.252

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> In fact it is a general
objection to this description.  FROST-1840-1,168.253

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, it applies to
many others.  FROST-1840-1,168.254

<P_169>

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> It is an insufficient description.
FROST-1840-1,169.256

There can be no objection to the witness being examined conditionally.
FROST-1840-1,169.257

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> <bracket> <font> To the
witness <$$font> <$$bracket>.  Do you remember Monday morning the 4th
of November?  FROST-1840-1,169.258

Do you know Mr. Frost, the prisoner at the bar?
FROST-1840-1,169.260

Did you see him on that Monday morning, the 4th of November?
FROST-1840-1,169.262

Where did you see him?  FROST-1840-1,169.264

How far is that machine from the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,169.268

- Nearly a mile.  FROST-1840-1,169.269

Was he alone, FROST-1840-1,169.270

or were any persons with him?  FROST-1840-1,169.271

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,169.274

What had they?  FROST-1840-1,169.275

- A great many with guns.  FROST-1840-1,169.276

Any other weapons or instruments?  FROST-1840-1,169.277

- Yes, a great many with scythes, spits, pikes and mandrils, and all those
kind of things; pieces of iron on large long sticks.  FROST-1840-1,169.278

What sort of spits do you mean?  FROST-1840-1,169.279

- Roasting spits.  FROST-1840-1,169.280

Did you hear Mr. Frost say any thing that morning?
FROST-1840-1,169.281

- I heard him say nothing that morning, not as we walked up the hill up
by the turnpike.  FROST-1840-1,169.282

In what direction were Mr. Frost and the persons going when you
saw them going by the machine?  FROST-1840-1,169.283

- Mr. Frost was in the front.  FROST-1840-1,169.284

Towards what place were they going?  FROST-1840-1,169.285

Do you know the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,169.286

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,169.287

Were they going in that direction?  FROST-1840-1,169.288

- Yes; the people came up Stowe-hill, in the direction to the Westgate
Inn.  FROST-1840-1,169.289

At what time was this?  FROST-1840-1,169.290

- I think it was about nine o'clock, or a little past.
FROST-1840-1,169.291

In the morning, or night?  FROST-1840-1,169.292

- In the morning; FROST-1840-1,169.293

it might be past nine.  FROST-1840-1,169.294

Very well; that is as near as you can tell.  FROST-1840-1,169.295

Do you know whether they went to the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,169.296

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,169.297

Did you hear Mr. Frost say any thing that morning?
FROST-1840-1,169.298

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,169.299

What was it you heard him say?  FROST-1840-1,169.300

- They made a stop when they came to the top of Stowe-hill, by the
turnpike; FROST-1840-1,169.301

they made a halt.  FROST-1840-1,169.302

Is the turnpike nearer to the Westgate Inn than the machine?
FROST-1840-1,169.303

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,169.304

What was it you heard said by Mr. Frost at the turnpike?
FROST-1840-1,169.305

- I heard him say,"Let us go towards the town, and show ourselves to
the town. "FROST-1840-1,169.306

After that was said, which way did they go?  FROST-1840-1,169.307

- Down the hill.  FROST-1840-1,169.308

Was that towards the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,169.309

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,169.310

<P_170>

Did they go to the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,170.312

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.313

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Stop a moment.
FROST-1840-1,170.314

He said something about the word"halt. "FROST-1840-1,170.315

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font>"There was first the word
'halt'given, FROST-1840-1,170.316

and then they stopped. "FROST-1840-1,170.317

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Did he say by whom?
FROST-1840-1,170.318

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> I was going to ask.
FROST-1840-1,170.319

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Did you hear
by whom the word"halt"was given?  FROST-1840-1,170.320

- No, I did not.  FROST-1840-1,170.321

Did you go in the same direction with Mr. Frost, and those people?
FROST-1840-1,170.322

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-1,170.323

You say they went to the Westgate; FROST-1840-1,170.324

what part of the Westgate did they go to?  FROST-1840-1,170.325

- They went round to the Westgate gates.  FROST-1840-1,170.326

Is that picture like the Westgate Inn?  <bracket> <font> Showing a
drawing to the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,170.327

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.328

Do you know it?  FROST-1840-1,170.329

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.330

Just point to the part which you say they went to.  FROST-1840-1,170.331

Have your Lordships one of them?  FROST-1840-1,170.332

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> No, nor the plan of the town.
FROST-1840-1,170.333

<bracket> <font> It was handed up to their Lordships.  <$$font>
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,170.334

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> Which way did they come
towards the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,170.335

- Down the hill.  FROST-1840-1,170.336

Is the hill in this part?  FROST-1840-1,170.337

Do you know enough of this picture to tell me whether the hill comes
down here?  - <bracket> <font> Pointing it out.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,170.338

- Yes, it does.  FROST-1840-1,170.339

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> If your Lordship will be
good enough to look at this - FROST-1840-1,170.340

he says they came down the hill, which is on this side of the inn, -
<bracket> <font> Pointing it out.  FROST-1840-1,170.341

<$$font> <$$bracket> Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> The
west side?  FROST-1840-1,170.342

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> The west side, my Lord.
FROST-1840-1,170.343

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> You say that
the road coming down to the right hand side of the Westgate Inn, as you
now look at it, is called Stowe-hill?  FROST-1840-1,170.344

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.345

And that is the way those persons came?  FROST-1840-1,170.346

- They came down Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,170.347

When they came down Stowe-hill, which way did they turn?
FROST-1840-1,170.348

- They turned round on the right.  FROST-1840-1,170.349

Would that be in front of the inn?  FROST-1840-1,170.350

- In front of the inn.  FROST-1840-1,170.351

And when they turned round, what part of the inn did they go to?
FROST-1840-1,170.352

- They went round towards the yard.  FROST-1840-1,170.353

Is the yard on the other side of the inn from Stowe-hill?
FROST-1840-1,170.354

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.355

Has the house two bow-windows, or two bows?  FROST-1840-1,170.356

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.357

Does the yard turn up by the side of one of those bows?
FROST-1840-1,170.358

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,170.359

<P_171>

Does the yard turn up by the bow farthest from Stowe-hill?
FROST-1840-1,171.361

- The farthest from Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,171.362

Are there any gates to that yard?  FROST-1840-1,171.363

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,171.364

Were those gates open or shut when those people proceeded towards them?
FROST-1840-1,171.365

- They were shut.  FROST-1840-1,171.366

When the people went towards those gates, did you see Mr. Frost?
FROST-1840-1,171.367

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,171.368

Where was he?  FROST-1840-1,171.369

- He was on the paving, by the anchor-shop, close by.
FROST-1840-1,171.370

Whereabouts is the anchor-shop; FROST-1840-1,171.371

is that beyond the yard, or on this side?  FROST-1840-1,171.372

- Adjoining the yard.  FROST-1840-1,171.373

Did you see whether the people attempted to go into the yard?
FROST-1840-1,171.374

- They did.  FROST-1840-1,171.375

Could they get in?  FROST-1840-1,171.376

- No.  FROST-1840-1,171.377

Did you hear Mr. Frost say any thing on their attempting to get in?
FROST-1840-1,171.378

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,171.379

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The anchor-shop forms the
other side of the yard?  FROST-1840-1,171.380

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> I believe it does, my Lord.
FROST-1840-1,171.381

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Is the
anchor-shop the other side of the yard, the bow window being on one side
and the anchor-shop on the other?  FROST-1840-1,171.382

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,171.383

You say, on the men attempting to go in, and not being able to do so,
Mr. Frost said something; FROST-1840-1,171.384

what did he say?  FROST-1840-1,171.385

- He said,"Turn round, FROST-1840-1,171.386

and show your appearance to the front. "FROST-1840-1,171.387

How near were you to Mr. Frost when he used that expression?
FROST-1840-1,171.388

- I was close by.  FROST-1840-1,171.389

Upon that expression being used, in what direction did the people move?
FROST-1840-1,171.390

- They turned round to the Westgate.  FROST-1840-1,171.391

Did you see the door of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,171.392

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,171.393

What part of the Westgate did they go to?  FROST-1840-1,171.394

- To the front.  FROST-1840-1,171.395

Did they go near the door?  FROST-1840-1,171.396

In what manner?  FROST-1840-1,171.398

- They went in at the door; FROST-1840-1,171.399

they rushed in at the door.  FROST-1840-1,171.400

- The door was open.  FROST-1840-1,171.402

They rushed in at the door?  FROST-1840-1,171.403

What was the next thing you heard or saw?  FROST-1840-1,171.405

- Firing.  FROST-1840-1,171.406

From what quarter did the firing proceed?  FROST-1840-1,171.407

- It began by the door.  FROST-1840-1,171.408

Can you tell me whether the firing began from any of the persons who
had gone up in the manner you have stated, or from any body else?
FROST-1840-1,171.409

- I think it began from the people that went up to the Westgate door.
FROST-1840-1,171.410

Can you tell me whether there was any person at the door with a gun
before those people went up; FROST-1840-1,171.411

did you see any body with a gun before they went up?  FROST-1840-1,171.412

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,171.413

<P_172>

When you heard the firing begin, what became of you; FROST-1840-1,172.415

did you remain, FROST-1840-1,172.416

or did you go away?  FROST-1840-1,172.417

- I stayed there a bit.  FROST-1840-1,172.418

And then what did you do; FROST-1840-1,172.419

what became of you then?  FROST-1840-1,172.420

- I went over to Mr. Mallock's, that keeps the china-shop,
FROST-1840-1,172.421

and desired him to shut the shop up FROST-1840-1,172.422

- Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Never mind what you desired him to
do; FROST-1840-1,172.423

you were asked where you went.  FROST-1840-1,172.424

Mr. <font> Solicitor-General.  <$$font> You say you stayed a bit;
FROST-1840-1,172.425

just tell the court how long you mean by"a bit? "FROST-1840-1,172.426

- I stayed there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.
FROST-1840-1,172.427

What firing took place while you were there?  FROST-1840-1,172.428

- A great deal of firing.  FROST-1840-1,172.429

Did you see whether that firing came from the people who had marched up
to the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,172.430

- Yes; I saw some of them firing.  FROST-1840-1,172.431

Where was Mr. Frost the last time you saw him, before you went
to Mallock's?  FROST-1840-1,172.432

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> My Lord, I do not understand the last
answer as applied to the question, FROST-1840-1,172.433

my learned friend put the question,"Did the firing come from the persons
in front of the house? "FROST-1840-1,172.434

The witness's answer was,"I saw some of them firing. "
FROST-1840-1,172.435

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font>"I saw some of the people
firing who had gone up to the Westgate. "FROST-1840-1,172.436

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord; so I understood;
FROST-1840-1,172.437

I ought, perhaps, to have objected to the question.  FROST-1840-1,172.438

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> I wish you would;
FROST-1840-1,172.439

I would thank you for any suggestions; FROST-1840-1,172.440

I put them as cautiously as I can.  FROST-1840-1,172.441

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> I know you do; FROST-1840-1,172.442

spoken of as coming down Stowe-hill, and afterwards going to the front
of the inn, when you went to Mallock's, FROST-1840-1,172.444

or what had become of them?  FROST-1840-1,172.445

- Some had run away.  FROST-1840-1,172.446

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> You put a question respecting
Mr. Frost; FROST-1840-1,172.447

I am sorry I interposed at the moment; FROST-1840-1,172.448

I have not heard the answer.  FROST-1840-1,172.449

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> He did not give it;
FROST-1840-1,172.450

I will just continue this for a moment.  FROST-1840-1,172.451

of the people ran away?  FROST-1840-1,172.452

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,172.453

Had there been any firing from any part of the Westgate Inn from the
inside before those people ran away?  FROST-1840-1,172.454

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say as there had; FROST-1840-1,172.455

there was a great deal of firing between them both; FROST-1840-1,172.456

you could not hardly see the Westgate for smoke.  FROST-1840-1,172.457

When you say there was a great deal of firing between them both, whom
do you mean by"both? "FROST-1840-1,172.458

- The soldiers and the mob.  FROST-1840-1,172.459

Where were the soldiers that you speak of?  FROST-1840-1,172.460

- In the Westgate Inn.  FROST-1840-1,172.461

Had those soldiers fired before the people ran away?  FROST-1840-1,172.462

- I suppose <P_173> they had, some of them; FROST-1840-1,173.463

there was a great deal of firing; FROST-1840-1,173.464

I saw them throw their arms down and run away, a great quantity.
FROST-1840-1,173.465

When you say you suppose the soldiers had fired, did you see any
firing come from any part of the Westgate or from any soldiers?
FROST-1840-1,173.466

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,173.467

Where was Mr. Frost the last time you saw him, before you went
to Mallock's?  FROST-1840-1,173.468

- On the paving.  FROST-1840-1,173.469

Near where?  FROST-1840-1,173.470

- Near the anchor-shop.  FROST-1840-1,173.471

Can you form any judgment so as to tell the court about what number of
men you think there were there that morning?  FROST-1840-1,173.472

- I suppose there were 5,000 or 6,000.  FROST-1840-1,173.473

Where were those men, about that number, when you first saw them?
FROST-1840-1,173.474

- I saw them up by the machine.  FROST-1840-1,173.475

You say there having been a good deal of firing, a great quantity were
running away when you went to Mallock's?  FROST-1840-1,173.476

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,173.477

Did you see any more of what took place at that time after you went
to Mallock's?  FROST-1840-1,173.478

- No.  FROST-1840-1,173.479

Did you see any men fall, as though shot, before you went to Mallock's?
FROST-1840-1,173.480

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,173.481

How many did you see fall?  FROST-1840-1,173.482

- I saw two fall.  FROST-1840-1,173.483

Whereabouts were those men that you saw fall when they fell?
FROST-1840-1,173.484

- There was one by the door.  FROST-1840-1,173.485

Where was the other?  FROST-1840-1,173.486

- Just opposite the bow-window.  FROST-1840-1,173.487

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> What door?  FROST-1840-1,173.488

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> What door do you mean?
FROST-1840-1,173.489

- The Westgate door.  FROST-1840-1,173.490

The inn door do you mean?  FROST-1840-1,173.491

- The inn door.  FROST-1840-1,173.492

Where did you say the other man was when he fell?  FROST-1840-1,173.493

- Opposite the bow-window nearly.  FROST-1840-1,173.494

Is that the bow-window which you have spoken of before, by the yard?
FROST-1840-1,173.495

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,173.496

How long did you remain at Mallock's before you came out?
FROST-1840-1,173.497

- Not long.  FROST-1840-1,173.498

Just give the court some idea of the time that you mean by"not long;
"FROST-1840-1,173.499

do you mean five minutes or ten, or a quarter of an hour, or what time?
FROST-1840-1,173.500

- About five minutes.  FROST-1840-1,173.501

What was going on when you came out from Mallock's?  FROST-1840-1,173.502

- The men were running in all quarters.  FROST-1840-1,173.503

The soldiers were seeing what was going on, so as to keep the Westgate
as clear as they could.  FROST-1840-1,173.504

Did you remain there until the mob was quite dispersed?
FROST-1840-1,173.505

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,173.506

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> In Mallock's?  FROST-1840-1,173.507

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> Not in Mallock's;
FROST-1840-1,173.508

he said he came out of Mallock's in about five minutes.
FROST-1840-1,173.509

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> How long
was it before the mob dispersed after you came out of Mallock's?
FROST-1840-1,173.510

- They were dispersed in about a quarter of an hour.  FROST-1840-1,173.511

<P_174>

When you first saw those men at the machine was there any noise or
hallooing?  FROST-1840-1,174.513

- Boys were hurrahing.  FROST-1840-1,174.514

Did you see any person raise his arm, or do any thing of that sort?
FROST-1840-1,174.515

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,174.516

Who was that?  FROST-1840-1,174.517

- Mr. Frost.  FROST-1840-1,174.518

Just describe what you saw him do?  FROST-1840-1,174.519

I saw him rise {COM:sic} his hand like that.  FROST-1840-1,174.520

- <bracket> <font> A gesture to enforce silence.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,174.521

And after that quarter of an hour you went home?  FROST-1840-1,174.522

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,174.523

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> My Lord, I find it necessary to
put a question or two.  FROST-1840-1,174.524

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> You will be so good as
to hear the cross-examination first, and then the re-examination;
FROST-1840-1,174.525

very likely the question will be asked in the course of that.
FROST-1840-1,174.526

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Mr. Kelly.  <$$font> FROST-1840-1,174.528

You say you have lived for about 12 months at your present house?
FROST-1840-1,174.530

Have you not during that time lived at the Salutation?
FROST-1840-1,174.532

Were you examined before the magistrates?  FROST-1840-1,174.534

- I was, at the Westgate Inn.  FROST-1840-1,174.535

How long after the occurrence you have been talking of, how long after
this affray?  FROST-1840-1,174.536

- I was examined on Monday in the afternoon of the same day that it
took place.  FROST-1840-1,174.537

Were you examined more than once?  FROST-1840-1,174.538

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,174.539

When were you examined again?  FROST-1840-1,174.540

- On the Tuesday.  FROST-1840-1,174.541

That was the last time, was it not?  FROST-1840-1,174.542

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,174.543

Did you not at that time live at the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,174.544

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,174.545

Did you not say that you lived at the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,174.546

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,174.547

You never said that at that time you lived at the Salutation?
FROST-1840-1,174.548

- Not at that time.  FROST-1840-1,174.549

When did you live at the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,174.550

- I suppose I had left the Salutation about three weeks before that -
three weeks or a month.  FROST-1840-1,174.551

And have you never since then lived at the Salutation?
FROST-1840-1,174.552

- No, not since.  FROST-1840-1,174.553

How long were you at the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,174.554

- I was there about four months, I suppose, or better.
FROST-1840-1,174.555

What is your business now?  FROST-1840-1,174.556

- How do you get your livelihood?  FROST-1840-1,174.557

- Working about the town; any thing I can get to do; FROST-1840-1,174.558

I was in a shop for three years.  FROST-1840-1,174.559

I am not asking what you were for three years; but how you get your
livelihood now?  FROST-1840-1,174.560

- Any thing I can get to do; any kind of work.  FROST-1840-1,174.561

How did you get your livelihood at the time that this business took place?
FROST-1840-1,174.562

- I was raising potatoes at that time.  FROST-1840-1,174.563

You have said that you know Mr. Frost, FROST-1840-1,174.564

and you have told us of some things that Mr. Frost has said;
FROST-1840-1,174.565

how long have you known Mr. Frost?  FROST-1840-1,174.566

- I have known him these many years.  FROST-1840-1,174.567

<P_175>

Did you know that he was a magistrate?  FROST-1840-1,175.569

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,175.570

How long was he a magistrate?  FROST-1840-1,175.571

- He was a magistrate a good while.  FROST-1840-1,175.572

How long, as near as you can say?  FROST-1840-1,175.573

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say how many years.  FROST-1840-1,175.574

Some years?  FROST-1840-1,175.575

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,175.576

Was he not twice mayor of Newport?  FROST-1840-1,175.577

- He was mayor once to my knowledge; FROST-1840-1,175.578

I do not know more than once.  FROST-1840-1,175.579

You say that you knew he was a magistrate, or had been;
FROST-1840-1,175.580

how did you know that?  FROST-1840-1,175.581

- I saw him in the town; FROST-1840-1,175.582

I heard people say that he was a magistrate.  FROST-1840-1,175.583

Was that the only way you knew he was a magistrate?  FROST-1840-1,175.584

- I never applied to him at any time.  FROST-1840-1,175.585

Were you never before him?  FROST-1840-1,175.586

- No.  FROST-1840-1,175.587

Never at all?  FROST-1840-1,175.588

- No.  FROST-1840-1,175.589

You are quite sure of that?  FROST-1840-1,175.590

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,175.591

Where did you live before you went to this place that you have spoken of?
FROST-1840-1,175.592

- The Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,175.593

Yes; FROST-1840-1,175.594

or before you went to live in the house you are now in;
FROST-1840-1,175.595

you say you have been in that house about a year?  FROST-1840-1,175.596

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,175.597

Was it while you occupied that house that you were at the Salutation?
FROST-1840-1,175.598

- Yes; I occupied that house before I went to the Salutation.
FROST-1840-1,175.599

You went from that to the Salutation, FROST-1840-1,175.600

and you went back again to that house?  FROST-1840-1,175.601

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,175.602

Where did you live before you went to that house?  FROST-1840-1,175.603

- The other side of Cardiff-road.  FROST-1840-1,175.604

I think you said you have lived in Newport for 17 years or thereabouts?
FROST-1840-1,175.605

- Yes, very near that.  FROST-1840-1,175.606

How many miles now, to your knowledge, does this parish of St.
Woollos extend?  FROST-1840-1,175.607

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,175.608

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> In future it would be
more convenient that if any objection is taken to the description, the
party should be sworn and examined upon the <font> voir dire.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,175.609

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> What I should wish
is, that my learned friend should not mix the cross-examination upon
the merits with the examination upon the <font> voir dire.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,175.610

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> That is very desirable,
FROST-1840-1,175.611

for it confuses one's notes.  FROST-1840-1,175.612

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> I will take care, my Lord, to do so.
FROST-1840-1,175.613

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> In future it must be understood
that the examination on the <font> voir dire <$$font> terminates the
dispute as to the description of the witness, FROST-1840-1,175.614

and when he is admitted there is an end of the objection.
FROST-1840-1,175.615

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, it was only while
the Act of Parliament was sent for that he was conditionally examined.
FROST-1840-1,175.616

I will now ask respecting the transaction.  FROST-1840-1,175.617

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> When did <P_176>
you first see the door of the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,176.618

- I saw it as we came round down Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,176.619

Was that before the people assembled in front?  FROST-1840-1,176.620

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,176.621

You say the door was then open?  FROST-1840-1,176.622

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,176.623

Was any body there?  FROST-1840-1,176.624

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,176.625

Who was there?  FROST-1840-1,176.626

- A lot of special constables.  FROST-1840-1,176.627

Was the door closed?  FROST-1840-1,176.628

- I do not know that it was.  FROST-1840-1,176.629

How long was it after the people had arrived there before any of them
got into the house?  FROST-1840-1,176.630

- Not long.  FROST-1840-1,176.631

But what do you call"not long? "FROST-1840-1,176.632

- They got in directly, as soon as they turned round.
FROST-1840-1,176.633

Turned round where FROST-1840-1,176.634

- turned round the corner?  FROST-1840-1,176.635

- Round towards the Westgate door.  FROST-1840-1,176.636

Was that before the firing had commenced?  FROST-1840-1,176.637

- Yes, when they turned round.  FROST-1840-1,176.638

My question is, whether any of them had got into the house before the
firing commenced?  FROST-1840-1,176.639

- They began to fire as soon as ever they got in; FROST-1840-1,176.640

as soon as a few got within the inside of the door the firing commenced.
FROST-1840-1,176.641

How long do you say you remained after that time?  FROST-1840-1,176.642

- I remained there about half an hour, in one place and another.
FROST-1840-1,176.643

I do not mean"one place and another,"but at the spot where the multitude
were?  FROST-1840-1,176.644

- I did not stay at that place long.  FROST-1840-1,176.645

But how long; FROST-1840-1,176.646

you have represented that you stayed there during a part of the firing?
FROST-1840-1,176.647

- I stood there about five minutes, I suppose.  FROST-1840-1,176.648

Am I to understand you that you swear you believe you stood there
about five minutes after some of them had entered the house?
FROST-1840-1,176.649

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,176.650

Did you make a deposition before the magistrates; that is, did you
sign any paper like this upon which your evidence was put down?
FROST-1840-1,176.651

- I was taken to the Westgate.  FROST-1840-1,176.652

So I understood you to have said, FROST-1840-1,176.653

and you were sworn FROST-1840-1,176.654

and gave evidence?  FROST-1840-1,176.655

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,176.656

Then I ask you, was not your evidence put down in writing and signed
by you?  FROST-1840-1,176.657

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,176.658

<bracket> <font> The Depositions were handed to Mr. Kelly.
<$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,176.659

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Just look at that; FROST-1840-1,176.660

I presume that is your mark?  FROST-1840-1,176.661

- That is it, I believe.  FROST-1840-1,176.662

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Now, my Lord, I believe the more
correct course is to have the deposition read.  FROST-1840-1,176.663

I will, with your Lordships'permission, have it read now,
FROST-1840-1,176.664

and then I have one or two questions to put upon it.  FROST-1840-1,176.665

<bracket> <font> The Deposition of Samuel Simmons was read, as follows:
<$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,176.666

"Samuel Simmons, sworn, says, I am a labourer, FROST-1840-1,176.667

and live at the Salutation, in the town of Newport.  FROST-1840-1,176.668

Between eight and <P_177> nine o'clock yesterday morning I was at the
machine; FROST-1840-1,177.669

I saw there a great crowd of persons, some with guns, some with spits,
some with pikes, and all kind of tools; FROST-1840-1,177.670

they were marching when I saw them; FROST-1840-1,177.671

they came up the lane by the Friars; FROST-1840-1,177.672

I saw ever so many at their head; FROST-1840-1,177.673

I saw Mr. Frost at their head; FROST-1840-1,177.674

I did not see him give any directions; FROST-1840-1,177.675

the boys were hallooing, FROST-1840-1,177.676

and Frost put up his hands to stop them; FROST-1840-1,177.677

they stopped at the turnpike, where Mr. Frost turned round,
and told them they had better show themselves to the town first;
FROST-1840-1,177.678

they went down Stowe-hill; FROST-1840-1,177.679

Frost was walking by their side; FROST-1840-1,177.680

I walked down the hill all the way with them; FROST-1840-1,177.681

I saw them go to the entrance gate into the Westgate yard, which they
found fastened.  FROST-1840-1,177.682

Mr. Frost was then at the head of them.  FROST-1840-1,177.683

I heard him say to the mob,'Now you must turn round and make your
appearance in the front. 'FROST-1840-1,177.684

I was not three yards from Frost at the time.  FROST-1840-1,177.685

I heard him say nothing else; FROST-1840-1,177.686

they turned round as he directed them, FROST-1840-1,177.687

and went in front of the Westgate Inn; FROST-1840-1,177.688

they rushed in at the door; FROST-1840-1,177.689

I heard the guns fired, FROST-1840-1,177.690

and I went over to Mr. Mallock's door; FROST-1840-1,177.691

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell; FROST-1840-1,177.692

I know the prisoner Walters; FROST-1840-1,177.693

I did not see him in the crowd; FROST-1840-1,177.694

it was nearly ten o'clock, I suppose, the last time I saw Frost near
the Westgate. "FROST-1840-1,177.695

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> You have heard that read;
FROST-1840-1,177.696

I now ask the question I asked you before; FROST-1840-1,177.697

do you mean to say, upon your oath, that you did not say you lived at
the Salutation Inn?  FROST-1840-1,177.698

- I did not say so: FROST-1840-1,177.699

I live below the Salutation Inn.  FROST-1840-1,177.700

Is it true or false that you swore what is here set down:"I am a labourer,
FROST-1840-1,177.701

and live at the Salutation, in the town of Newport? " FROST-1840-1,177.702

- Not at that time; FROST-1840-1,177.703

I did not live at the Salutation.  FROST-1840-1,177.704

I am not asking you whether you lived at the Salutation, but whether
you swore so?  FROST-1840-1,177.705

- No, I did not swear that I lived at the Salutation; FROST-1840-1,177.706

I was not there at that time, but by the Salutation.  FROST-1840-1,177.707

You lived by the Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,177.708

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,177.709

Did you not tell me just now you lived a quarter of a mile from the
Salutation?  FROST-1840-1,177.710

- No; FROST-1840-1,177.711

not a stone's throw I live from the Salutation.  FROST-1840-1,177.712

FROST-1840-1,177.716

whereabouts is the Friars; FROST-1840-1,177.717

how near is the Friars to the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,177.718

- About a quarter of a mile, or better.  FROST-1840-1,177.719

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> I shall have a question to
ask with regard to the matter upon the <font> voir dire <$$font>;
FROST-1840-1,177.720

I thought it better not to embarrass your Lordship's note by asking
that now.  FROST-1840-1,177.721

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> You had better ask it here,
I should think.  FROST-1840-1,177.722

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> You had better conclude your
re-examination now.  FROST-1840-1,177.723

<P_178>

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, that would
be better.  FROST-1840-1,178.725

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> Is the Friars further
from the Westgate Inn than the machine, or nearer?  FROST-1840-1,178.726

- Further.  FROST-1840-1,178.727

Do you understand my question; FROST-1840-1,178.728

I want to know which is the nearest to the Westgate Inn, the Friars or
the weighing-machine?  FROST-1840-1,178.729

- The Friars is the nearest.  FROST-1840-1,178.730

Is the Friars in the road from the machine to the Westgate?
FROST-1840-1,178.731

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,178.732

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> One of the jury wished to put
a question.  FROST-1840-1,178.733

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> What was the question, sir,
you wished to put?  FROST-1840-1,178.734

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> Simmons stated, my Lord, that they
halted at the machine, FROST-1840-1,178.735

and afterwards he said that they marched; FROST-1840-1,178.736

I wish to put the question to him, whom does he mean by"they?
FROST-1840-1,178.737

"Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Whom did you
mean by "they,"when you said,"after they halted, they marched?
"FROST-1840-1,178.738

- All the mob.  FROST-1840-1,178.739

<font> Foreman.  <$$font> Was there any body directing the mob when they
marched then?  FROST-1840-1,178.740

- Nobody, except Mr. Frost; FROST-1840-1,178.741

he said, they were to go towards the town, and show themselves to
the town.  FROST-1840-1,178.742

You stated that Frost was on the pavement, by the anchor-shop, and that
he said,"show your appearance to the front;"FROST-1840-1,178.743

do you mean to swear that those were the exact words that Mr.
Frost spoke to the men?  FROST-1840-1,178.744

- <bracket> Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> You are quite
right, sir, in putting the question, if you have any doubt.  <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,178.745

- That was as near as I could understand it.  FROST-1840-1,178.746

You stated, also, that there were soldiers in the Westgate Inn;
FROST-1840-1,178.747

do you know, of your own knowledge, that there were soldiers in the
Westgate at the time?  FROST-1840-1,178.748

- Yes, there were soldiers in the Westgate Inn.  FROST-1840-1,178.749

Did you see them?  FROST-1840-1,178.750

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,178.751

You have also stated that you saw Frost before you went to Mallock's
house; FROST-1840-1,178.752

how long after the firing commenced did you see him?  FROST-1840-1,178.753

- I did not see him long after the firing began; FROST-1840-1,178.754

he was out of my sight.  FROST-1840-1,178.755

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> This matter of
description, I suppose, your Lordships would wish to dispose of now.
FROST-1840-1,178.756

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> <$$bracket> <font> To the witness.
<$$font> <$$bracket> I, perhaps, have not quite understood you;
FROST-1840-1,178.757

but how far is your present house from the Salutation?
FROST-1840-1,178.758

- Not 100 yards.  FROST-1840-1,178.759

To the best of your knowledge, is it about 100 yards, or rather less?
FROST-1840-1,178.760

- Rather less.  FROST-1840-1,178.761

About 90 yards, perhaps?  FROST-1840-1,178.762

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,178.763

Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether that house of yours is within
the boundary of the borough of Newport, the old borough of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,178.764

- Indeed, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say; FROST-1840-1,178.765

I never paid any rates or taxes, FROST-1840-1,178.766

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,178.767

<P_179>

Now, I have only one more question to ask you upon this point;
FROST-1840-1,179.769

you have said that the parish of St. Woollos extends for miles
round; FROST-1840-1,179.770

I want to know what is the most distant place from the borough
of Newport that you know of in the parish of St. Woollos?
FROST-1840-1,179.771

- I know of one place, the other side of Stowe a good way,
FROST-1840-1,179.772

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} mention the place's name.  FROST-1840-1,179.773

How far off is the most distant place that you know?  FROST-1840-1,179.774

- About two miles.  FROST-1840-1,179.775

And in what direction is that; towards Cardiff, or towards Chepstow?
FROST-1840-1,179.776

- Neither way.  FROST-1840-1,179.777

Which way then?  FROST-1840-1,179.778

- Towards Stowe church.  FROST-1840-1,179.779

Do you know whether that is east, west, north or south?
FROST-1840-1,179.780

- I think it is south.  FROST-1840-1,179.781

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> He must be wrong in that.
FROST-1840-1,179.782

I should think, my Lord, that my learned friend might raise this point
by the admission that I made at once to my learned friend, Sir Frederick
Pollock, that the parish extends beyond the borough.  FROST-1840-1,179.783

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> The parish extends beyond the
boundary of the borough.  FROST-1840-1,179.784

Does not that answer your purpose?  FROST-1840-1,179.785

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Not exactly, my Lord, because there
is a difference between its extending beyond the boundary and its being
of considerable extent, and forming a great proportion of the parish.
FROST-1840-1,179.786

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Does it signify whether it is
an acre or 20 miles?  FROST-1840-1,179.787

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> I think your Lordship will find that
makes a difference.  FROST-1840-1,179.788

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> There is another fact;
FROST-1840-1,179.789

the place where the witness describes his house to have been is 90
yards from the Salutation, and in the direction towards Cardiff.
FROST-1840-1,179.790

Mr. <font> Attorney general.  <$$font> He says just the contrary.
FROST-1840-1,179.791

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> He says not towards Cardiff.
FROST-1840-1,179.792

- <bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Is it towards
Pillgwenlly?  FROST-1840-1,179.793

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,179.794

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> It is the same thing,
FROST-1840-1,179.795

and I am told that the Salutation Inn, or at all events, a point within
90 yards, is the boundary of the borough; so that where he lives is not
within the borough.  FROST-1840-1,179.796

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Perhaps it will be more convenient ,
as the witness does not appear to know it of his own knowledge, to prove
the fact?  FROST-1840-1,179.797

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I presume, my Lord, that I
am at liberty to call a witness to prove the boundary of the borough?
FROST-1840-1,179.798

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> You are raising an objection ,
on the ground of mis-description; FROST-1840-1,179.799

I think you have a right to do that when the witness does not know
it himself.  FROST-1840-1,179.800

<P_180>

<heading>

<font> Thomas Prothero, Esq., sworn on the <$$font> Voir dire.
FROST-1840-1,180.803

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> You have been long acquainted
with the boundaries of the borough of Newport, the old borough?
FROST-1840-1,180.805

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} speak to the boundary of the old borough
very distinctly, FROST-1840-1,180.806

but I believe that the boundary of the old borough is somewhere about
the Salutation Inn; FROST-1840-1,180.807

my reason for saying that is, that the Salutation was always licensed
by the magistrates of the borough before the Corporation Act.
FROST-1840-1,180.808

Have you held some situation connected with the borough?
FROST-1840-1,180.809

- Yes; I held the situation of town clerk for a great many years.
FROST-1840-1,180.810

Did they walk the boundaries?  FROST-1840-1,180.811

- They never did for a great many years, that I remember;
FROST-1840-1,180.812

I never perambulated the borough.  FROST-1840-1,180.813

You say that the Salutation Inn is within the boundary?
FROST-1840-1,180.814

- I think the Salutation Inn is within the boundary of the old borough;
FROST-1840-1,180.815

and my reason for thinking so is, that the magistrates of the old borough
licensed it.  FROST-1840-1,180.816

But had you not your attention once directed to the situation of some
property there, by the question coming before the court here, the
other court?  FROST-1840-1,180.817

- I do not recollect; FROST-1840-1,180.818

if you will remind me of any circumstance, perhaps I may recollect it;
FROST-1840-1,180.819

but at present, I do not.  FROST-1840-1,180.820

Do you remember an action conducted by a solicitor of the name of Evans,
where the plaintiff was nonsuited, where the cause in part turned, I
am told, upon the fact of the Salutation Inn being within the borough?
FROST-1840-1,180.821

- I really do not; FROST-1840-1,180.822

perhaps you can mention some other circumstances; FROST-1840-1,180.823

but I have scarcely a doubt in my own mind that the Salutation was within
the limits of the old borough.  FROST-1840-1,180.824

Is it at the extremity of the limits?  FROST-1840-1,180.825

- I think it must be very near the extremity of the old, and the
commencement of the new borough.  FROST-1840-1,180.826

How many years were you town clerk?  FROST-1840-1,180.827

- I think about five or six and twenty years.  FROST-1840-1,180.828

Do you know where this man lives?  FROST-1840-1,180.829

- Now that I hear the man give his evidence, from his description I
do know.  FROST-1840-1,180.830

Is not that without the boundary of the old borough?  FROST-1840-1,180.831

- I believe there is an old road near the barn that he speaks of,
called Mountjoy Farm, that was the boundary of the old borough;
FROST-1840-1,180.832

but I can only say that from belief.  FROST-1840-1,180.833

I ask you, having been 25 years the town clerk, whether, to the best of
your knowledge and acquaintance with the borough, the place that he has
described is not without the borough?  FROST-1840-1,180.834

- I really $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,180.835

I ask you your belief?  FROST-1840-1,180.836

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say; FROST-1840-1,180.837

it must be very near <P_181> the limits of the old borough, and very
near the commencement of that part of the parish that was comprised in
the borough.  FROST-1840-1,181.838

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> That was added to the
borough?  FROST-1840-1,181.839

- That was added to the borough.  FROST-1840-1,181.840

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Were you the town clerk at the
time that the Reform Bill passed?  FROST-1840-1,181.841

- Yes, I was.  FROST-1840-1,181.842

Did you not yourself, personally, give instructions with regard to the
boundary of the borough, before it was enlarged?  FROST-1840-1,181.843

- I did not; FROST-1840-1,181.844

I did not act as town clerk for several years before I ceased to hold
the office.  FROST-1840-1,181.845

Who did?  FROST-1840-1,181.846

- Sir Thomas Phillips, my partner.  FROST-1840-1,181.847

Perhaps you will be able to tell me whether the parish of
St. Woollos does not extend many miles round the borough?
FROST-1840-1,181.848

- Yes, it does.  FROST-1840-1,181.849

The old borough, I believe, was entirely within it?  FROST-1840-1,181.850

- The old borough was entirely within it.  FROST-1840-1,181.851

And formed a very small part of it?  FROST-1840-1,181.852

- Not a small part.  FROST-1840-1,181.853

Is it a half, or a third, or a tenth?  FROST-1840-1,181.854

- It is certainly very much more than a tenth; FROST-1840-1,181.855

but I should not think that the extent of surface was half.
FROST-1840-1,181.856

Perhaps not a quarter?  FROST-1840-1,181.857

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,181.858

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined on the <$$font> Voir dire.  FROST-1840-1,181.860

<$$heading>

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> The new borough,
I understand, extends beyond the place where this man lives?
FROST-1840-1,181.862

- Yes; in one direction it extends, perhaps, half a mile beyond.
FROST-1840-1,181.863

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Now, my Lord, I will just call
your Lordship's attention to the other point, for which I think one of
your Lordships desired to see the Boundary Act; FROST-1840-1,181.864

that is an Act"to settle and describe the divisions of counties, and
the limits of boroughs, in so far as respects the election of Members
to serve in Parliament;"FROST-1840-1,181.865

therefore, that Act, I presume, does not extend to the borough of Newport
for any other purposes.  FROST-1840-1,181.866

The question then is, whether the description,"Samuel Simmons, of the
parish of St. Woollos, in the borough of Newport, in the county
of Monmouth, labourer,"is a good description.  FROST-1840-1,181.867

Now, we are entitled, my Lord, to have the name - FROST-1840-1,181.868

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font>"The name, profession, and
place of abode,"are the words of the statute.  FROST-1840-1,181.869

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord; FROST-1840-1,181.870

and to say that he resides in the parish of St. Woollos,
in the borough of Newport, appears to me to be a mis-description:
FROST-1840-1,181.871

it should be,"in the borough of Newport, in the parish of St.
Woollos;"because the borough of Newport is a part of the parish, and is
in the parish; FROST-1840-1,181.872

but the parish of St. Woollos is not in the borough of Newport,
FROST-1840-1,181.873

there is only a part of it in the borough; FROST-1840-1,181.874

and if the borough of Newport <P_182> is only a part of the parish of
St. Woollos, and no part of the borough of Newport is in any
other parish, it does seem very absurd - FROST-1840-1,182.875

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> If it be material , there
is part of the borough of Newport in another parish.  FROST-1840-1,182.876

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> No, not of the old borough;
FROST-1840-1,182.877

and I submit that this must be taken to be not the new, but the old
borough.  FROST-1840-1,182.878

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He is living in the borough
of Newport; that is, every man who was acquainted with his place of
abode would say it was in the borough.  FROST-1840-1,182.879

If it had been out of the new borough of Newport, and only in the
old borough, then your objection would have been the other way,
that it was not what was popularly known as the borough of Newport.
FROST-1840-1,182.880

Every information is given by this description.  FROST-1840-1,182.881

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Now, my Lord, allow me to ask,
whether in a parish like the parish of Lambeth, it would be sufficient
to say that a person was residing in that parish, or that he was residing
in the parish of Marylebone.  FROST-1840-1,182.882

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Here are two descriptions
given: FROST-1840-1,182.883

he is residing in the borough, FROST-1840-1,182.884

and he is residing in that part of the parish which is also in the
borough.  FROST-1840-1,182.885

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It is perfectly true that he
lives in the parish of St. Woollos, FROST-1840-1,182.886

and he also lives in the borough of Newport; at all events according to
the common boundaries.  FROST-1840-1,182.887

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> The moment your Lordship
decides that the new borough is sufficient, I, of course, abandon the
objection, that this description must have reference to the old borough.
FROST-1840-1,182.888

But I would ask your Lordship this: FROST-1840-1,182.889

I believe there is a part of the parish of Lambeth in the borough of
Southwark, FROST-1840-1,182.890

would it do to say,"of the parish of Lambeth, in the borough of
Southwark,"because a party lived in a portion of the borough of Southwark,
that was also in the parish of Lambeth?  FROST-1840-1,182.891

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> That would be the same case,
would it not?  FROST-1840-1,182.892

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, it would.
FROST-1840-1,182.893

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Now you are upon the point
that there is no street named?  FROST-1840-1,182.894

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I am, my Lord, upon that point,
that there is no information given beyond the parish, so as to enable any
person to find where the witness is to be met with.  FROST-1840-1,182.895

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The man says there is no
name to the street where he lives, FROST-1840-1,182.896

but it is by the side of a tram-road that leads up to the hills; so that
upon inquiry you would find him out.  FROST-1840-1,182.897

<P_187>

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Does your Lordship call
upon us to answer this objection?  FROST-1840-1,187.905

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Is there not a case
upon this subject where the description was applied to Lambeth?
FROST-1840-1,187.906

<P_188>

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I am not aware of that;
FROST-1840-1,188.908

the practice has been to describe the witnesses by the parish, as I am
informed by Mr. Maule.  FROST-1840-1,188.909

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Your Lordships will not take my
learned friend's statement of the practice.  FROST-1840-1,188.910

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} believe that there is any such practice.
FROST-1840-1,188.911

Before the Attorney-general begins, your Lordships will pardon me for
referring to a case in which an attorney, whose address must be given
under the statute of George II., called himself of"New Inn,
London. "FROST-1840-1,188.912

That was a mere technical mistake, which could mislead no one;
FROST-1840-1,188.913

but we all know that New Inn is in the city of Westminster.
FROST-1840-1,188.914

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> That was not a want of
certainty.  FROST-1840-1,188.915

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> No, my Lord; FROST-1840-1,188.916

I have referred to that as bearing upon the first part of the argument.
FROST-1840-1,188.917

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> In Stone's case, my Lord, in 6th
Term Reports, an objection was made on the ground of the uncertainty of
the description of one of the jurymen; FROST-1840-1,188.918

his place of abode was stated to be Grafton-street; FROST-1840-1,188.919

and it was contended, that as there are several streets of that name,
there should have been something to distinguish which Grafton-street
was meant; FROST-1840-1,188.920

but the objection was overruled.  FROST-1840-1,188.921

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> There the street was named.
FROST-1840-1,188.922

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Under the statute to
which my learned friend has referred, requiring the place of abode of
the attorney to be stated, your Lordship is aware that it has been held
that it is enough to state the town in which he resides, and that too
in the case of the town of Birmingham, consisting of 30,000 inhabitants.
FROST-1840-1,188.923

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The objection in this case
shapes itself in a double form; first, that this is a mis-description; and
secondly, that there is a want of certainty in it.  FROST-1840-1,188.924

Now the description given in this list is, that Samuel Simmons, to whom
the objection applies, is"of the parish of St. Woollos, in the
borough of Newport, in the county of Monmouth. "FROST-1840-1,188.925

It appears to me, that this is true in every part and particular which
is set down in this list.  FROST-1840-1,188.926

He is a resident in the parish of St. Woollos, in the borough of
Newport, in the county of Monmouth.  FROST-1840-1,188.927

There was no intention to enter into any detail as to how much of the
parish of St. Woollos is in the borough of Newport, or how much
out of it, but merely to give such a description as should be true in
matter of fact, the statute saying, that there shall be given to the
prisoner"the name, profession and place of abode of the jurors and
witnesses"in the case.  FROST-1840-1,188.928

The second objection is, that this is a bad description, on the ground
of its being too general.  FROST-1840-1,188.929

In the first place it is to be observed, if the parish of St.
Woollos is larger than the borough of Newport, inasmuch as it is shown
that he lives in that part of the parish of St. Woollos which is
in the borough of Newport, you may reject altogether that part of the
parish that is out of the <P_189> borough; FROST-1840-1,189.930

and, therefore, the only question is whether the description
of a man living in the borough of Newport is sufficient or not.
FROST-1840-1,189.931

It is observable, that the statute which first gives to the prisoner the
advantage of having the names of the witnesses, and their professions
and places of abode, couples in the same words the name, profession and
place of abode of the witnesses and jurors.  FROST-1840-1,189.932

Now, upon looking at the panel of the jury, I find that every juror is
returned, not as of a particular street, but generally, of the town or
parish where his abode is.  FROST-1840-1,189.933

For instance,"Avery, of Monmouth, gentleman; Andrews, of Abergavenny,
ironmonger; Ball, of Chepstow, victualler;"and so on throughout;
none, indeed, being from Newport, because the sheriff, for a very
obvious reason, thought it better not to summon any from that place;
FROST-1840-1,189.934

and it seems to me, that if we should say that this was a void description
of the witness on the ground of uncertainty, we must equally say so with
respect to every juryman summoned.  FROST-1840-1,189.935

They stand in the same predicament.  FROST-1840-1,189.936

On these grounds, I think, that both the objections which have been
raised must be overruled.  FROST-1840-1,189.937

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> I am of the same opinion with
my Lord Chief Justice upon both these points.  FROST-1840-1,189.938

With respect to misdescription, that appears to me to be entirely out
of the question.  FROST-1840-1,189.939

The description of the place of abode of the witness is perfectly accurate
; FROST-1840-1,189.940

he does live in the parish of St. Woollos, FROST-1840-1,189.941

and he does live in the borough of Newport, FROST-1840-1,189.942

and there is nothing like an allegation that the whole of the parish is
in the borough.  FROST-1840-1,189.943

And as to the sufficiency of the description, it appears to me to be
enough, especially in analogy to the case cited by the Attorney-general,
where the town is described as the place of abode.  FROST-1840-1,189.944

Mr. Justice <font> Williams.  <$$font> I should have thought that
this was a more favourable description of the witness than if the parish
were given generally.  FROST-1840-1,189.945

If it were"the parish of St. Woollos,"that would comprehend a
larger surface; FROST-1840-1,189.946

but it is merely that part of the parish which is in the borough of
Newport; FROST-1840-1,189.947

and, consequently, that limits and confines the inquiry to a smaller
space than if the parish had been given generally.  FROST-1840-1,189.948

With regard to the other point, the sufficiency of the description,
I observed that much inquiry was made of the witness as to whether the
lot of houses there had any definite name.  FROST-1840-1,189.949

If it had appeared that that lot of 10 or 12 houses had acquired a
definite and definitive name, by possibility there might be some ground
for contending that this was too general a description, because more
might have been given; FROST-1840-1,189.950

but nothing of that sort is applicable to this case.  FROST-1840-1,189.951

It appears that this is the course constantly pursued with regard to
those returned by the sheriff to serve upon the jury, FROST-1840-1,189.952

and I am of opinion, that it is a sufficient description;
FROST-1840-1,189.953

certainly it is no mis-description.  FROST-1840-1,189.954

Is this plan, entitled"Plan of the canals and railroads communicating

FROST-1840-1,190.989

- The original was made by me; FROST-1840-1,190.990

that is a lithographic copy.  FROST-1840-1,190.991

- I believe it to be accurate.  FROST-1840-1,190.997

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> It would be much better, if it
is proposed to put in the map of the county, by mutual consent to put

but accompanied by an immense body of men in the road.
FROST-1840-1,191.1032

You say Mr. Frost was on the pavement?  FROST-1840-1,191.1033

- On the pavement.  FROST-1840-1,191.1034

On the pavement near what spot; FROST-1840-1,191.1035

how near to the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,191.1036

- I should think, perhaps, within two or three feet, or a yard.
FROST-1840-1,191.1037

On the pavement by the house?  FROST-1840-1,191.1038

- Close by the house.  FROST-1840-1,191.1039

In front of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,191.1040

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,191.1041

You say accompanied by an immense number of persons; FROST-1840-1,191.1042

where were those persons?  FROST-1840-1,191.1043

- Occupying the whole of the roadway.  FROST-1840-1,191.1044

Had you known Mr. Frost before?  FROST-1840-1,191.1045

- I had known him from infancy.  FROST-1840-1,191.1046

Did you observe the dress that he had on on that morning?
FROST-1840-1,191.1047

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,191.1048

Describe it; FROST-1840-1,191.1049

did you observe any neck-handkerchief?  FROST-1840-1,191.1050

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,191.1051

Describe it?  FROST-1840-1,191.1052

- It appeared to be a sort of loose wrapper, a red handkerchief.
FROST-1840-1,191.1053

Have you ever heard that description of handkerchief called by any name?
FROST-1840-1,191.1054

- Yes; I have heard them called by several names, FROST-1840-1,191.1055

a weather handkerchief, they call them; one that would be likely to be
worn over another.  FROST-1840-1,191.1056

Did you hear any firing?  FROST-1840-1,191.1057

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-1,191.1058

Where was Mr. Frost when you first heard that firing?
FROST-1840-1,191.1059

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,191.1060

How near to the time when the firing began had you seen Mr. Frost?
FROST-1840-1,191.1061

- Almost instantaneously after I had seen Mr. Frost, I heard
the firing.  FROST-1840-1,191.1062

Where were you; FROST-1840-1,191.1063

were you on duty as a special constable that morning?
FROST-1840-1,191.1064

- Not on any specific duty, further than that I had to keep watch.
FROST-1840-1,191.1065

Were you there to keep the peace as a special constable?
FROST-1840-1,191.1066

- Certainly.  FROST-1840-1,191.1067

<P_192>

Where were you standing at the time that you saw Mr. Frost on
the pavement in front of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,192.1069

- In the commercial room of the Westgate.  FROST-1840-1,192.1070

You were in the inn, in the commercial room?  FROST-1840-1,192.1071

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,192.1072

The house, we understand, has two bows?  FROST-1840-1,192.1073

- It has, one at each extremity.  FROST-1840-1,192.1074

And a centre?  FROST-1840-1,192.1075

- And a centre.  FROST-1840-1,192.1076

What part of the room were you in?  FROST-1840-1,192.1077

- I should imagine it is the west end; FROST-1840-1,192.1078

it is the end immediately fronting the portico of the mayor's house.
FROST-1840-1,192.1079

Is that the corner of the Westgate Inn, as you come down Stowe-hill?
FROST-1840-1,192.1080

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,192.1081

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> The commercial room is a
bow-window room?  FROST-1840-1,192.1082

- It is, my Lord.  FROST-1840-1,192.1083

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> The bow-window near the
Stowe-hill, as you come round?  FROST-1840-1,192.1084

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,192.1085

Were you alone in that room, FROST-1840-1,192.1086

or what description of persons were with you?  FROST-1840-1,192.1087

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} speak to my own knowledge of more than one
being in the room; FROST-1840-1,192.1088

but I believe there were one or two besides.  FROST-1840-1,192.1089

At what time had you gone out with a view of keeping the peace, in this
place, as special constable?  FROST-1840-1,192.1090

- I had returned to Newport about 11 o'clock the previous night,
FROST-1840-1,192.1091

and on my arrival there I heard - FROST-1840-1,192.1092

Never mind what you heard.  FROST-1840-1,192.1093

- The special constables were being sworn in, FROST-1840-1,192.1094

and I went up to the Westgate, to offer my service.  FROST-1840-1,192.1095

Did you remain out all night?  FROST-1840-1,192.1096

- I did; that is, I remained from home all night.  FROST-1840-1,192.1097

Did you remain out, with a view to keep the peace of the town, all night?
FROST-1840-1,192.1098

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,192.1099

Were you during the night at one place, or at different parts of the town?
FROST-1840-1,192.1100

- At different parts of the town.  FROST-1840-1,192.1101

How early in the morning had you first gone to the Westgate Inn?
FROST-1840-1,192.1102

- I had visited the Westgate in the middle of the night.
FROST-1840-1,192.1103

How long had you been at the Westgate Inn that morning, before you saw
Mr. Frost, as you have stated?  FROST-1840-1,192.1104

- I should imagine about 20 minutes; FROST-1840-1,192.1105

I have no particular data.  FROST-1840-1,192.1106

That is near enough.  FROST-1840-1,192.1107

Had you seen this company of persons, as you describe them, before you
saw them in front of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,192.1108

- Decidedly not.  FROST-1840-1,192.1109

You did not see, then, from what direction they came?
FROST-1840-1,192.1110

- Down Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,192.1111

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Did you see that?
FROST-1840-1,192.1112

- I saw that.  FROST-1840-1,192.1113

Through the bow-window?  FROST-1840-1,192.1114

- Through the bow-window.  FROST-1840-1,192.1115

It should be stated, that the shutters of the window when I went <P_193>
into the room were closed, FROST-1840-1,193.1116

and it was mere curiosity, in fact, that induced me to go to the
commercial-room; FROST-1840-1,193.1117

and I opened one of the ledges of the window, when, upon doing
so, I saw this immense multitude of people coming down the hill.
FROST-1840-1,193.1118

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> And when they came down the
hill, in what direction did they go to the front?  FROST-1840-1,193.1119

- They immediately wheeled round.  FROST-1840-1,193.1120

How long did you remain in the commercial-room after you saw them through
the window?  FROST-1840-1,193.1121

- A very few seconds.  FROST-1840-1,193.1122

Where did you go then?  FROST-1840-1,193.1123

- I remained in the room as long as I considered it was safe remaining
there; FROST-1840-1,193.1124

and on leaving the room and going into the passage, where I might have
got into the back-yard, I found that the only door through which I could
have gone was blockaded.  FROST-1840-1,193.1125

Blockaded by whom?  FROST-1840-1,193.1126

- By the same men.  FROST-1840-1,193.1127

You found the back door blockaded by a part of these men?
FROST-1840-1,193.1128

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,193.1129

What did you do, FROST-1840-1,193.1130

or where did you go, when you found that door blockaded?
FROST-1840-1,193.1131

- I had but one place to go to, FROST-1840-1,193.1132

and that was up stairs.  FROST-1840-1,193.1133

Did you go up stairs?  FROST-1840-1,193.1134

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,193.1135

Where were you when you saw Mr. Frost on the pavement as you
have described?  FROST-1840-1,193.1136

- In the commercial-room, previous to my leaving it.
FROST-1840-1,193.1137

Does any part of the window look across the front of the Westgate Inn?
FROST-1840-1,193.1138

- It does, a portion of the bow-window.  FROST-1840-1,193.1139

There is a window that looks across the front, FROST-1840-1,193.1140

is that towards Commercial-street?  FROST-1840-1,193.1141

- I rather think they term it Westgate-street; FROST-1840-1,193.1142

if I had the plan I could explain.  FROST-1840-1,193.1143

<bracket> <font> The plan was handed to the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,193.1144

It is Westgate-street.  FROST-1840-1,193.1145

Is the street immediately in front of the Westgate called Westgate-street
?  FROST-1840-1,193.1146

- I believe it is.  FROST-1840-1,193.1147

Is that a continuation of the lane, part of which is called
Commercial-street?  FROST-1840-1,193.1148

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,193.1149

And does that lane continue to the High-street?  FROST-1840-1,193.1150

- It does.  FROST-1840-1,193.1151

Inclining to the right?  FROST-1840-1,193.1152

- Inclining to the right.  FROST-1840-1,193.1153

How soon after you saw this company of persons coming down Stowe-hill,
you being in the commercial-room, did you hear the firing, as near as
you can speak?  FROST-1840-1,193.1154

- The time was very short - FROST-1840-1,193.1155

it is hardly calculable FROST-1840-1,193.1156

- I should say immediately; FROST-1840-1,193.1157

when I say firing, really the noise and din of breaking in the windows
in the room where I was was so great, that although firing actually
occurred, I could not distinctly swear that I heard any firing at all.
FROST-1840-1,193.1158

Did you see any smoke?  FROST-1840-1,193.1159

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,193.1160

You say there was a noise of breaking in the windows of the
commercial-room?  FROST-1840-1,193.1161

- I do.  FROST-1840-1,193.1162

<P_194>

Did that take place before or after you left the commercial-room?
FROST-1840-1,194.1164

- Before.  FROST-1840-1,194.1165

Who were the persons that were breaking in those windows?
FROST-1840-1,194.1166

- The men that I had immediately before seen coming down the hill.
FROST-1840-1,194.1167

In what manner were they breaking in the windows?  FROST-1840-1,194.1168

- With various sorts of weapons.  FROST-1840-1,194.1169

Just describe them - FROST-1840-1,194.1170

pikes?  FROST-1840-1,194.1171

- Pikes and mandrils.  FROST-1840-1,194.1172

Is a mandril an instrument something like a pick-axe?
FROST-1840-1,194.1173

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,194.1174

Are the points like those of ordinary pick-axes?  FROST-1840-1,194.1175

- Yes; a point and a broad edge; FROST-1840-1,194.1176

there were various sorts of weapons, FROST-1840-1,194.1177

I can hardly describe them, they were so varied.  FROST-1840-1,194.1178

You said that you remained in the commercial-room as long as you thought
it safe, FROST-1840-1,194.1179

did you quit it before those persons began to break in the windows,
or after?  FROST-1840-1,194.1180

- After.  FROST-1840-1,194.1181

Then you went up stairs; FROST-1840-1,194.1182

how long did you remain up stairs?  FROST-1840-1,194.1183

- During the whole of the firing.  FROST-1840-1,194.1184

How many minutes, or what portion of time do you give to that?
FROST-1840-1,194.1185

- I have always supposed that it lasted about six or seven minutes;
FROST-1840-1,194.1186

I calculate that.  FROST-1840-1,194.1187

I think you said you could not distinctly swear that you heard firing?
FROST-1840-1,194.1188

- I should be sorry to say positively.  FROST-1840-1,194.1189

Does that apply to the whole time, or to any part of the time?
FROST-1840-1,194.1190

- During the time of breaking in the windows.  FROST-1840-1,194.1191

When you got up stairs, are you enabled to say whether there was firing
or not?  FROST-1840-1,194.1192

- Oh dear, yes, some hundred volleys, I should think.
FROST-1840-1,194.1193

Are you enabled to say, from your own observation, whether the firing came
from the persons you saw coming round in the manner you have described?
FROST-1840-1,194.1194

- I have no doubt that the firing came from them, FROST-1840-1,194.1195

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say so of my own personal observation.
FROST-1840-1,194.1196

Did you see any guns?  FROST-1840-1,194.1197

- I did, in the crowd.  FROST-1840-1,194.1198

Were you enabled to see, in going up stairs, whether those guns were
discharged, or any of them?  FROST-1840-1,194.1199

- I was not in front of the house, FROST-1840-1,194.1200

and therefore could not see them.  FROST-1840-1,194.1201

While up stairs did you hear firing?  FROST-1840-1,194.1202

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,194.1203

For about seven minutes?  FROST-1840-1,194.1204

- I should imagine about seven minutes.  FROST-1840-1,194.1205

I think you say while up stairs you were not in front of the house?
FROST-1840-1,194.1206

- I was in one of the back bed-rooms.  FROST-1840-1,194.1207

What number of persons did you find in the passage when the door was
blockaded as you have described?  FROST-1840-1,194.1208

- That portion of the passage was quite full between the door and the
room in which the soldiers were, and between that and the entrance to
the house.  FROST-1840-1,194.1209

Is the entrance to the house in the middle of the house?
FROST-1840-1,194.1210

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,194.1211

<P_195>

Suppose you enter from the front of the house, FROST-1840-1,195.1213

if you turn to the right, does that lead to the commercial-room?
FROST-1840-1,195.1214

- It does.  FROST-1840-1,195.1215

If you turn to the left, where does that lead to?  FROST-1840-1,195.1216

- It leads into the room where the soldiers were.  FROST-1840-1,195.1217

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Down stairs?
FROST-1840-1,195.1218

- Down stairs, my Lord.  FROST-1840-1,195.1219

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> The house has two bows?
FROST-1840-1,195.1220

- It has.  FROST-1840-1,195.1221

That room is one of the bow-windowed rooms, FROST-1840-1,195.1222

and is the room in which the soldiers were?  FROST-1840-1,195.1223

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,195.1224

Is that the corresponding end of the house to the commercial-room at
the other end?  FROST-1840-1,195.1225

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,195.1226

And, you say, the space from the door to the room where the soldiers
were was full of men?  FROST-1840-1,195.1227

- From the entrance-hall to the room where the soldiers were, as far
as I could see of the passage, it appeared to be quite full of men.
FROST-1840-1,195.1228

Did you see whether those men had arms of any description?
FROST-1840-1,195.1229

- They had.  FROST-1840-1,195.1230

What had they?  FROST-1840-1,195.1231

- I distinctly saw one person with a weapon something like a pike
I should imagine, deliberately breaking the windows of the bar,
FROST-1840-1,195.1232

he was the nearest to me; FROST-1840-1,195.1233

as to the weapons of the others, the time was so short, that I should
be sorry to say what they were.  FROST-1840-1,195.1234

You say you stood in the commercial-room as long as you thought it safe
; FROST-1840-1,195.1235

did you go immediately from that room up stairs?  FROST-1840-1,195.1236

- I did, inasmuch as there was no egress to the back yard, the door
being blockaded, as I have described.  FROST-1840-1,195.1237

How soon did you quit that back room into which you went up stairs?
FROST-1840-1,195.1238

- After I heard the firing cease.  FROST-1840-1,195.1239

Did you come down stairs?  FROST-1840-1,195.1240

- - I did.  FROST-1840-1,195.1241

Did you find any dead bodies?  FROST-1840-1,195.1242

- I saw several in the house, dead and dying.  FROST-1840-1,195.1243

Had you seen any of those persons before you went up, dead or alive?
FROST-1840-1,195.1244

- Not an individual, that I am aware of.  FROST-1840-1,195.1245

Then, they met their death while you were up stairs?
FROST-1840-1,195.1246

- Exactly.  FROST-1840-1,195.1247

Had you an opportunity of seeing whether there were any dead or dying
persons outside the door?  FROST-1840-1,195.1248

- I had.  FROST-1840-1,195.1249

Were there any?  FROST-1840-1,195.1250

- There were.  FROST-1840-1,195.1251

How many?  FROST-1840-1,195.1252

- Four; three dead and one dying.  FROST-1840-1,195.1253

When you came out, what was the state of that company of persons that
you had seen in front; FROST-1840-1,195.1254

were they there in the same number, or less, FROST-1840-1,195.1255

or were they all gone?  FROST-1840-1,195.1256

- They were dispersed.  FROST-1840-1,195.1257

Entirely?  FROST-1840-1,195.1258

- No, I should say not entirely: FROST-1840-1,195.1259

they were hanging on the skirts and corners of the streets.
FROST-1840-1,195.1260

At the time you saw Mr. Frost where you have described, was there
any person near you, that you spoke to - FROST-1840-1,195.1261

I do not ask what you said?  FROST-1840-1,195.1262

- There was.  FROST-1840-1,195.1263

<P_196>

What was his name?  FROST-1840-1,196.1265

- Thomas Latch.  FROST-1840-1,196.1266

How soon was the assemblage entirely dispersed - FROST-1840-1,196.1267

I do not ask to minutes - FROST-1840-1,196.1268

was it half an hour, or an hour?  FROST-1840-1,196.1269

- When I came from up stairs to the front of the house the parties had
dispersed, FROST-1840-1,196.1270

and the square, the immediate front of the Westgate, was vacant;
FROST-1840-1,196.1271

it was completely empty.  FROST-1840-1,196.1272

Had you seen the soldiers go into the room where you have described them
as being?  FROST-1840-1,196.1273

- I came from the barracks with them.  FROST-1840-1,196.1274

Can you tell me the number of soldiers?  FROST-1840-1,196.1275

- About 30.  FROST-1840-1,196.1276

And they had gone into that room?  FROST-1840-1,196.1277

- They had.  FROST-1840-1,196.1278

How long had they been there before this transaction occurred that you
have spoken of?  FROST-1840-1,196.1279

- About the same time that I had been; FROST-1840-1,196.1280

I came down with them.  FROST-1840-1,196.1281

Did you say what time - FROST-1840-1,196.1282

about what time had you been with the soldiers before this assemblage
arrived?  FROST-1840-1,196.1283

- Well, I should imagine about 20 minutes.  FROST-1840-1,196.1284

Can you tell me whether the shutters of that room were open, so that
the soldiers could be seen in the room, or whether they were closed?
FROST-1840-1,196.1285

- I believe they were closed.  FROST-1840-1,196.1286

Did you look?  FROST-1840-1,196.1287

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} swear to that, of my own knowledge.
FROST-1840-1,196.1288

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Sir F. Pollock.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-1,196.1290

<$$heading>

You say you have known Mr. Frost all your life-time, from your
infancy?  FROST-1840-1,196.1292

- From my infancy, I have.  FROST-1840-1,196.1293

Of course, then, I presume, you have yourself lived at Newport all
your life?  FROST-1840-1,196.1294

- No, I have not.  FROST-1840-1,196.1295

More or less?  FROST-1840-1,196.1296

- More or less, I have lived in Newport and its immediate neighbourhood.
FROST-1840-1,196.1297

You have known the place ever since you were born?  FROST-1840-1,196.1298

- I have been in the constant habit of visiting the place.
FROST-1840-1,196.1299

How long have you been in practice as an attorney?  FROST-1840-1,196.1300

- Three years.  FROST-1840-1,196.1301

I dare say you know that Mr. Frost was mayor of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,196.1302

- I do.  FROST-1840-1,196.1303

Perhaps more than once?  FROST-1840-1,196.1304

- I am not aware that he was mayor more than once.  FROST-1840-1,196.1305

In what year was he mayor?  FROST-1840-1,196.1306

- I should think it must have been in 1836; FROST-1840-1,196.1307

I fancy so.  FROST-1840-1,196.1308

I dare say you personally know that he was a magistrate?
FROST-1840-1,196.1309

- I know it personally.  FROST-1840-1,196.1310

Do you know how long he was a magistrate - several years?
FROST-1840-1,196.1311

- He was a magistrate, I believe, for three or four years.
FROST-1840-1,196.1312

That would be several?  FROST-1840-1,196.1313

- Exactly.  FROST-1840-1,196.1314

A very active magistrate, was he not?  FROST-1840-1,196.1315

- I believe so.  FROST-1840-1,196.1316

If you do know it, I would ask you whether he was not a <P_197> very
active and conscientious magistrate?  FROST-1840-1,197.1317

- For any thing that I know to the contrary.  FROST-1840-1,197.1318

You say you went to the room up stairs?  FROST-1840-1,197.1319

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,197.1320

That was at the back of the house?  FROST-1840-1,197.1321

- It was.  FROST-1840-1,197.1322

You did not see any thing of what took place after you got there?
FROST-1840-1,197.1323

- Certainly not.  FROST-1840-1,197.1324

Now, you say that you came down with some soldiers about 20 minutes
before?  FROST-1840-1,197.1325

- I came down with them; FROST-1840-1,197.1326

I really $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell the exact time,
FROST-1840-1,197.1327

I have no means of calculating it; FROST-1840-1,197.1328

it might have been 20 minutes, FROST-1840-1,197.1329

or it might have been half an hour.  FROST-1840-1,197.1330

Do not understand me as pressing you upon the subject;
FROST-1840-1,197.1331

I ask you whether it was 20 minutes or half an hour?
FROST-1840-1,197.1332

- A very short time had elapsed.  FROST-1840-1,197.1333

Where did you go to fetch them?  FROST-1840-1,197.1334

- I did not go to fetch them; FROST-1840-1,197.1335

I happened to be there at the time when information came that they were
to go down.  FROST-1840-1,197.1336

You say you had come down with the soldiers; FROST-1840-1,197.1337

where did you meet them?  FROST-1840-1,197.1338

- At the barracks; FROST-1840-1,197.1339

I happened to be at the barracks when they were ordered to go down.
FROST-1840-1,197.1340

That is an answer; FROST-1840-1,197.1341

do you see at that distance enough to tell me whether that is the barracks
, the union poor-house?  FROST-1840-1,197.1342

- <bracket> <font> Pointing out the same upon the plan.  <$$font>
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,197.1343

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,197.1344

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> Just mark a small dot at
that spot.  FROST-1840-1,197.1345

<bracket> <font> The witness marked the plan.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,197.1346

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> This is the union
poor-house, which was used as barracks?  FROST-1840-1,197.1347

- A portion of which was used as barracks.  FROST-1840-1,197.1348

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Were there any persons that
Sunday night in custody at the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,197.1349

- There were, though I did not see them in custody myself.
FROST-1840-1,197.1350

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Which night?
FROST-1840-1,197.1351

- The Sunday night, my Lord.  FROST-1840-1,197.1352

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Between the Sunday and Monday?
FROST-1840-1,197.1353

- Between the Sunday and Monday, my Lord.  FROST-1840-1,197.1354

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> You say you did not see them?
FROST-1840-1,197.1355

- I did not see them.  FROST-1840-1,197.1356

You mean, you did not see them in custody?  FROST-1840-1,197.1357

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,197.1358

Did you see any of them come there?  FROST-1840-1,197.1359

- No.  FROST-1840-1,197.1360

How do you know they were there?  FROST-1840-1,197.1361

- I merely tell you, from hearing it at the time, that parties had been
taken to the Westgate; FROST-1840-1,197.1362

I had no curiosity to see them myself.  FROST-1840-1,197.1363

Was there any part of the Westgate Inn that was appropriated to the
reception of persons in custody?  FROST-1840-1,197.1364

- There was.  FROST-1840-1,197.1365

Whereabouts was that?  FROST-1840-1,197.1366

- Between the entrance-hall and the room where the soldiers were stationed
, on the left-hand side as you enter.  FROST-1840-1,197.1367

A small room, between the bow window and the door?  FROST-1840-1,197.1368

- Exactly.  FROST-1840-1,197.1369

<P_198>

And in front?  FROST-1840-1,198.1371

- In front; FROST-1840-1,198.1372

that is the answer to the question as to whether a certain portion of
the house was allotted to prisoners; FROST-1840-1,198.1373

I do not mean to say that it was on Sunday night, because that I $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} speak to; FROST-1840-1,198.1374

but on Monday night it was.  FROST-1840-1,198.1375

You say there were persons in custody on Sunday night;
FROST-1840-1,198.1376

where were they?  FROST-1840-1,198.1377

- I say, that I do not of my own knowledge know that they were in custody,
FROST-1840-1,198.1378

but I know it to be so, inasmuch as it was the current report of the town.
FROST-1840-1,198.1379

How early in the evening did you hear it?  FROST-1840-1,198.1380

- I should imagine about 12 o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,198.1381

In the day?  FROST-1840-1,198.1382

- No, in the night.  FROST-1840-1,198.1383

Did you yourself assist in taking any body there?  FROST-1840-1,198.1384

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,198.1385

Nor see any body else assist?  FROST-1840-1,198.1386

- I did not.  FROST-1840-1,198.1387

Do you know on that Sunday night in what part of the house those
persons were?  FROST-1840-1,198.1388

- No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say, except that that room was allotted
for the purpose on the Monday.  FROST-1840-1,198.1389

Did you then know it?  FROST-1840-1,198.1390

- I did know it.  FROST-1840-1,198.1391

Though you did not see any person in custody on Sunday night, you
might know that there was a room appropriated for persons in custody?
FROST-1840-1,198.1392

- I believe there were persons in custody on that Sunday night.
FROST-1840-1,198.1393

You heard it about 12 o'clock?  FROST-1840-1,198.1394

- It was the middle of the night.  FROST-1840-1,198.1395

It was the current report all night, long before the main body came to
the town, that they were taking them up one by one.  FROST-1840-1,198.1396

Had you not instructions to take persons up, as a special constable?
FROST-1840-1,198.1397

- My general instructions were such; FROST-1840-1,198.1398

but I had no instructions that night.  FROST-1840-1,198.1399

What were your general instructions?  FROST-1840-1,198.1400

- Merely to perform the duties of special constable; nothing more
than that.  FROST-1840-1,198.1401

Had you any directions to arrest any persons?  FROST-1840-1,198.1402

- I had not.  FROST-1840-1,198.1403

Were there no directions to you, that if any persons were found
straggling, they should be arrested?  FROST-1840-1,198.1404

- No, I did not come into the town till 12 o'clock that night,
when most of the special constables had received their orders.
FROST-1840-1,198.1405

Do you know a person of the name of Vincent, of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,198.1406

- I know him by common report, and from having seen him latterly;
FROST-1840-1,198.1407

I know him, also, personally.  FROST-1840-1,198.1408

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He had no personal
acquaintance, FROST-1840-1,198.1409

but he knows him by sight.  FROST-1840-1,198.1410

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> He was a shopkeeper in the town?
FROST-1840-1,198.1411

- Not that I am aware of.  FROST-1840-1,198.1412

Do you know any thing about him?  FROST-1840-1,198.1413

- Nothing more than that he made several public speeches in Newport;
and also purported to be an author and publisher.  FROST-1840-1,198.1414

Were they public speeches made at public meetings?  FROST-1840-1,198.1415

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,198.1416

<P_199>

Do you know that he was in custody at that time in Monmouth?
FROST-1840-1,199.1418

- I do.  FROST-1840-1,199.1419

On the Sunday night did you know that Vincent was in custody?
FROST-1840-1,199.1420

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,199.1421

I believe here, at Monmouth?  FROST-1840-1,199.1422

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,199.1423

Do you know, yourself, whether there had been any applications made
to the magistrates upon the subject of Vincent, and his mode of being
treated in the gaol?  FROST-1840-1,199.1424

- Of my own knowledge, I do not; FROST-1840-1,199.1425

further than that I have seen letters, I believe, signed by Mr.
Frost himself, in which he states - FROST-1840-1,199.1426

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> No, stop.
FROST-1840-1,199.1427

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I do not ask the contents of
the letters written by Mr. Frost; FROST-1840-1,199.1428

but I want to know whether there had not been a general talk in Newport
of Vincent being in custody, and the mode in which he was treated?
FROST-1840-1,199.1429

- No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that I then knew any thing of that.
FROST-1840-1,199.1430

You say that you did not know that that was the subject of any general
conversation?  FROST-1840-1,199.1431

- I had learned that men of the same political opinions as himself were
- FROST-1840-1,199.1432

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> My Lord, I must object ;
FROST-1840-1,199.1433

we shall get very wide of the question by asking the witness what
he heard.  FROST-1840-1,199.1434

He is now going to state something about political opinions, which will
lead to a very distracted inquiry.  FROST-1840-1,199.1435

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, I apprehend I
have a perfect right to ascertain whether such a report existed.
FROST-1840-1,199.1436

I am not proposing to prove the fact, that that report was well founded
; FROST-1840-1,199.1437

but I am proposing to prove that there were, as a matter of notoriety,
general complaints, no matter by whom, of the treatment of a person of
the name of Vincent.  FROST-1840-1,199.1438

Surely, my Lord, I have a right to do that.  FROST-1840-1,199.1439

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> To what period are you
referring?  FROST-1840-1,199.1440

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, I am referring to the
time previous to the period in question.  FROST-1840-1,199.1441

I will not disguise from your Lordship my object - FROST-1840-1,199.1442

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> No, we do not want you to
tell your object.  FROST-1840-1,199.1443

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I doubt, my Lord, whether I am
under any obligation to do that; FROST-1840-1,199.1444

but your Lordship knows that the state of the country, the prevailing
public reports, and the general feeling of the public mind, are taken
to be evidence.  FROST-1840-1,199.1445

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> I did not object
to the question, whether there was any general talk in the town;
FROST-1840-1,199.1446

but having said there was not, then he is asked,"did you hear" so and so.
FROST-1840-1,199.1447

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The note I have taken is
this: FROST-1840-1,199.1448

"I did not know of a general talk of Vincent, and the mode of treating
him. "FROST-1840-1,199.1449

<font> Witness.  <$$font> That is the answer I would give.
FROST-1840-1,199.1450

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Though you do not know of
general talk, do <P_200> you know of talk among persons of certain
political opinions?  FROST-1840-1,200.1451

- I am not in any way likely to hear.  FROST-1840-1,200.1452

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> You need not excuse your
want of knowledge, FROST-1840-1,200.1453

but state the fact.  FROST-1840-1,200.1454

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Do not you know that
letters appeared in the newspapers upon the subject.  {COM:sic}
FROST-1840-1,200.1455

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> That surely $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be proved?  FROST-1840-1,200.1456

- I have expressly stated my knowledge to that effect.
FROST-1840-1,200.1457

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> You stated"letters from Mr.
Frost? "FROST-1840-1,200.1458

- Letters, published letters; FROST-1840-1,200.1459

I had no other means of obtaining information.  FROST-1840-1,200.1460

Now, I ask, was not the mode in which Vincent was supposed to be treated
matter of public discussion in the newspapers?  FROST-1840-1,200.1461

- Not to my knowledge.  FROST-1840-1,200.1462

Or complaint in the newspapers?  FROST-1840-1,200.1463

- Yes, I have heard.  FROST-1840-1,200.1464

Have you not seen?  FROST-1840-1,200.1465

- I really $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fix my memory to the fact, whether
I have seen many complaints; FROST-1840-1,200.1466

I believe I have seen correspondence by Mr. Frost to the effect
referred to by you; but nothing more, to the best of my knowledge;
FROST-1840-1,200.1467

I never read them.  FROST-1840-1,200.1468

I thought you had stated that you had read them?  FROST-1840-1,200.1469

- I have seen them, and gathered their purport.  FROST-1840-1,200.1470

How have you gathered their purport without reading them?
FROST-1840-1,200.1471

- I could gather the purport without reading the correspondence;
FROST-1840-1,200.1472

it was a subject I had no interest in.  FROST-1840-1,200.1473

Do you know how long before that Mr. Vincent had been in custody?
FROST-1840-1,200.1474

- Some months.  FROST-1840-1,200.1475

Mr. Justice <font> Williams.  <$$font> Before the night in
question?  FROST-1840-1,200.1476

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Before the night in question?
FROST-1840-1,200.1477

- At the last March assizes, I believe.  FROST-1840-1,200.1478

You are not a magistrate yourself, or magistrate's clerk,
FROST-1840-1,200.1479

and had nothing to do with the prosecution?  FROST-1840-1,200.1480

- I am not $a {TEXT:missing_"a"} magistrate's clerk, FROST-1840-1,200.1481

nor have I had any thing to do with the prosecution in any way.
FROST-1840-1,200.1482

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> There is one question, my Lord,
I wish to put.  FROST-1840-1,200.1483

<bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> You have said
that you saw Mr. Frost in front of the commercial-room at the
Westgate; FROST-1840-1,200.1484

did the firing and noise take place immediately after you saw Frost?
FROST-1840-1,200.1485

- It is in evidence that I say so.  FROST-1840-1,200.1486

<heading>

and made my escape.  FROST-1840-1,201.1554

Did you see any persons in the house as you went from the commercial-room

Or in the night at all?  FROST-1840-1,202.1607

I do not know what that is?  FROST-1840-1,202.1613

FROST-1840-1,202.1614

<P_203>

Only to chapel?  FROST-1840-1,203.1616

- Only to chapel in the morning; FROST-1840-1,203.1617

I was out in the evening.  FROST-1840-1,203.1618

before this Monday, that some persons had been taken, and were in custody
at the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,203.1619

- I should think I was there 10 minutes.  FROST-1840-1,203.1622

FROST-1840-1,203.1623

- Yes; I did not know that any were in custody at the Westgate,
FROST-1840-1,203.1624

but I knew that some had been taken during the night.
FROST-1840-1,203.1625

Were you at all in the little room between the entrance and the room in
which the soldiers were?  FROST-1840-1,203.1626

- No, I was not.  FROST-1840-1,203.1627

Now, I think you say that you saw Mr. Frost pass under the window?
FROST-1840-1,203.1628

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,203.1629

That is the bow-window of the commercial-room?  FROST-1840-1,203.1630

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,203.1631

Was Mr. Waters, the last witness, with you at that time?
FROST-1840-1,203.1632

- Yes, he was.  FROST-1840-1,203.1633

I do not ask you what passed; FROST-1840-1,203.1634

but did any thing pass between you and him at the moment?
FROST-1840-1,203.1635

- I said - FROST-1840-1,203.1636

I am asking, did any thing pass; FROST-1840-1,203.1637

was a remark made at the time?  FROST-1840-1,203.1638

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,203.1639

And that was the last that you saw of Mr. Frost?
FROST-1840-1,203.1640

- It was the only time I saw him.  FROST-1840-1,203.1641

Was Mr. Waters in such a situation that he saw him too?
FROST-1840-1,203.1642

- He was standing alongside of me at the window.  FROST-1840-1,203.1643

Then he must have seen him too?  FROST-1840-1,203.1644

- I suppose he must.  FROST-1840-1,203.1645

Did you and he together go to the back part of the house?
FROST-1840-1,203.1646

- No.  FROST-1840-1,203.1647

Did you and he leave the room together?  FROST-1840-1,203.1648

- No.  FROST-1840-1,203.1649

Which left it first?  FROST-1840-1,203.1650

- I left the room first.  FROST-1840-1,203.1651

And went out at the back door?  FROST-1840-1,203.1652

- And went out at the back door.  FROST-1840-1,203.1653

We understand there was a bow-window to this room?  FROST-1840-1,203.1654

- Not a bow-window - a projecting kind of window, with three distinct
windows.  FROST-1840-1,203.1655

Did you look out of that window in the direction leading towards
Stowe-hill?  FROST-1840-1,203.1656

- There is a projection of the house that you $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
, standing at that window, see but merely across the road.
FROST-1840-1,203.1657

I was going to ask that very question; FROST-1840-1,203.1658

do you mean to say from that projection that you can see Stowe-hill?
FROST-1840-1,203.1659

- I can see the road leading to Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,203.1660

I am not asking whether you can see the road leading to Stowe-hill,
but whether you can see Stowe-hill?  FROST-1840-1,203.1661

- No.  FROST-1840-1,203.1662

That you are sure about?  FROST-1840-1,203.1663

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,203.1664

Were the shutters of the window closed?  FROST-1840-1,203.1665

- When we first went into the room they were.  FROST-1840-1,203.1666

- Not a body of soldiers; FROST-1840-1,204.1678

I knew that some were billeted there.  FROST-1840-1,204.1679

That would be at every public-house in the kingdom; FROST-1840-1,204.1680

not know?  FROST-1840-1,204.1686

And in fact among them, I suppose they made a good deal of noise, did
not they?  FROST-1840-1,207.1880

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,207.1881

Now you have spoken as to what you tell us Mr. Frost said;

how long did they stop at this spot?  FROST-1840-1,208.1884

You did not join in the hurrahing, did you?  FROST-1840-1,208.1896

How long did you continue to go on before them; FROST-1840-1,208.1898

to what place?  FROST-1840-1,208.1899

- I went across the fields just this side of the machine,
FROST-1840-1,208.1900

and stopped to see which way they would go.  FROST-1840-1,208.1901

You say one party went one way, and the other the other;
FROST-1840-1,208.1902

how far from the machine is it where the roads divide, and where the
party divided?  FROST-1840-1,208.1903

A very little way, then?  FROST-1840-1,208.1905

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,208.1906

If I understand you, one of the roads leads to the Salutation,

and the other road leads to the Friars and the church?
FROST-1840-1,208.1908

Do you mean to swear that they divided there?  FROST-1840-1,208.1910

And that one party went by one road, and the other by the other?
FROST-1840-1,208.1912

How many should you say went by one road, and how many by the other?
FROST-1840-1,208.1914

Did they divide into two equal parts?  FROST-1840-1,208.1916

- About half went one way, the other half the other.

Was it within or outside the door you were placed?  FROST-1840-1,213.2207

- It was in the centre of the door-way.  FROST-1840-1,213.2208

At that time was the door shut or open?  FROST-1840-1,213.2209

- It was open.  FROST-1840-1,213.2210

Were there other special constables placed in the front of the Westgate
besides yourself?  FROST-1840-1,213.2211

- At the door; FROST-1840-1,213.2212

none outside in front, but in the door-way and passage.
FROST-1840-1,213.2213

The door-way being open as you have described?  FROST-1840-1,213.2214

- It was.  FROST-1840-1,213.2215

At that time were there any soldiers in the Westgate?
FROST-1840-1,213.2216

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,213.2217

Do you know of your own knowledge where the soldiers were at the time
you took up your place at the door?  FROST-1840-1,213.2218

- I had seen them march about a quarter of an hour previous into a room
, FROST-1840-1,213.2219

and I had not seen them remove from that room.  FROST-1840-1,213.2220

Was that a room in the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,213.2221

- It was.  FROST-1840-1,213.2222

How long had you remained at your post by the door before you observed
any thing?  FROST-1840-1,213.2223

- I should say about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; not quite
so much.  FROST-1840-1,213.2224

Did you first hear, or did you first see any thing?  FROST-1840-1,213.2225

- First heard.  FROST-1840-1,213.2226

<P_214>

What was it you heard?  FROST-1840-1,214.2228

- Tremendous shouting.  FROST-1840-1,214.2229

Do you know Stowe-hill, in Newport?  FROST-1840-1,214.2230

- I do.  FROST-1840-1,214.2231

In what direction did the shouting appear to you to come?
FROST-1840-1,214.2232

- It came from Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,214.2233

How soon after you had heard the shouting was it before you saw any thing?
FROST-1840-1,214.2234

- Perhaps in the course of a minute, or about a minute.
FROST-1840-1,214.2235

Almost immediately?  FROST-1840-1,214.2236

- Yes, it was almost immediately.  FROST-1840-1,214.2237

What was it that you first saw?  FROST-1840-1,214.2238

- I first saw a few straggling persons come down the hill,
FROST-1840-1,214.2239

and then I saw a tremendous number of men coming round the corner of
Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,214.2240

Was that the turn leading round the corner of Stowe-hill and coming in
front of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,214.2241

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,214.2242

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> A few stragglers?
FROST-1840-1,214.2243

- They were seemingly coming before the mob.  FROST-1840-1,214.2244

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd.  <$$font> In advance of the main
body?  FROST-1840-1,214.2245

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,214.2246

Were the few straggling persons you first saw armed at all?
FROST-1840-1,214.2247

- No; some of them I knew personally; FROST-1840-1,214.2248

they were inhabitants of Newport.  FROST-1840-1,214.2249

After you had seen those straggling persons, what sort of body was it
that you saw wheel round the corner from Stowe-hill and come in front
of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,214.2250

- They were men armed.  FROST-1840-1,214.2251

In what manner were they armed?  FROST-1840-1,214.2252

- Some had guns, FROST-1840-1,214.2253

and some had pikes, and weapons of different descriptions; some made up
roughly, and others tolerably.  FROST-1840-1,214.2254

About how many a-breast did they appear to you to come?
FROST-1840-1,214.2255

- They appeared to come five a-breast.  FROST-1840-1,214.2256

Could you observe whether there was any order in the weapons?
FROST-1840-1,214.2257

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,214.2258

Could you observe that the parties who had particular weapons occupied
particular places in that body?  FROST-1840-1,214.2259

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,214.2260

What was it you observed in that respect?  FROST-1840-1,214.2261

- They seemed to be five a-breast, FROST-1840-1,214.2262

and one man of every other rank had a gun; FROST-1840-1,214.2263

at least a person with a gun marched on the right-hand side of them;
FROST-1840-1,214.2264

that was the near side to the Westgate; FROST-1840-1,214.2265

the others were armed with pikes and those different instruments.
FROST-1840-1,214.2266

So that on the outside of each front rank was a man armed with a gun?
FROST-1840-1,214.2267

- On the inside.  FROST-1840-1,214.2268

On the right-hand leading to the corner?  FROST-1840-1,214.2269

- Yes; FROST-1840-1,214.2270

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say for certain that none of those fives in the
middle had guns, because I could not exactly see.  FROST-1840-1,214.2271

But you could observe that, as far as you saw, those who were on the
right-hand side of every other rank had a gun?  FROST-1840-1,214.2272

- Yes; FROST-1840-1,214.2273

so that there were ten, FROST-1840-1,214.2274

and then there was one man had a gun.  FROST-1840-1,214.2275

Were you at that time standing by the door-post?  FROST-1840-1,214.2276

- I was.  FROST-1840-1,214.2277

In what direction did this body which you have described <P_215> go,
when they first wheeled round the corner?  FROST-1840-1,215.2278

- They went toward the yard gates.  FROST-1840-1,215.2279

Were those gates at that time open or shut?  FROST-1840-1,215.2280

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell.  FROST-1840-1,215.2281

Did you yourself see any attempt made to get in there?
FROST-1840-1,215.2282

- They seemed to go towards it; FROST-1840-1,215.2283

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that they went to the gates then,
because the angle of the house would prevent me from seeing the gates.
FROST-1840-1,215.2284

All that you know is, that they seemed to go there in the first instance?
FROST-1840-1,215.2285

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2286

Do those gates lead into the court at the back part of the house?
FROST-1840-1,215.2287

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2288

Did you see a man named Walters there?  FROST-1840-1,215.2289

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,215.2290

Did you observe what weapon Walters had?  FROST-1840-1,215.2291

- I did observe it.  FROST-1840-1,215.2292

What weapon had he?  FROST-1840-1,215.2293

- A gun.  FROST-1840-1,215.2294

Did you observe him as he passed the window do any thing; make any motion
with the gun?  FROST-1840-1,215.2295

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2296

What did you observe him do?  FROST-1840-1,215.2297

- He held it up in a threatening attitude with one hand, seemingly
pointing to some person in the window, FROST-1840-1,215.2298

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say whether there was any person there.
FROST-1840-1,215.2299

Now after you had seen the crowd go first toward those gates, did you
observe them change their direction?  FROST-1840-1,215.2300

- Yes; at least they stopped; FROST-1840-1,215.2301

they halted in front of the house.  FROST-1840-1,215.2302

Did any of them come to the front door where you were stationed?
FROST-1840-1,215.2303

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2304

Can you at all tell what number it was that came up to the door?
FROST-1840-1,215.2305

- No.  FROST-1840-1,215.2306

How were those armed that came up to the door?  FROST-1840-1,215.2307

- The first was armed with a gun, who came to the door;
FROST-1840-1,215.2308

there were some others who came armed with pikes; FROST-1840-1,215.2309

they did not march up to the door, that is, not in order;
FROST-1840-1,215.2310

they marched there, FROST-1840-1,215.2311

and then they came up to the door, not in order.  FROST-1840-1,215.2312

The door was not wide enough for them to march up to it?
FROST-1840-1,215.2313

- About four feet wide.  FROST-1840-1,215.2314

They marched up in order FROST-1840-1,215.2315

and halted, FROST-1840-1,215.2316

and then a party came not in order to the door, FROST-1840-1,215.2317

and halted?  FROST-1840-1,215.2318

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2319

Did you hear either of the persons who so came up in that manner
towards the passage address any thing to the special constables?
FROST-1840-1,215.2320

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2321

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Was that the man with the gun?
FROST-1840-1,215.2322

- Yes, my Lord.  FROST-1840-1,215.2323

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd.  <$$font> What was it he said to
the special constables?  FROST-1840-1,215.2324

- He said,"Surrender yourselves our prisoners. " FROST-1840-1,215.2325

Did you hear any answer made to that request?  FROST-1840-1,215.2326

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,215.2327

From some one in the passage?  FROST-1840-1,215.2328

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,215.2329

What was it?  FROST-1840-1,215.2330

-"No, never! "FROST-1840-1,215.2331

Upon that did the man with the gun do any thing with it?
FROST-1840-1,215.2332

- He did.  FROST-1840-1,215.2333

<P_216>

What did the man with the gun do?  FROST-1840-1,216.2335

- He levelled it at my head.  FROST-1840-1,216.2336

What did you do upon that?  FROST-1840-1,216.2337

- I caught hold of the door FROST-1840-1,216.2338

and it struck the gun on one side, FROST-1840-1,216.2339

and the gun went off about three inches from my head;
FROST-1840-1,216.2340

it stunned me.  FROST-1840-1,216.2341

Did you hear any firing immediately after that?  FROST-1840-1,216.2342

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,216.2343

Are you enabled to tell from whom that firing proceeded?
FROST-1840-1,216.2344

- It came from the outside the first that I know of.
FROST-1840-1,216.2345

That you are sure of?  FROST-1840-1,216.2346

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,216.2347

After the firing, which you are sure came from the outside, did you hear
any other firing?  FROST-1840-1,216.2348

- I heard firing afterwards; FROST-1840-1,216.2349

it lasted several minutes.  FROST-1840-1,216.2350

What became of you during that firing?  FROST-1840-1,216.2351

- The men, when they rushed into the passage, pushed past me,
FROST-1840-1,216.2352

and the smoke became so great that I could not tell one party from the
other in the passage.  FROST-1840-1,216.2353

The smoke from what?  FROST-1840-1,216.2354

- From the firing; FROST-1840-1,216.2355

I made my way through them; FROST-1840-1,216.2356

I could not tell who they were; FROST-1840-1,216.2357

and went out at the back door of the Westgate into the yard.
FROST-1840-1,216.2358

You say there was a good deal of smoke from the firing in the passage;
FROST-1840-1,216.2359

could you at all form a judgment about how many persons there were
struggling in the passage?  FROST-1840-1,216.2360

- No; it was crowded.  FROST-1840-1,216.2361

Could you tell whether the persons in the passage were armed, generally,
or not?  FROST-1840-1,216.2362

- Yes, the generality of persons were.  FROST-1840-1,216.2363

With what sort of weapons?  FROST-1840-1,216.2364

- Those which had come from the crowd.  FROST-1840-1,216.2365

The same kind of weapons?  FROST-1840-1,216.2366

- Yes, the same kind of weapons.  FROST-1840-1,216.2367

Did the firing continue after you had got into the yard?
FROST-1840-1,216.2368

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,216.2369

How long did you remain in the yard before you returned into the house?
FROST-1840-1,216.2370

- I did not remain there any time; FROST-1840-1,216.2371

I went through the yard, and through the back way of some houses,
FROST-1840-1,216.2372

and went home.  FROST-1840-1,216.2373

You avoided the crowd in front altogether?  FROST-1840-1,216.2374

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,216.2375

Did you return again to the Westgate that morning?  FROST-1840-1,216.2376

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,216.2377

What was the reason you, as a special constable, went away from the
Westgate, and went home?  FROST-1840-1,216.2378

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> If it be a fact, my learned friend
can inquire into the fact, FROST-1840-1,216.2379

but I do not conceive the reason can be evidence.  FROST-1840-1,216.2380

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd.  <$$font> What induced you to
go home?  FROST-1840-1,216.2381

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Stay one moment; FROST-1840-1,216.2382

I must take your Lordships'opinion whether the question can be put in
that form.  FROST-1840-1,216.2383

If the object be to obtain the statement of a fact in answer,
I submit my learned friend is not entitled to put that question.
FROST-1840-1,216.2384

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd.  <$$font> I will not argue about it,
if there is any doubt.  FROST-1840-1,216.2385

<bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> What was the last
thing that <P_217> occurred before you went away?  - Which occurred in
the passage?  FROST-1840-1,217.2386

Yes?  FROST-1840-1,217.2387

- When I went through the passage, the persons were in there who had
come from the crowd.  FROST-1840-1,217.2388

Did you leave them in the state you have described?  FROST-1840-1,217.2389

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,217.2390

How long was it before you visited the Westgate Inn again on that morning?
FROST-1840-1,217.2391

- From 20 to 25 minutes.  FROST-1840-1,217.2392

Did you find any crowd there at that time?  FROST-1840-1,217.2393

- No.  FROST-1840-1,217.2394

They were dispersed?  FROST-1840-1,217.2395

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,217.2396

Did you see any persons lying dead there?  FROST-1840-1,217.2397

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,217.2398

How many?  FROST-1840-1,217.2399

- I saw two in the front of the Westgate, and two at the side.
FROST-1840-1,217.2400

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Mr. Kelly.  <$$font> FROST-1840-1,217.2402

<$$heading>

I presume you know Mr. Frost?  FROST-1840-1,217.2404

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,217.2405

Well?  FROST-1840-1,217.2406

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,217.2407

Have you been on friendly terms with him?  FROST-1840-1,217.2408

- Yes; I had never much intercourse with him.  FROST-1840-1,217.2409

Has your family been on friendly terms with him always?
FROST-1840-1,217.2410

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,217.2411

Do you mean to swear that?  FROST-1840-1,217.2412

- As far as I know.  FROST-1840-1,217.2413

Do you not know that your father has been on bad terms with him?
FROST-1840-1,217.2414

- I do not.  FROST-1840-1,217.2415

You never knew that at all?  FROST-1840-1,217.2416

- No.  FROST-1840-1,217.2417

Is your father here?  FROST-1840-1,217.2418

- He is not; FROST-1840-1,217.2419

I have not seen him in Monmouth; FROST-1840-1,217.2420

I left him on Monday morning.  FROST-1840-1,217.2421

When was it that you were first made a special constable?
FROST-1840-1,217.2422

- I think it was the 11th of May; the 11th or 12th.  FROST-1840-1,217.2423

And have you constantly acted in that character since?
FROST-1840-1,217.2424

- No, not until the riot; FROST-1840-1,217.2425

I was called out on the Sunday night; FROST-1840-1,217.2426

I was first called out then.  FROST-1840-1,217.2427

You were called out on the Sunday night?  FROST-1840-1,217.2428

- I was.  FROST-1840-1,217.2429

As nearly as you can recollect, tell me what time on the Sunday night
you were first called out?  FROST-1840-1,217.2430

- About eight or nine o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,217.2431

In the evening?  FROST-1840-1,217.2432

- In the evening.  FROST-1840-1,217.2433

Do you happen to know whether, at an earlier hour than that, other persons
had been endeavouring to preserve the peace?  FROST-1840-1,217.2434

- No, not of my own knowledge, FROST-1840-1,217.2435

for I had not been outside the house all the day.  FROST-1840-1,217.2436

Did you continue to act during the night?  FROST-1840-1,217.2437

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,217.2438

The whole of the night?  FROST-1840-1,217.2439

- The whole of the night.  FROST-1840-1,217.2440

Perhaps, then, you can tell me whether any persons had been taken
into custody during any part of the day or evening of Sunday?
FROST-1840-1,217.2441

- On Monday morning - at least it was after twelve on <P_218> Sunday
night - there had.  FROST-1840-1,218.2442

I do not know of any being taken before twelve on Sunday night.
FROST-1840-1,218.2443

Only tell me of what you know yourself of your own knowledge.
FROST-1840-1,218.2444

At what time on Monday morning, that is, the night of Sunday, or the
Monday morning, did you know of any person having been taken into custody?
FROST-1840-1,218.2445

- I believe the first to have been the first that I saw, about two or
three o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,218.2446

In the course of the night, or before this riot took place on the
Monday morning, did you see any more that were taken into custody?
FROST-1840-1,218.2447

- Oh, yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2448

Several during the night?  FROST-1840-1,218.2449

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2450

I call it in the night, FROST-1840-1,218.2451

but it was early in the morning?  FROST-1840-1,218.2452

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2453

Several you say after midnight, and before the more serious riot took
place?  FROST-1840-1,218.2454

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2455

They were, I believe, chartists, or what you call chartists?
FROST-1840-1,218.2456

- They were taken as such.  FROST-1840-1,218.2457

From various parts of the town, I suppose?  FROST-1840-1,218.2458

- I do not know of any but from one part.  FROST-1840-1,218.2459

Or, as my learned friend suggests, the country, perhaps?
FROST-1840-1,218.2460

- I did not see them taken.  FROST-1840-1,218.2461

Then do not tell me any thing but what you know; FROST-1840-1,218.2462

several were taken somewhere or other; FROST-1840-1,218.2463

were they brought to the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,218.2464

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2465

Where were they placed in the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-1,218.2466

- I saw some taken into the long room.  FROST-1840-1,218.2467

Whereabouts is that room?  FROST-1840-1,218.2468

- It is the long room nearest to the yard gates.  FROST-1840-1,218.2469

Can you tell me by what letter it is described on that groundplan?
FROST-1840-1,218.2470

- The letter E.  FROST-1840-1,218.2471

Is that one of the rooms with a bow-window, or a projecting window -
FROST-1840-1,218.2472

never mind the strictness of the expression?  FROST-1840-1,218.2473

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2474

The one to the east?  FROST-1840-1,218.2475

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2476

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> The same room where the soldiers
were afterwards?  FROST-1840-1,218.2477

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,218.2478

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Were those persons kept somewhere or
other in the Westgate Inn in custody until the attack upon the house by
the mob?  FROST-1840-1,218.2479

- I saw them a little while before the attack upon the house by the mob.
FROST-1840-1,218.2480

I do not suppose you had your eye upon them the whole time.
FROST-1840-1,218.2481

- I believe them to have been in the house then.  FROST-1840-1,218.2482

How long before the mob appeared before the house was it that you last
saw any of them?  FROST-1840-1,218.2483

- I think it was about six o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,218.2484

In the morning?  FROST-1840-1,218.2485

- In the morning.  FROST-1840-1,218.2486

What room were they in then?  FROST-1840-1,218.2487

- They were then in the room next to the long room.  FROST-1840-1,218.2488

Is that the small room which is marked G, between the passage and
that room?  FROST-1840-1,218.2489

- It is between the passage and the long room.  FROST-1840-1,218.2490

<P_219>

Between the entrance and the soldier's room, as we call it?
FROST-1840-1,219.2492

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,219.2493

You saw some of them in that room about six, FROST-1840-1,219.2494

and you have no reason to suppose that they afterwards left?
FROST-1840-1,219.2495

- No; FROST-1840-1,219.2496

it may have been between five and six.  FROST-1840-1,219.2497

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Not in the great room?
FROST-1840-1,219.2498

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> No, my Lord, but about six he saw
them in the room marked G, between the soldier's room and the entrance.
FROST-1840-1,219.2499

<bracket> <font> To the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket> You had been
there from six; FROST-1840-1,219.2500

what were you doing with yourself from six, or whatever the time was,
till you returned to the Westgate, before the riot?  FROST-1840-1,219.2501

- About six I went out as far as the church.  FROST-1840-1,219.2502

I do not want to know precisely where you went; FROST-1840-1,219.2503

were you about the town?  FROST-1840-1,219.2504

- Yes; and I went home FROST-1840-1,219.2505

and had my breakfast, FROST-1840-1,219.2506

and washed myself; FROST-1840-1,219.2507

I felt tired, FROST-1840-1,219.2508

but I did not stay at home.  FROST-1840-1,219.2509

Then you went back FROST-1840-1,219.2510

and placed yourself with other special constables in the entrance?
FROST-1840-1,219.2511

- Yes, I was placed there.  FROST-1840-1,219.2512

Now tell me as exactly as you can, to the best of your recollection, how
soon after you returned there the soldiers came?  FROST-1840-1,219.2513

- They were going into the house as I returned.  FROST-1840-1,219.2514

I think you said that was about nine o'clock?  FROST-1840-1,219.2515

- I returned about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes before the firing
took place, before the row; FROST-1840-1,219.2516

it must have been about nine; FROST-1840-1,219.2517

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say the time.  FROST-1840-1,219.2518

You went into the inn at the same time with the soldiers,
FROST-1840-1,219.2519

and you had been in a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes before the firing
commenced?  FROST-1840-1,219.2520

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,219.2521

I thought I understood you to say it was 10 minutes or a quarter of an
hour, FROST-1840-1,219.2522

which would be the nearest?  FROST-1840-1,219.2523

- I should say it might be a quarter of an hour; FROST-1840-1,219.2524

it $may $be {TEXT:maybe} two or three minutes more or two or three
minutes less.  FROST-1840-1,219.2525

As near as you can say, it would be about a quarter of an hour before
the firing commenced?  FROST-1840-1,219.2526

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,219.2527

During that quarter of an hour did you remain all the time in the
entrance?  FROST-1840-1,219.2528

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,219.2529

Looking at the door?  FROST-1840-1,219.2530

- Looking at the outside of the door.  FROST-1840-1,219.2531

I mean that, looking, in fact, through the door-way?
FROST-1840-1,219.2532

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,219.2533

Were there several other persons besides yourself in the passage?
FROST-1840-1,219.2534

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,219.2535

The door all the time remained open?  FROST-1840-1,219.2536

- It did.  FROST-1840-1,219.2537

Never closed at all?  FROST-1840-1,219.2538

- Never closed at all after I got back.  FROST-1840-1,219.2539

Just tell me what was the first thing you saw of the riot which afterwards
ensued?  FROST-1840-1,219.2540

- I saw the persons coming down the hill; FROST-1840-1,219.2541

the first thing I heard previous to my seeing was the hurrahing.
FROST-1840-1,219.2542

Did that induce you to look out?  FROST-1840-1,219.2543

- No.  FROST-1840-1,219.2544

Then how and when was it that you saw the persons coming down the hill?
FROST-1840-1,219.2545

- I was standing at the door, FROST-1840-1,219.2546

and as they came <P_220> down the hill, when we heard the hurrahing,
the constables who were in the passage were pushing over my shoulder to
look towards the window to see them, FROST-1840-1,220.2547

and I kept pushing back, being an outside one, FROST-1840-1,220.2548

and as soon as ever they came round the corner I saw them.
FROST-1840-1,220.2549

Then did they immediately form, FROST-1840-1,220.2550

or were they in ranks in the way you have described?
FROST-1840-1,220.2551

- They were in ranks at the time they came down the hill.
FROST-1840-1,220.2552

At the time they came down the hill?  FROST-1840-1,220.2553

- Or round the corner, FROST-1840-1,220.2554

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say down the hill.  FROST-1840-1,220.2555

You have spoken of some person or other of the name of Walters,
FROST-1840-1,220.2556

and you have spoken of some one carrying a gun, FROST-1840-1,220.2557

do you mean the same person?  FROST-1840-1,220.2558

- Walters carried a gun, FROST-1840-1,220.2559

and another man carried a gun who came up to the door;
FROST-1840-1,220.2560

I have spoken of two carrying a gun, I believe.  FROST-1840-1,220.2561

Was there any one in particular who appeared to you to be the leader?
FROST-1840-1,220.2562

- I did not see any person in particular who appeared to be the leader.
FROST-1840-1,220.2563

Now just look at that - FROST-1840-1,220.2564

<bracket> <font> A paper being shown to the witness <$$font> <$$bracket>
- is that your deposition; FROST-1840-1,220.2565

did you make oath to the matters there written?  FROST-1840-1,220.2566

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,220.2567

On what day?  FROST-1840-1,220.2568

- I do not know when it is dated; FROST-1840-1,220.2569

I think it was on the 5th of November.  FROST-1840-1,220.2570

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> My Lord, I do not want to occupy the
time by reading the whole of this deposition, unless my learned friend
wishes it.  FROST-1840-1,220.2571

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I wish to have the whole
read.  FROST-1840-1,220.2572

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> I see there is one person mentioned
under the title of"leader,"FROST-1840-1,220.2573

whom do you mean?  FROST-1840-1,220.2574

- The first thing that catches my eye is,"when the leader said, 'Surrender
yourselves as our prisoners;'"FROST-1840-1,220.2575

that is the leader who came up to the door; FROST-1840-1,220.2576

I do not speak of the leader of the crowd.  FROST-1840-1,220.2577

There is the expression"leader"frequently used there;
FROST-1840-1,220.2578

is it the person whom you have named as Walters, or the other person
who had a gun?  FROST-1840-1,220.2579

- The other person; FROST-1840-1,220.2580

I meant when I said leader, the person who came up to the door;
FROST-1840-1,220.2581

it says,"when the leader said,'Surrender yourselves as our prisoners
'"- FROST-1840-1,220.2582

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> You had better confine yourself to
answering the question.  FROST-1840-1,220.2583

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It had better be read.
FROST-1840-1,220.2584

<bracket> <font> The Deposition of Thomas Bevan Oliver was read, as
follows: <$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-1,220.2585

{COM:deposition_omitted}

<P_221>

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Now, I will just repeat my question.
FROST-1840-1,221.2588

You observe, you call somebody or other"the leader,"and the" first of
the mob,"and so on.  FROST-1840-1,221.2589

I want to know who was that person?  FROST-1840-1,221.2590

- I believe it to be one that is dead.  FROST-1840-1,221.2591

"The leader;"FROST-1840-1,221.2592

there is the leader of those that came up to the door.
FROST-1840-1,221.2593

You need not go into further explanations.  FROST-1840-1,221.2594

If you can answer the question, do; FROST-1840-1,221.2595

if not, do not give me something that I do not ask for.
FROST-1840-1,221.2596

As to the name of the person, I understand you do not know that.
FROST-1840-1,221.2597

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He believes him to be one
of the persons that was killed.  FROST-1840-1,221.2598

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> How long after was it that the mob had
assembled before the door, that the question was asked about prisoners
which you have stated?  FROST-1840-1,221.2599

- I do not know that a minute elapsed.  FROST-1840-1,221.2600

Was it not one of the first things said or done?  FROST-1840-1,221.2601

- It was; FROST-1840-1,221.2602

that was after they had been hurrahing.  FROST-1840-1,221.2603

When they came to the front of the house where there was an <P_222>
open door, was not that one of the first things said or done by any of
that body of men?  FROST-1840-1,222.2604

- It was.  FROST-1840-1,222.2605

Was there a good deal of noise and confusion at that time?
FROST-1840-1,222.2606

- Outside.  FROST-1840-1,222.2607

You yourself, I understood you to say, were quite in the front?
FROST-1840-1,222.2608

- I was.  FROST-1840-1,222.2609

I do not mean to throw the least reflection upon you;
FROST-1840-1,222.2610

but were you not considerably alarmed at the time, from your position,
and seeing the persons before you?  FROST-1840-1,222.2611

- I was alarmed; FROST-1840-1,222.2612

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say considerably.  FROST-1840-1,222.2613

I presume you will not undertake to swear positively to the precise
words used by the person who said what you have mentioned concerning
the prisoners?  FROST-1840-1,222.2614

- Those, I believe, to have been the words.  FROST-1840-1,222.2615

I have no doubt you do, FROST-1840-1,222.2616

or you would not have sworn it.  FROST-1840-1,222.2617

I only ask you whether, considering the noise that prevailed at the time,
and your situation, and the alarm, be it small or great, that you felt,
you can undertake to swear positively to the words, FROST-1840-1,222.2618

or do you only believe that that was the substance and effect?
FROST-1840-1,222.2619

- There may be, perhaps, a single word; FROST-1840-1,222.2620

but I am sure I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,222.2621

I believe them to have been the words that were said.
FROST-1840-1,222.2622

Did you observe whether they were addressed to any particular person;
FROST-1840-1,222.2623

you have stated, somebody or other gave an answer?  FROST-1840-1,222.2624

- Yes, they were addressed to me; FROST-1840-1,222.2625

the man was about a yard from me, FROST-1840-1,222.2626

and he seemed to address himself to me, being on the outside, nearest
to him.  FROST-1840-1,222.2627

May they not have been addressed to the whole that were then assembled?
FROST-1840-1,222.2628

- Oh, yes.  FROST-1840-1,222.2629

Do you know who it was that cried out"never? "FROST-1840-1,222.2630

- No.  FROST-1840-1,222.2631

Was it one of your party?  FROST-1840-1,222.2632

- Some one from behind me.  FROST-1840-1,222.2633

Was there any body in that entrance but the special constables?
FROST-1840-1,222.2634

- Not that I know of.  FROST-1840-1,222.2635

You went away before the firing had completely finished?
FROST-1840-1,222.2636

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,222.2637

Did you remain within hearing?  FROST-1840-1,222.2638

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,222.2639

How long should you say that the firing continued?  FROST-1840-1,222.2640

- Perhaps, about ten minutes, as near as I can say.  FROST-1840-1,222.2641

You can, perhaps, tell me whether you know a person of the name of
Vincent?  FROST-1840-1,222.2642

- Yes; not personally.  FROST-1840-1,222.2643

Do you know that he has been in confinement here since the last summer
assizes?  FROST-1840-1,222.2644

- Yes; I was at his trial.  FROST-1840-1,222.2645

I believe he was what is called a chartist?  FROST-1840-1,222.2646

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,222.2647

Were there others tried at the same time of the same description of
persons?  FROST-1840-1,222.2648

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,222.2649

And they also were convicted and imprisoned?  FROST-1840-1,222.2650

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,222.2651

You have lived in Newport yourself?  FROST-1840-1,222.2652

- I have.  FROST-1840-1,222.2653

Do you know whether it was matter of public notoriety in Newport that
great complaints were made by the chartists <P_223> concerning the way
in which Vincent and the others were supposed to be treated in prison?
FROST-1840-1,223.2654

- I do not know.  FROST-1840-1,223.2655

I am not asking you whether they were so treated, but whether you know
that any complaints were ever made?  FROST-1840-1,223.2656

- No.  FROST-1840-1,223.2657

You are not at all aware that it was matter of notoriety that such
complaints and discontent had existed?  FROST-1840-1,223.2658

- No.  FROST-1840-1,223.2659

Are you at all connected with any newspaper?  FROST-1840-1,223.2660

- No, not here.  FROST-1840-1,223.2661

Any where?  FROST-1840-1,223.2662

- I reported the examinations before the magistrates for a newspaper.
FROST-1840-1,223.2663

Since this riot?  FROST-1840-1,223.2664

- Since the riot.  FROST-1840-1,223.2665

Never before?  FROST-1840-1,223.2666

- There is.  FROST-1840-1,224.2711

What is he, a tailor?  FROST-1840-1,224.2712

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,224.2713

At what time in the morning was it that you observed any thing unusual?
FROST-1840-1,224.2714

- About nine.  FROST-1840-1,224.2715

What was it that first attracted your attention?  FROST-1840-1,224.2716

- A great quantity of people coming down Stowe-hill, armed with different
kinds of weapons.  FROST-1840-1,224.2717

Could you at all form a judgment as to their numbers when you saw the
whole of them?  FROST-1840-1,224.2718

- I should think from 3,000 to 4,000 came round in front of the Westgate
; FROST-1840-1,224.2719

there were a great many people standing in front of the Westgate that
did not come down Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-1,224.2720

Could you see what number of people there were on Stowehill at that time?
FROST-1840-1,224.2721

- No.  FROST-1840-1,224.2722

You saw only those that wheeled round in front of the Westgate?
FROST-1840-1,224.2723

- Exactly.  FROST-1840-1,224.2724

In what sort of order did they appear to come?  FROST-1840-1,224.2725

- They marched seven or eight a-breast.  FROST-1840-1,224.2726

You would be upon the outside of them, from the Westgate?
FROST-1840-1,224.2727

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,224.2728

Do you speak accurately as to the number, FROST-1840-1,224.2729

or is that a sort of rough guess?  FROST-1840-1,224.2730

- A rough guess.  FROST-1840-1,224.2731

Was there any person who appeared to be in advance of the body?
FROST-1840-1,224.2732

- I did not notice but one man.  FROST-1840-1,224.2733

Was he armed?  FROST-1840-1,224.2734

- He was.  FROST-1840-1,224.2735

How?  FROST-1840-1,224.2736

- With a gun.  FROST-1840-1,224.2737

To what point did they first appear to you to direct themselves when
they came round the corner?  FROST-1840-1,224.2738

- The man that took my attention first went up the Westgate yard,
FROST-1840-1,224.2739

and tried the gates which go into the Westgate yard.
FROST-1840-1,224.2740

Were they open or fastened?  FROST-1840-1,224.2741

- They were fastened from the inside.  FROST-1840-1,224.2742

You say, you saw this man go up and try those gates?
FROST-1840-1,224.2743

- He went up in the direction of the gates; FROST-1840-1,224.2744

I could not see the gates; FROST-1840-1,224.2745

he went up, FROST-1840-1,224.2746

and came back again.  FROST-1840-1,224.2747

He went up to the gates, as if to go in, FROST-1840-1,224.2748

and then turned from them?  FROST-1840-1,224.2749

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,224.2750

Did you see him speak to any one when he turned from them?
FROST-1840-1,224.2751

- No, I did not.  FROST-1840-1,224.2752

In what direction did the persons who had wheeled round in front of
the Westgate go when the man had gone to the gate, <P_225> and had come
from it?  FROST-1840-1,225.2753

- The man that went to the gate returned back, FROST-1840-1,225.2754

and met the mob, FROST-1840-1,225.2755

and they all stopped in front of the Westgate.  FROST-1840-1,225.2756

The man that had gone up returned towards the body, FROST-1840-1,225.2757

and then they halted in front of the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,225.2758

- They did.  FROST-1840-1,225.2759

What was the next thing that you observed?  FROST-1840-1,225.2760

- This man fired a gun into the long room, in which the military were,
in the Westgate.  FROST-1840-1,225.2761

That was the man whom you had observed with the gun before?
FROST-1840-1,225.2762

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,225.2763

Is what you call the long-room the room nearest your house?
FROST-1840-1,225.2764

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,225.2765

Did you know whether there were any soldiers there at that time?
FROST-1840-1,225.2766

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-1,225.2767

Was that the room in which the soldiers were?  FROST-1840-1,225.2768

- It was.  FROST-1840-1,225.2769

Did you see any other of those persons who went up there armed, as you
say, do any thing at that window?  FROST-1840-1,225.2770

- No, I did not.  FROST-1840-1,225.2771

What was the next thing you saw done by either side?
FROST-1840-1,225.2772

- I heard several guns firing, FROST-1840-1,225.2773

and I saw the windows opened, FROST-1840-1,225.2774

and I went into my house FROST-1840-1,225.2775

and shut the door.  FROST-1840-1,225.2776

You saw the windows of that room opened, FROST-1840-1,225.2777

and then you went into your house FROST-1840-1,225.2778

and shut your door?  FROST-1840-1,225.2779

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,225.2780

And you saw no firing come from the soldiers?  FROST-1840-1,225.2781

- No, I did not.  FROST-1840-1,225.2782

Your house, I believe, is on the east side of Westgate-street?
FROST-1840-1,225.2786

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,225.2787

Is it nearly opposite the gates that you speak of, where somebody went up?
FROST-1840-1,225.2788

- Nearly opposite.  FROST-1840-1,225.2789

How many persons went up to those gates?  FROST-1840-1,225.2790

- I did not see but the one.  FROST-1840-1,225.2791

But you saw that one go and come away again?  FROST-1840-1,225.2792

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,225.2793

Where were the soldiers?  FROST-1840-1,225.2794

- In the long-room.  FROST-1840-1,225.2795

Which do you call the long-room?  FROST-1840-1,225.2796

- The nearest room to my house; FROST-1840-1,225.2797

there are three windows in it.  FROST-1840-1,225.2798

I think your attention had never been called to these occurrences till you
heard the noise of persons coming round the corner?  FROST-1840-1,225.2799

- Yes; it was, because I shut my shop about half-past seven o'clock.
FROST-1840-1,225.2800

You were asked what time you observed any thing; FROST-1840-1,225.2801

you said about nine o'clock; FROST-1840-1,225.2802

you shut your shop between seven and eight?  FROST-1840-1,225.2803

- Between seven and eight.  FROST-1840-1,225.2804

And about nine o'clock you heard this noise of people coming round
the corner?  FROST-1840-1,225.2805

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-1,225.2806

You say your shutters were shut?  FROST-1840-1,225.2807

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,225.2808

How were the shutters of the inn at the time that the people turned
round the corner?  FROST-1840-1,225.2809

- The shutters are divided in half, FROST-1840-1,225.2810

and the lower part of them, which is about six feet from the <P_226>
ground, were shut, FROST-1840-1,226.2811

and the top shutters were open of the longroom.  FROST-1840-1,226.2812

Do you know the room?  FROST-1840-1,226.2813

- Yes, perfectly well.  FROST-1840-1,226.2814

When the shutters are shut, are they not six feet from the ground?
FROST-1840-1,226.2815

- Yes, they are.  FROST-1840-1,226.2816

So that persons standing on the floor of the room could not look over
them?  FROST-1840-1,226.2817

- No, they $can $not {TEXT:cannot}.  FROST-1840-1,226.2818

Does the ground slope away from the inn?  FROST-1840-1,226.2819

- Yes, it does.  FROST-1840-1,226.2820

Were those shutters close shut?  FROST-1840-1,226.2821

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,226.2822

; FROST-1840-1,226.2826

how near were the body to him at that time?  FROST-1840-1,226.2827

- I should think about ten or twelve yards from him.

<$$heading>

I believe you are a tailor, residing at Newport?  FROST-1840-1,226.2833

- I am.  FROST-1840-1,226.2834

Do you live next door to the last witness, Mr. Henry Evans?
FROST-1840-1,226.2835

- I do.  FROST-1840-1,226.2836

Is that in Westgate-street?  FROST-1840-1,226.2837

- It is nearly opposite the Westgate Inn.  FROST-1840-1,226.2838

Were you at home on the morning of the 4th of November?
FROST-1840-1,226.2839

- I was.  FROST-1840-1,226.2840

Do you remember standing at your door about nine o'clock in the morning?
FROST-1840-1,226.2841

- I do.  FROST-1840-1,226.2842

Was your shop open or shut at that time?  FROST-1840-1,226.2843

- It was shut; FROST-1840-1,226.2844

I had drawn the shutters down.  FROST-1840-1,226.2845

Were you standing on the outside of your door or in your door-way?
FROST-1840-1,226.2846

- I stood with the knob of the door in my hand shut, and I on the outside.
FROST-1840-1,226.2847

About the time you have mentioned, about nine o'clock in the morning,
did you see any body of persons coming round the corner from Stowe-hill?
FROST-1840-1,226.2848

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,226.2849

What number of persons appeared to you to come round the corner at
that time?  FROST-1840-1,226.2850

- I stood at my own door till they got round; FROST-1840-1,226.2851

they came, I suppose, within ten yards of where I stood;
FROST-1840-1,226.2852

they came round FROST-1840-1,226.2853

and stopped opposite the large doors that go into the Westgate yard;
FROST-1840-1,226.2854

they halted, FROST-1840-1,226.2855

and when they saw those doors shut, they wheeled round towards the
Westgate door in front.  FROST-1840-1,226.2856

Do you mean the front centre door of the house?  FROST-1840-1,226.2857

- The front, the entrance into the house.  FROST-1840-1,226.2858

You say, they went first to the great gates, and then they returned
from thence.  FROST-1840-1,226.2859

What did they do then?  FROST-1840-1,226.2860

- When they saw those doors shut, they wheeled round,
FROST-1840-1,226.2861

and turned towards the Westgate steps.  FROST-1840-1,226.2862

They turned towards the centre of the house?  FROST-1840-1,226.2863

- They did.  FROST-1840-1,226.2864

<P_227>

Is that the porch?  FROST-1840-1,227.2866

- That is the porch.  FROST-1840-1,227.2867

There would then be a part of them between the Westgate and your house?
FROST-1840-1,227.2868

- There were a great number, hundreds; FROST-1840-1,227.2869

I should say that there may have been from 400 to 500 at the time;
FROST-1840-1,227.2870

for I could see them still at the other side, like as if they were
still coming.  FROST-1840-1,227.2871

Were they still coming in the direction of Stowe-hill?
FROST-1840-1,227.2872

Yes, I saw none coming up Commercial-street.  FROST-1840-1,227.2873

All that you saw came from Stowe-hill, FROST-1840-1,227.2874

and they appeared coming on to fill the space in front?
FROST-1840-1,227.2875

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,227.2876

Had they any arms?  FROST-1840-1,227.2877

- They had.  FROST-1840-1,227.2878

Of what description?  FROST-1840-1,227.2879

- The first man held a sword in his hand, FROST-1840-1,227.2880

and then there were various persons with guns and spikes and pikes.
FROST-1840-1,227.2881

When I say"pikes,"I mean a long stick, with an iron fixed in the end
of it.  FROST-1840-1,227.2882

Spiked with iron?  FROST-1840-1,227.2883

- Yes; FROST-1840-1,227.2884

and others with some pitch-forks, that is, hay-forks with two prongs.
FROST-1840-1,227.2885

As they stood there, did you hear any exclamation from any one of
the party?  FROST-1840-1,227.2886

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,227.2887

Was that after they were formed?  FROST-1840-1,227.2888

- After they had wheeled round, and were going up the steps, I heard
the word given by one person.  FROST-1840-1,227.2889

What was it he said?  FROST-1840-1,227.2890

- I do not know what he said; FROST-1840-1,227.2891

I think it was,"In, my men;"or,"In, my boys," FROST-1840-1,227.2892

and at that time I lost sight of them.  FROST-1840-1,227.2893

Did you distinctly hear those words?  FROST-1840-1,227.2894

- Quite distinctly.  FROST-1840-1,227.2895

Had there been any firing before you heard those words from one of
the party?  FROST-1840-1,227.2896

- Not that I am aware of.  FROST-1840-1,227.2897

You say at the time those words were uttered, the party were in fact
going up the steps?  FROST-1840-1,227.2898

- The party were going up the steps, FROST-1840-1,227.2899

and I could see guns and pikes going up the steps.  FROST-1840-1,227.2900

Did you see any firing at that time?  FROST-1840-1,227.2901

- I could hear firing at the time in the passage; FROST-1840-1,227.2902

at the time they were beating the windows.  FROST-1840-1,227.2903

At the time that part of the party were breaking the windows, you heard
firing in the passage?  FROST-1840-1,227.2904

- In the passage.  FROST-1840-1,227.2905

Do you know the room where the soldiers were?  FROST-1840-1,227.2906

- Perfectly well.  FROST-1840-1,227.2907

Did you observe any person in the Westgate open the shutters?
FROST-1840-1,227.2908

- I stood at my own door, FROST-1840-1,227.2909

and the moment that I saw and heard the firing commence in the room
before the shutters were opened, I went in FROST-1840-1,227.2910

and locked the door.  FROST-1840-1,227.2911

You say,"in the room,"FROST-1840-1,227.2912

do you mean in the passage?  FROST-1840-1,227.2913

- The firing commenced from the mob on the front door;
FROST-1840-1,227.2914

I was standing at my own door.  FROST-1840-1,227.2915

<P_228>

Was that before any one opened the window-shutters?  FROST-1840-1,228.2917

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,228.2918

Were those lower window-shutters closed at the time when the mob came up?
FROST-1840-1,228.2919

- They were.  FROST-1840-1,228.2920

Did you see any firing into the room from the party?
FROST-1840-1,228.2921

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,228.2922

Was that before the shutters were opened?  FROST-1840-1,228.2923

- After the shutters were opened; FROST-1840-1,228.2924

they were opening the shutters at the time the firing was at the windows.
FROST-1840-1,228.2925

Upon that, did you remain there, FROST-1840-1,228.2926

or did you go into your house?  FROST-1840-1,228.2927

- Before the soldiers began to fire, I was not aware that they were in
that room; FROST-1840-1,228.2928

the moment I found that they were in there, I saw it was full time for
me to go; FROST-1840-1,228.2929

I went in FROST-1840-1,228.2930

and locked the door, FROST-1840-1,228.2931

and ran up stairs to the window at the top of my own house,
FROST-1840-1,228.2932

and there I could see them quite plain.  FROST-1840-1,228.2933

Then there was no firing at all from the Westgate before the
window-shutters were opened?  FROST-1840-1,228.2934

- There may have been firing in the passage.  FROST-1840-1,228.2935

Had there been any firing from the Westgate into the street before the
window-shutters were open?  FROST-1840-1,228.2936

- The soldiers, I believe, fired before the shutters were opened,
FROST-1840-1,228.2937

but I think they fired up; FROST-1840-1,228.2938

they could not fire upon the mob; FROST-1840-1,228.2939

they could not see them.  FROST-1840-1,228.2940

They could not possibly fire upon the mob till the shutters were open?
FROST-1840-1,228.2941

- They could not.  FROST-1840-1,228.2942

Did the upper window, that you went to, command a view of the front of
the Westgate?  FROST-1840-1,228.2943

- Entirely.  FROST-1840-1,228.2944

What did you observe from thence?  FROST-1840-1,228.2945

- I was there about half a minute before the first man was shot;
FROST-1840-1,228.2946

I saw him falling after the soldiers'window was opened;
FROST-1840-1,228.2947

he fell nearly by the corner; FROST-1840-1,228.2948

the next fell upon the steps; FROST-1840-1,228.2949

he was in the act of going in when he was shot; FROST-1840-1,228.2950

one arm was in the door when he fell, FROST-1840-1,228.2951

and the other man was shot from the nearest window to the porch;
FROST-1840-1,228.2952

he was nearly an hour and a quarter before he died.  FROST-1840-1,228.2953

The next man jumped out of the window next the corner;
FROST-1840-1,228.2954

he went upon his hands and knees.  FROST-1840-1,228.2955

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It is not necessary to go into
these details.  FROST-1840-1,228.2956

Mr. Serjeant <font> Talfourd.  <$$font> Not at all.
FROST-1840-1,228.2957

Did you see what effect the firing of the soldiers had upon the crowd
without?  FROST-1840-1,228.2958

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,228.2959

What was it?  FROST-1840-1,228.2960

- The moment they saw the first man falling they all began to disperse;
FROST-1840-1,228.2961

they were running in all directions.  FROST-1840-1,228.2962

When you got up to the window at the top of the house, I suppose the
windows of the Westgate were open?  FROST-1840-1,228.2963

- They were open.  FROST-1840-1,228.2964

the door?  FROST-1840-1,228.2968

- I saw them first coming round from the direction of Stowe-hill.
FROST-1840-1,228.2969

You say the first man held a sword in his hand; FROST-1840-1,228.2970

who was the first man?  FROST-1840-1,228.2971

- I believe that the first man that came in was Rees the Fifer, as they

Whom was it that you next saw that had a gun?  FROST-1840-1,229.2974

- John Lovett.  FROST-1840-1,229.2975

Where did he come from?  FROST-1840-1,229.2976

- He came along with the mob.  FROST-1840-1,229.2977

Was he outside, or in the middle, or where?  FROST-1840-1,229.2978

- He was not in the middle; FROST-1840-1,229.2979

he walked alongside.  FROST-1840-1,229.2980

How many men did you see with guns?  FROST-1840-1,229.2981

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that.  FROST-1840-1,229.2982

Were there several?  FROST-1840-1,229.2983

- A great number.  FROST-1840-1,229.2984

Were they in front of the Westgate Inn together?  FROST-1840-1,229.2985

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that they were together, because when they
came to the front of the big doors they appeared to be rather confused,
because they found no entrance in, and then they turned back again.
FROST-1840-1,229.2986

I want to know whether those persons who had guns when they first appeared
in front of the Westgate Inn were all together, FROST-1840-1,229.2987

or was there now and then a man with a gun, and now and then a man
without one; FROST-1840-1,229.2988

how was it?  FROST-1840-1,229.2989

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} answer for that; FROST-1840-1,229.2990

I can only tell you that I saw a great number with guns.
FROST-1840-1,229.2991

In different places?  FROST-1840-1,229.2992

- They were mingled together before they came round; FROST-1840-1,229.2993

and when they came back again, of course I could not say.
FROST-1840-1,229.2994

Did any one more than another appear to you to be the leader?
FROST-1840-1,229.2995

- I did not notice any thing of that, more than I heard the word
distinctly from the one man.  FROST-1840-1,229.2996

Was there no one who appeared to you to be the leader?
FROST-1840-1,229.2997

- Only this Rees the Fifer had a sword in his hand, FROST-1840-1,229.2998

and he seemed to wave the sword.  FROST-1840-1,229.2999

Is he the one you would call the leader?  FROST-1840-1,229.3000

- I do not call him the leader more than the others, because they all
appeared to be voluntarily coming up.  FROST-1840-1,229.3001

Then I am to understand you to swear, that there was no one more than
another that you would call the leader?  FROST-1840-1,229.3002

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} name one more than another.
FROST-1840-1,229.3003

Was there in fact any one more than another that you would call the
leader; yes or no?  FROST-1840-1,229.3004

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} answer the question in that respect, because
I saw them all voluntarily going one with another.  FROST-1840-1,229.3005

Then do you think there was no leader?  FROST-1840-1,229.3006

- No, I will not say that; FROST-1840-1,229.3007

certainly there must have been a leader in bringing them to the place.
FROST-1840-1,229.3008

I am asking you not about what must have been, but what you saw;
FROST-1840-1,229.3009

from what you saw was there any one, or was there not, who appeared to
you to be the leader?  FROST-1840-1,229.3010

- I did not observe any one, not to swear to him; FROST-1840-1,229.3011

but they all appeared to me in full action in coming along.
FROST-1840-1,229.3012

Then you did not observe any one who appeared to be a leader?
FROST-1840-1,229.3013

- - I did not observe any one alone but that one, and the man that I
heard give the command.  FROST-1840-1,229.3014

When the soldiers fired out upon the mob, when the shutters were open
and they could fire freely, did not the mob disperse almost instantly
afterwards?  FROST-1840-1,229.3015

- As soon as they saw the first man shot they did, but not before.
FROST-1840-1,229.3016

<P_230>

Was not that as soon as the soldiers began to fire?  FROST-1840-1,230.3018

- Yes, FROST-1840-1,230.3019

but the passage was full, FROST-1840-1,230.3020

and they were getting in through the windows; FROST-1840-1,230.3021

but when they saw the first man fall, then they began to disperse.
FROST-1840-1,230.3022

I want to know whether that was when the soldiers first began to fire
out in the front?  FROST-1840-1,230.3023

- They were nearly full in front when they saw men falling,
FROST-1840-1,230.3024

and then they began to disperse.  FROST-1840-1,230.3025

I want to know whether the men did not fall the moment the soldiers
began to fire out in front?  FROST-1840-1,230.3026

- No.  FROST-1840-1,230.3027

Then how long afterwards?  FROST-1840-1,230.3028

- They fired, I dare say, about a minute, or nearly thereabouts , because
they were firing while I was going up stairs.  FROST-1840-1,230.3029

Did you see them firing out in front?  FROST-1840-1,230.3030

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,230.3031

Do you mean to say they were firing out a minute, or any thing like a
minute, before any body was hit?  FROST-1840-1,230.3032

- Yes; I could not go up stairs under half a minute.
FROST-1840-1,230.3033

Where were you when you saw them first firing?  FROST-1840-1,230.3034

- At my own door.  FROST-1840-1,230.3035

Did you observe the shutters opened?  FROST-1840-1,230.3036

- They were opening the shutters.  FROST-1840-1,230.3037

Which shutters did they open first?  FROST-1840-1,230.3038

- There were only the lower shutters closed.  FROST-1840-1,230.3039

I suppose it is not one shutter to the whole of the window?
FROST-1840-1,230.3040

- No; FROST-1840-1,230.3041

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say exactly which window, because there were
soldiers at each window.  FROST-1840-1,230.3042

There were three windows?  FROST-1840-1,230.3043

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,230.3044

Do you remember out of which they fired first?  FROST-1840-1,230.3045

- No; I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,230.3046

Did they fire sooner out of one than another, FROST-1840-1,230.3047

or did they fire out of all together?  FROST-1840-1,230.3048

- That I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} answer.  FROST-1840-1,230.3049

Am I to understand you to say, that you did not observe sufficiently to
enable you to tell me whether the soldiers fired first out of one window,
or whether they fired out of the whole together?  FROST-1840-1,230.3050

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say out of which window they fired first.
FROST-1840-1,230.3051

Can you say that they fired out of any one before they fired out of
the others?  FROST-1840-1,230.3052

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  FROST-1840-1,230.3053

How long after you got up stairs was it that the mob $was {TEXT:was_was}
dispersed, or began to disperse?  FROST-1840-1,230.3054

- I should think I was up stairs about half a minute before the first
man was shot; FROST-1840-1,230.3055

and I dare say I was about half a minute going up stairs.

Are you park-keeper to Sir Charles Morgan?  FROST-1840-1,230.3061

Is his mansion called Tredegar Park?  FROST-1840-1,230.3063

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,230.3064

Is there a lodge-gate of Tredegar Park upon the high road that leads
from Newport to Cardiff?  FROST-1840-1,230.3065

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,230.3066

<P_231>

Do you know the person of John Frost, the prisoner?  FROST-1840-1,231.3068

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,231.3069

Do you remember being standing by that lodge on the side of the turnpike
road upon the Monday the 4th of November?  FROST-1840-1,231.3070

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,231.3071

Did you see any number of people coming fast along that road?
FROST-1840-1,231.3072

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,231.3073

What time was it you were there?  FROST-1840-1,231.3074

- I should think it was very nearly ten o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,231.3075

In the morning?  FROST-1840-1,231.3076

- In the morning.  FROST-1840-1,231.3077

How far is that lodge-gate from the town of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,231.3078

- I should think about two miles and three-quarters, as near as I can say.
FROST-1840-1,231.3079

About the time you have mentioned, did you see any number of people coming
in the direction from Newport towards Cardiff?  FROST-1840-1,231.3080

- Yes; I should think from two to three hundred running and walking.
FROST-1840-1,231.3081

Did you speak to any of them?  FROST-1840-1,231.3082

- I asked a great number of them what was the matter.
FROST-1840-1,231.3083

I do not want to have all that.  FROST-1840-1,231.3084

You spoke to some of them as they passed by?  FROST-1840-1,231.3085

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,231.3086

Did you get any answer?  FROST-1840-1,231.3087

- I could not get any answer from some of them.  FROST-1840-1,231.3088

Did a person come up to you whom you now know to be Frost?
FROST-1840-1,231.3089

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,231.3090

Had he a handkerchief in his hand?  FROST-1840-1,231.3091

- Yes, in his left hand; FROST-1840-1,231.3092

and I thought he was crying.  FROST-1840-1,231.3093

Up to his face as if he were crying?  FROST-1840-1,231.3094

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,231.3095

At what sort of pace was he coming by you?  FROST-1840-1,231.3096

- A good walk, not running; a good strong walk.  FROST-1840-1,231.3097

Was he coming in the direction in which you told us the other people
had gone from Newport towards Cardiff?  FROST-1840-1,231.3098

- Yes; FROST-1840-1,231.3099

I did not know it was Frost.  FROST-1840-1,231.3100

He had his handkerchief up to his face?  FROST-1840-1,231.3101

- Yes; FROST-1840-1,231.3102

and I asked him what was the matter at Newport that the people were all
running away for.  FROST-1840-1,231.3103

Upon that did he take his handkerchief from his face?
FROST-1840-1,231.3104

- Yes; FROST-1840-1,231.3105

and then I asked him,"Oh, how do you do? "FROST-1840-1,231.3106

Upon his taking his handkerchief from his face, did you know it was Frost?
FROST-1840-1,231.3107

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-1,231.3108

Did he make you any answer when you asked what was the matter?
FROST-1840-1,231.3109

- He did; FROST-1840-1,231.3110

but I did not understand what the word was.  FROST-1840-1,231.3111

Did he stop, FROST-1840-1,231.3112

or did he pass on?  FROST-1840-1,231.3113

- He passed on at the same pace.  FROST-1840-1,231.3114

At the same pace at which you had observed him coming towards you?
FROST-1840-1,231.3115

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,231.3116

In what direction did he pass on?  FROST-1840-1,231.3117

- He went on towards Cardiff, on the Cardiff road.  FROST-1840-1,231.3118

Were you on foot, or on horseback?  FROST-1840-1,231.3119

- On my horse.  FROST-1840-1,231.3120

<P_232>

Did you turn your horse to look after him?  FROST-1840-1,232.3122

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-1,232.3123

Did he keep the road, FROST-1840-1,232.3124

or did you see him turn out of the road?  FROST-1840-1,232.3125

- He kept the road, I should think, for about 200 yards.
FROST-1840-1,232.3126

Where did he go to when he quitted the road?  FROST-1840-1,232.3127

- He turned down a gateway into a field, FROST-1840-1,232.3128

and then there is a kind of a copse or a break which comes down the side
of the park wall.  FROST-1840-1,232.3129

Is that round the corner of the park wall?  FROST-1840-1,232.3130

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,232.3131

Is there any public pathway in the field he turned into?
FROST-1840-1,232.3132

- No; FROST-1840-1,232.3133

and then I lost sight of him.  FROST-1840-1,232.3134

What sort of place was it that you saw him go into when you last saw him?
FROST-1840-1,232.3135

- A kind of a riding-gate to go into the park for hunting;
FROST-1840-1,232.3136

I could not see him go through that gate, FROST-1840-1,232.3137

and there I lost him.  FROST-1840-1,232.3138

Is there a gate there?  FROST-1840-1,232.3139

- Yes; a narrow strip of break runs down the side of the wall.
FROST-1840-1,232.3140

Is that copse?  FROST-1840-1,232.3141

- Copse-wood, about five or six yards wide.  FROST-1840-1,232.3142

Making a belt to the park?  FROST-1840-1,232.3143

- Behind the park wall.  FROST-1840-1,232.3144

So that this break or belt of wood went along round the park wall?
FROST-1840-1,232.3145

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,232.3146

Did you see him enter that belt of wood?  FROST-1840-1,232.3147

- I saw him in that arch, FROST-1840-1,232.3148

and then I did not look after him any further.  FROST-1840-1,232.3149

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> That arch leads into the

it is not quite a mile from the Ebbw-bridge {COM:sic} to where I saw him;
FROST-1840-1,232.3171

it is rather within a mile.  FROST-1840-1,232.3172

Can you point out where it is; FROST-1840-1,232.3183

is the gate you are speaking of nearer to Cardiff, or nearer to Newport,
than the lodge?  FROST-1840-1,232.3184

- Nearer Cardiff than the lodge.  FROST-1840-1,232.3185

<P_233>

How much beyond the lodge?  FROST-1840-1,233.3187

- I should think about three or four hundred yards.  FROST-1840-1,233.3188

Less than a quarter of a mile?  FROST-1840-1,233.3189

- Yes, less than a quarter of a mile.  FROST-1840-1,233.3190

As you enter the lodge, is there a piece of water on your left hand?

On the 4th of November last, were you mayor of the borough of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,233.3201

Having been mayor, I presume, from the 9th of November preceding?
FROST-1840-1,233.3203

- Yes.  FROST-1840-1,233.3204

In the course of Sunday, the 3d of November, did you receive any
intelligence that induced you to take any steps for preserving the
public peace?  FROST-1840-1,233.3205

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,233.3206

Did you give any orders to the special constables?  FROST-1840-1,233.3207

- I gave orders to the superintendent of police to have a number
of special constables in attendance on the evening of that day.
FROST-1840-1,233.3208

Without inquiring into the particulars of the intelligence, was
it intelligence that there was some movement in the hill district?
FROST-1840-1,233.3209

- It was directed upon Newport.  FROST-1840-1,233.3210

How were the special constables stationed in the evening of the Sunday?
FROST-1840-1,233.3211

- In the early part of the evening they were divided at three houses;
the King's Head, the Westgate and the Parrot.  FROST-1840-1,233.3212

Are those the three principal inns in the town of Newport?
FROST-1840-1,233.3213

- They are the three principal inns in the town; FROST-1840-1,233.3214

but at a later period of the evening those who had been in attendance at
the Parrot were removed to the Westgate, so that from that period they
were divided into two parties, one at the King's Head and the other at
the Westgate.  FROST-1840-1,233.3215

Did you concert measures with any other magistrates for the safety of
the town?  FROST-1840-1,233.3216

- I did, with Mr. Brewer and Mr. Edwards, both of whom
were then magistrates of the borough.  FROST-1840-1,233.3217

In the course of the afternoon I explained to the Lord Liutenant of the
county - FROST-1840-1,233.3218

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> You had better tell us what you
did, not what you said to any body.  FROST-1840-1,233.3219

FROST-1840-1,233.3220

Had the magistrates met at the Westgate Inn before; FROST-1840-1,234.3225

was it a place where they had been accustomed to meet?
FROST-1840-1,234.3226

- No, it was not.  FROST-1840-1,234.3227

When did Mr. Brewer and you station yourselves at the Westgate?
FROST-1840-1,234.3228

- About nine o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,234.3229

In what room in the inn?  FROST-1840-1,234.3230

- <bracket> <font> A plan was handed to the witness.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-1,234.3231

- That is the room in which we were stationed - <bracket> <font>
pointing it out upon the plan <$$font> <$$bracket> - the next room to
the bow-window.  FROST-1840-1,234.3232

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> That is the room, next
the bow-window room on the west side?  FROST-1840-1,234.3233

- There are two rooms between the bow-window and the door-way;
FROST-1840-1,234.3234

the room in which we were was the {COM:missing_word} next to the
bow-window.  FROST-1840-1,234.3235

The room G. next to F.  FROST-1840-1,234.3236

, next to the commercial-room?  FROST-1840-1,234.3237

- It is.  FROST-1840-1,234.3238

Did you remain there through the night?  FROST-1840-1,234.3239

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,234.3240

Did you receive any intelligence of the approach of any persons towards
Newport?  FROST-1840-1,234.3241

- We did.  FROST-1840-1,234.3242

About what hour?  FROST-1840-1,234.3243

- I had received communications before I went to the Westgate, as early
as six o'clock in the evening.  FROST-1840-1,234.3244

After we went to the Westgate we had further communications, from the
period very soon after we got there till daybreak.  FROST-1840-1,234.3245

Did you send out persons to bring you information?  FROST-1840-1,234.3246

- We sent out a detachment of constables, who were relieved every two
hours; FROST-1840-1,234.3247

their directions were to keep up the communications.
FROST-1840-1,234.3248

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Really I must object to this.
FROST-1840-1,234.3249

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Directions given to the
constables, I should think, are evidence.  FROST-1840-1,234.3250

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> No; FROST-1840-1,234.3251

all we can hear is, what the witness himself did, or what he saw done.
FROST-1840-1,234.3252

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> He gave those directions.
FROST-1840-1,234.3253

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> If the constables did any thing in
pursuance of those directions, they can prove that; FROST-1840-1,234.3254

but my learned friend means to infer from this, that the constables
did something.  FROST-1840-1,234.3255

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He only asked whether the
witness received intelligence.  FROST-1840-1,234.3256

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Did you send out persons
to procure you intelligence?  FROST-1840-1,234.3257

- We did.  FROST-1840-1,234.3258

Did they from time to time bring you intelligence?  FROST-1840-1,234.3259

- They did.  FROST-1840-1,234.3260

Do you recollect sending out a person of the name of Walker?
FROST-1840-1,234.3261

- I did.  FROST-1840-1,234.3262

About what hour was Walker sent out?  FROST-1840-1,234.3263

- I should think about six o'clock.  FROST-1840-1,234.3264

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Six in the morning?
FROST-1840-1,234.3265

- No, in the afternoon; before I had got to the Westgate.
FROST-1840-1,234.3266

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Was he sent again the
next morning?  FROST-1840-1,234.3267

- No; he came back wounded.  FROST-1840-1,234.3268
