My own life.  HUME-1776-2,1.7

<$$heading>

It is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity;
HUME-1776-2,1.9

therefore, I shall be short.  HUME-1776-2,1.10

It may be thought an instance of vanity that I pretend at all to write
my life; HUME-1776-2,1.11

but this Narrative shall contain little more than the History of my
Writings; as, indeed, almost all my life has been spent in literary
pursuits and occupations.  HUME-1776-2,1.12

The first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object
of vanity.  HUME-1776-2,1.13

I was born the 26th of April 1711, old style, at Edinburgh.
HUME-1776-2,1.14

I was of a good family, both by father and mother: HUME-1776-2,1.15

my father's family is a branch of the Earl of <P_2> $Home $'s
{TEXT:Home's}, or $Hume $'s {TEXT:Hume's}; HUME-1776-2,2.16

and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate, which my brother
possesses, for several generations.  HUME-1776-2,2.17

My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, President of the College
of Justice; HUME-1776-2,2.18

the title of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother.
HUME-1776-2,2.19

My family, however, was not rich; HUME-1776-2,2.20

and being myself a younger brother, my patrimony, according to the mode
of my country, was of course very slender.  HUME-1776-2,2.21

My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant,
leaving me, with an elder brother and a sister, under the care of our
mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and handsome,
devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children.
HUME-1776-2,2.22

I passed through the ordinary course of education with success,
HUME-1776-2,2.23

and was seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been
the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments.
HUME-1776-2,2.24

My studious disposition, my sobriety, and my industry, gave my family
a notion that the law was a proper profession for me; HUME-1776-2,2.25

but I found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits
of philosophy and general learning; HUME-1776-2,2.26

and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and
Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring.  HUME-1776-2,2.27

<P_3>

My very slender fortune, however, being unsuitable to this plan of
life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I
was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering
into a more active scene of life.  HUME-1776-2,3.29

In 1734, I went to Bristol, with some recommendations to eminent
merchants, HUME-1776-2,3.30

but in a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me.
HUME-1776-2,3.31

I went over to France, with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country
retreat; HUME-1776-2,3.32

and I there laid that plan of life, which I have steadily and successfully
pursued.  HUME-1776-2,3.33

I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune
, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object
as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature.
HUME-1776-2,3.34

During my retreat in France, first at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche
, in Anjou, I composed my <font> Treatise of Human Nature <$$font>.
HUME-1776-2,3.35

After passing three years very agreeably in that country, I came over
to London in 1737.  HUME-1776-2,3.36

In the end of 1738, I published my Treatise, HUME-1776-2,3.37

and immediately went down to my mother and my brother, who lived at his
country-house, and was employing himself very judiciously and successfully
in the improvement of this fortune.  HUME-1776-2,3.38

<P_4>

Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of Human
Nature.  HUME-1776-2,4.40

It fell <font> dead born from the press <$$font>, without reaching
such distinction, as even to excite a murmur among the zealots.
HUME-1776-2,4.41

But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I very soon
recovered the blow, HUME-1776-2,4.42

and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country.
HUME-1776-2,4.43

In 1742, I printed at Edinburgh the first part of my Essays:
HUME-1776-2,4.44

the work was favorably received, HUME-1776-2,4.45

and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment.
HUME-1776-2,4.46

I continued with my mother and brother in the country, HUME-1776-2,4.47

and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language, which
I had too much neglected in my early youth.  HUME-1776-2,4.48

In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me
to come and live with him in England; HUME-1776-2,4.49

I found also, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were
desirous of putting him under my care and direction, HUME-1776-2,4.50

for the state of his mind and health required it.  HUME-1776-2,4.51

- I lived with him a twelvemonth.  HUME-1776-2,4.52

My appointments during that time made a considerable accession to my
small fortune.  HUME-1776-2,4.53

I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him
as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada
, but ended in an incursion on the coast of France.  HUME-1776-2,4.54

Next year, to wit, 1747, <P_5> I received an invitation from the General
to attend him in the same station in his military embassy to the courts
of Vienna and Turin.  HUME-1776-2,5.55

I then wore the uniform of an officer, HUME-1776-2,5.56

and was introduced at these courts as aid-de-camp {COM:sic} to the General
, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, now General Grant.
HUME-1776-2,5.57

These two years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have
received during the course of my life: HUME-1776-2,5.58

I passed them agreeably, and in good company; HUME-1776-2,5.59

and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune,
which I called independent, though most of my friends were inclined to
smile when I said so; HUME-1776-2,5.60

in short I was now master of near a thousand pounds.  HUME-1776-2,5.61

I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in publishing
the Treatise of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than
the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion,
in going to the press too early.  HUME-1776-2,5.62

I, therefore, cast the first part of that work anew in the Enquiry
concerning Human Understanding, which was published while I was at Turin.
HUME-1776-2,5.63

But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of
Human Nature.  HUME-1776-2,5.64

On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all England in
a ferment, on account of Dr. Middleton's Free Enquiry, while my
performance <P_6> was entirely overlooked and neglected.  HUME-1776-2,6.65

A new edition, which had been published at London of my Essays, moral
and political, met not with a much better reception.  HUME-1776-2,6.66

Such is the force of natural temper, that these disappointments made
little or no impression on me.  HUME-1776-2,6.67

I went down in 1749, HUME-1776-2,6.68

and lived two years with my brother at his country house; HUME-1776-2,6.69

for my mother was now dead.  HUME-1776-2,6.70

I there composed the second part of my Essays, which I called Political
Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals,
which is another part of my Treatise that I cast anew.  HUME-1776-2,6.71

Meanwhile, my bookseller, A. Millar, informed me, that my
former publications <paren> all but the unfortunate Treatise <$$paren>
were beginning to be the subject of conversation; that the sale of
them was gradually increasing, and that new editions were demanded.
HUME-1776-2,6.72

Answers by Reverends, and Right Reverends, came out two or three in a
year; HUME-1776-2,6.73

and I found, by Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were
beginning to be esteemed in good company.  HUME-1776-2,6.74

However, I had fixed a resolution, which I inflexibly maintained, never
to reply to any body; HUME-1776-2,6.75

and not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself
clear of all literary squabbles.  HUME-1776-2,6.76

These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement, as I was
ever more disposed to see the favourable than unfavourable side of <P_7>
things; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be
born to an estate of ten thousand a year.  HUME-1776-2,7.77

In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true scene of a
man of letters.  HUME-1776-2,7.78

In 1752, were published at Edinburgh, where I then lived, my Political
Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on the first
publication.  HUME-1776-2,7.79

It was well received abroad and at home.  HUME-1776-2,7.80

In the same year was published at London, my Enquiry concerning the
Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion <paren> who ought not
to judge on that subject <$$paren>, is of all my writings, historical,
philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.  HUME-1776-2,7.81

It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world.  HUME-1776-2,7.82

In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office
from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the
command of a large library.  HUME-1776-2,7.83

I then formed the plan of writing the History of England; HUME-1776-2,7.84

but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through
a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the accession of the House
of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the misrepresentations of faction
began chiefly to take place.  HUME-1776-2,7.85

I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work.
HUME-1776-2,7.86

I thought that I was the only historian, that <P_8> had at once neglected
present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices;
HUME-1776-2,8.87

and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional
applause.  HUME-1776-2,8.88

But miserable was my disappointment: HUME-1776-2,8.89

I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even
detestation; HUME-1776-2,8.90

English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig, and Tory, churchman and sectary ,
freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage
against the man, who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate
of Charles I. and the Earl of Strafford; HUME-1776-2,8.91

and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still
more moritifying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion.  HUME-1776-2,8.92

Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five
copies of it.  HUME-1776-2,8.93

I scarcely, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, considerable
for rank or letters, that could indure the book.  HUME-1776-2,8.94

I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the
primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions.
HUME-1776-2,8.95

These dignified prelates seprately sent me message not to be discouraged.
HUME-1776-2,8.96

I was, however, I confess, discouraged; HUME-1776-2,8.97

and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and
England, I had certainly retired to some provincial town of the former
kingdom, have {COM:sic} changed my name, and never more have {COM:sic}
returned <P_9> to my native country.  HUME-1776-2,9.98

But as this scheme was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was
considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to persevere.
HUME-1776-2,9.99

In this interval, I published at London my Natural History of Religion,
along with some other small pieces: HUME-1776-2,9.100

its public entry was rather obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd
wrote a pamphlet against it, with the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and
scurrility, which distinguish the Warburtonian school.  HUME-1776-2,9.101

This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent
reception of my performance.  HUME-1776-2,9.102

In 1756, two years, after the fall of the first volume, was published
the second volume of my History, containing the period from the death
of Charles I. till the Revolution.  HUME-1776-2,9.103

This performance happened to give less displeasure to the Whigs,
HUME-1776-2,9.104

and was better received.  HUME-1776-2,9.105

It not only rose itself, HUME-1776-2,9.106

but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.  HUME-1776-2,9.107

But though I had been taught by experience that the Whig party were in
possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in literature ,
I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in
above a hundred alterations, which farther <P_10> study, reading, or
reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts,
I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side.  HUME-1776-2,10.108

It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period
as a regular plan of liberty.  HUME-1776-2,10.109

In 1759, I published my History of the House of Tudor.  HUME-1776-2,10.110

The clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against
the History of the two first Stuarts.  HUME-1776-2,10.111

The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious.  HUME-1776-2,10.112

But I was now callous against the impressions of public folly,
HUME-1776-2,10.113

and continued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at Edinburgh,
to finish, in two volumes, the more early part of the English History,
which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable
success.  HUME-1776-2,10.114

But, notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons, to which my
writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances,
that the copy-money given me by the booksellers, much exceeded any thing
formerly known in England; HUME-1776-2,10.115

I was become not only independent, but opulent.  HUME-1776-2,10.116

I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to
set my foot out of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never having
preferred a request to one great man, or even <P_11> making advances of
friendship to any of them.  HUME-1776-2,11.117

As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life
in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation
from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least acquainted,
to attend him on his embassy to Paris, with a near prospect of being
appointed secretary to the embassy, and, in the meanwhile, of performing
the functions of that office.  HUME-1776-2,11.118

This offer, however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was
reluctant to begin connexions with the great, and because I was afraid
that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove disagreeable
to a person of my age and humour: HUME-1776-2,11.119

but on his lordship's repeating the invitation, I accepted of it.
HUME-1776-2,11.120

I have every reason, both of pleasure and interest, to think myself
happy in my connexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with
his brother, General Conway.  HUME-1776-2,11.121

Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will never imagine
the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks
and stations.  HUME-1776-2,11.122

The more I resiled from their excessive civilities, the more I was loaded
with them.  HUME-1776-2,11.123

There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the
great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which <P_12>
that city abounds above all places in the universe.  HUME-1776-2,12.124

I thought once of settling there for life.  HUME-1776-2,12.125

I was appointed secretary to the embassy; HUME-1776-2,12.126

and in summer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being appointed Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland.  HUME-1776-2,12.127

I was <font> charg'e d'affaires <$$font> till the arrival of the Duke
of Richmond, towards the end of the year.  HUME-1776-2,12.128

In the beginning of $1766 {TEXT:1776}, I left Paris, HUME-1776-2,12.129

and next summer went to Edinburgh, with the same view as formerly,
of burying myself in a philosophical retreat.  HUME-1776-2,12.130

I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more money, and a
much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's friendship, than I left
it; HUME-1776-2,12.131

and I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce, as I had
formerly made an experiment of a competency.  HUME-1776-2,12.132

But in 1767, I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be
Under-secretary; HUME-1776-2,12.133

and this invitation, both the character of the person, and my connexions
with Lord Hertford, prevented me from declining.  HUME-1776-2,12.134

I returned to Edinburgh in 1769, very opulent <paren> for I possessed
a revenue of 1000 l. a year <$$paren>, healthy, and, though
somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease,
and of seeing the increase of my reputation.  HUME-1776-2,12.135

In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at first
gave me <P_13> no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal
and incurable.  HUME-1776-2,13.136

I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution.  HUME-1776-2,13.137

I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; HUME-1776-2,13.138

and what is more strange, have, notwithstanding the great decline of my
person, never suffered a moment's abatement of my spirits; insomuch,
that were I to name the period of my life, which I should most choose
to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period.
HUME-1776-2,13.139

I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in
company.  HUME-1776-2,13.140

I consider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only
a few years of infirmities; HUME-1776-2,13.141

and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out
at last with additional luster, I knew that I could have but few years
to enjoy it.  HUME-1776-2,13.142

It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present.
HUME-1776-2,13.143

To conclude historically with my character, I am, or rather was <paren>
for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which
emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments <$$paren>; I was, I say,
a man of mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social,
and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of
enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions.  HUME-1776-2,13.144

Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never <P_14> soured my
temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments.  HUME-1776-2,14.145

My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as
to the studious and literary; HUME-1776-2,14.146

and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I
had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them.
HUME-1776-2,14.147

In a word, though most men any wise eminent, have found reason to complain
of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth:
HUME-1776-2,14.148

and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and
religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their
wonted fury.  HUME-1776-2,14.149

My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my
character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well suppose,
would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage
, HUME-1776-2,14.150

but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face
of probability.  HUME-1776-2,14.151

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say there is no vanity in making this funeral
oration of myself, HUME-1776-2,14.152

but I hope it is not a misplaced one; HUME-1776-2,14.153

and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.
HUME-1776-2,14.154

April 18, 1776.  HUME-1776-2,14.155
