<P_209>

<font> Tuesday, May <$$font> the 20th, OFFICER-1744-1,209.2

This Evening myself, the Carpenter, and Cooper, went on Board the
St. <font> Tubes <$$font>, one of the <font> Brazil <$$font>
Ships, carrying twenty-eight Guns, <font> Theophilus Orego Ferrara
<$$font> Commander, bound for <font> Bahia <$$font> and <font> Lisbon.
<$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,209.3

The People left on Shore were, <font> John Jones <$$font>, Master's
Mate <font> John Snow <$$font>, ditto <font> Vincent Oakley <$$font>,
Surgeon <font> John King <$$font>, Boatswain <font> Samuel Stook <$$font>
, Seaman <font> John Shoreham <$$font>, ditto <font> John Pitman <$$font>
, ditto <font> Job Barns <$$font>, ditto <font> Richard East <$$font>
, ditto <font> Richard Powell <$$font>, ditto OFFICER-1744-1,209.4

<font> Wednesday <$$font> the 21st, OFFICER-1744-1,209.5

Early this Morning the Captain came on board; OFFICER-1744-1,209.6

on seeing us, he <P_210> ask'd us, How we came on board without his Leave?
OFFICER-1744-1,210.7

Notwithstanding he gave Leave to the Consul for our Passage, we ought
to have waited on him ashore.  OFFICER-1744-1,210.8

There was on board the Ship a <font> Spanish <$$font> Don, a passenger
, who told the Captain no <font> Englishman <$$font> should go in
the same Ship with him; therefore desired we might be turn'd ashore;
OFFICER-1744-1,210.9

but the Captain insisted upon doing what he pleas'd aboard his own Ship
, OFFICER-1744-1,210.10

and would not comply with his Request.  OFFICER-1744-1,210.11

The <font> Spanish <$$font> Don, when we came to converse with
him, was very much mov'd with the Relation of our Misfortunes;
OFFICER-1744-1,210.12

and said to us, though our Royal Masters, the Kings of <font> England
<$$font> and <font> Spain <$$font>, are at War, it was not our Fault ;
that we were now on board a neutral Ship belonging to a King who was
a Friend to both Nations; that he would not look upon us as Enemies,
but do us all the Service he could.  OFFICER-1744-1,210.13

He extoll'd the Conduct and Bravery of Admiral <font> Vernon <$$font>
at <font> Porto Bello <$$font>; OFFICER-1744-1,210.14

but, above all, applauded him for his Humanity and generous Treatment
of his Enemies.  OFFICER-1744-1,210.15

He made great Encomiums on the Magnificence of the <font> British
<$$font> Fleet, and the Boldness and Intrepidity of the Sailors, stiling
the <font> English <$$font> the <font> Soldiers of the Sea <$$font>.
OFFICER-1744-1,210.16

He supplied us in our Passage not only with Provisions from his Table,
but also with Wine and Brandy; OFFICER-1744-1,210.17

and during the whole Voyage appear'd so different from an Enemy, that he
took all Opportunities of giving us Proofs of his Generosity and Goodness.
OFFICER-1744-1,210.18

<font> Friday <$$font> the 7th of <font> May <$$font> 1742,
OFFICER-1744-1,210.19

This Morning <P_211> anchor'd before the City of <font> Bahia <$$font>
, OFFICER-1744-1,211.20

went on shore to the Vice-Roy, OFFICER-1744-1,211.21

shew'd him the Pass we had from the Governor of <font> Rio Janeiro
<$$font>; OFFICER-1744-1,211.22

He told us the Pass was to dispatch us to <font> Lisbon <$$font>, and
that the first Ship which sail'd from hence would be the Ship we came
in; OFFICER-1744-1,211.23

we petition'd him for Provisions, acquainting him of our Reception at
<font> Rio Grand <$$font>, and <font> Rio Janeiro <$$font>, that we
had hitherto been supply'd at the Rate of eight Vintins each Man <font>
per <$$font> Day.  OFFICER-1744-1,211.24

He refused supplying us with any Thing; upon which I told him, we had
better been Prisoners to the King of <font> Spain <$$font>, who would
allow us Bread and Water, than in a Friend's Country to be starv'd.
OFFICER-1744-1,211.25

The Captain of the Ship we came in, hearing the Vice-Roy would not
supply us, was so kind as to go with us to him, acquainting him how we
were provided for at <font> Rio Janeiro <$$font>, and that he would
supply us himself, if he would sign an Account to satisfy the Consul
General at <font> Lisbon <$$font>, so that he might be reimburs'd.
OFFICER-1744-1,211.26

The Vice-Roy answer'd, he had no Orders concerning the <font> English
<$$font>, that he had Letters from the King of <font> Portugal <$$font>
his Master to supply the <font> French <$$font>, but had no Orders about
any other Nation, and if he gave us any Thing, it must be out of his
own Pocket, OFFICER-1744-1,211.27

therefore he would not supply us: OFFICER-1744-1,211.28

The Captain then told him that we were Officers and Subjects to the King
of <font> England <$$font>, and in Distress; that we did not want great
Matters, only barely enough to support Life, OFFICER-1744-1,211.29

and begg'd that he would allow but four Vintins per Day, being but half
the Sum hitherto <P_212> allow'd us.  OFFICER-1744-1,212.30

The Captain's Intreaties avail'd nothing, the Vice-Roy continuing as
fix'd in his Resolution of giving us no Relief; OFFICER-1744-1,212.31

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} believe there ever was a worse Representative
of Royalty upon the Face of the Earth, than this Vice-Roy:
OFFICER-1744-1,212.32

His Royal Master the King of <font> Portugal <$$font> is very well
known to have a grateful Affection for the <font> British <$$font>
Nation OFFICER-1744-1,212.33

<paren> nor can we believe he is so Frenchify'd as this Vice-Roy makes
him <$$paren> OFFICER-1744-1,212.34

his Deputy differs greatly from him, OFFICER-1744-1,212.35

he has given a Proof of his Aversion to the <font> English.  <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,212.36

We think Persons in the Distress we were represented in to him, could
in no Part of the World, nay in an Enemy's Country, be treated with more
Barbarity than we were here; OFFICER-1744-1,212.37

we work'd here for our Victuals, OFFICER-1744-1,212.38

and then could get but one Meal <font> per <$$font> Day, which was Farina
and Caravances.  OFFICER-1744-1,212.39

Since our being here, we have been informed of one of his Majesty's Ships
with three Store-ships being arrived at <font> Rio Janeiro <$$font>,
supplied with Stores and Men for the Relief and Assistance of the <font>
Severn <$$font> and <font> Pearl <$$font>, <paren> which were sail'd
before in <font> January <$$font> last for <font> Barbadoes <$$paren>
<$$font> {COM:sic} and that our People were gone on board of them,
and bound for the <font> West Indies.  <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,212.40

Here is a very good Bay for Ships to ride in, with the Wind from
the E.S.E.  to the Northward and Westward back to the S.W.  and Wind
to the Southward, which blows in, and makes a very great Sea.
OFFICER-1744-1,212.41

At the East Side coming in, standeth <font> Point de Gloria <$$font>
, where is a very large Fortification with a Tower in the midst;
OFFICER-1744-1,212.42

from this Point the <P_213> Land rises gradually; OFFICER-1744-1,213.43

about a League from hence is the City of <font> Bahia <$$font>;
OFFICER-1744-1,213.44

it is surrounded with Fortifications, and equally capable of defending
it against any Attempts from the Sea or Land.  OFFICER-1744-1,213.45

Provisions here of all kinds are excessive dear, especially Fish,
OFFICER-1744-1,213.46

this we impute to the great Number of Whales that come into this Bay,
even where the Ships lye at Anchor; OFFICER-1744-1,213.47

the Whale Boats go off OFFICER-1744-1,213.48

and kill sometimes seven or eight Whales in a Day.  The Flesh of which
is cut up in small Pieces, then brought to the Market-place, and sold
at the Rate of a Vintin <font> per <$$font> Pound; OFFICER-1744-1,213.49

it looks very much like coarse Beef, but inferior to it in Taste.
OFFICER-1744-1,213.50

The Whales here are not all equal in Size to the Whales in
<font> Greenland <$$font>, being not larger than the Grampus.
OFFICER-1744-1,213.51

After living here above four Months without any Relief from the Governor
or the Inhabitants, who behaved to us as if they were under a Combination
to starve us, we embark'd on Board the St. <font> Tubes <$$font>
with our good Friend the Captain who brought us from <font> Rio Janeiro
<$$font>; OFFICER-1744-1,213.52

we sail'd from <font> Bahia <$$font> the 11th of <font> September <$$font>
for <font> Lisbon <$$font>, in Company with one of the King of <font>
Portugal <$$font>'s Ships of War, and two <font> East-India <$$font>
Ships; OFFICER-1744-1,213.53

but the St. <font> Tubes <$$font> not being able to sail
so well as the other Ships, lost Sight of them the first Night.
OFFICER-1744-1,213.54

About 70 Leagues from the Westward of <font> Madeira <$$font>, we bent
a new Foresail; OFFICER-1744-1,213.55

within two or three Days afterwards we had a very hard Gale of Wind,
scudding under the Foresail, and no Danger happening <P_214> to the Ship
during this Gale.  OFFICER-1744-1,214.56

When the Wind had ceas'd, and we had fair Weather, the Captain, after
the Evening Mass, made an Oration to the People, telling them that their
Deliverance from Danger in the last Gale of Wind, and that the Ship
though leaky making no more Water than before, was owing to their Prayers
to <font> Nuestra Senhora Boa Mortua <$$font> and her Intercession.
That in Gratitude they ought to make an Acnowlegment {COM:sic} to that
Saint for standing their Friend in time of Need.  That he himself would
shew an Example by giving the new Foresail, which was bent to the Yard,
to the Saint their Deliverer; OFFICER-1744-1,214.57

accordingly one of the Seamen went forward OFFICER-1744-1,214.58

and mark'd out these Words on the Sail, <font> Deal esta Trinckado
pour nostra Senhora Boa mortua <$$font> <paren> which is as much as to
say <$$paren> <font> I give this Foresail to our Saint the Deliverer
from Death.  <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,214.59

The Sail and Money collected on this Occasion amounted to upwards of
twenty Moydores.  OFFICER-1744-1,214.60

On <font> Monday <$$font> the 23d of <font> November <$$font>, in the
Latitude 39: 17: North, and Longitude 6: 00 W. that Day at Noon
the Rock of <font> Lisbon <$$font> bearing S. by W. distant
sixteen Leag. we steer'd E.S.E.  to make the Rock before Night.
OFFICER-1744-1,214.61

At four o'Clock it blew a very hard Gale, and right on the Shore;
OFFICER-1744-1,214.62

the Ship lay to under a Foresail with her Head to the Southward;
OFFICER-1744-1,214.63

at Six it blew a Storm, OFFICER-1744-1,214.64

the Foresail splitting, oblig'd us to keep her before the Wind, which
was running her right on the Shore.  OFFICER-1744-1,214.65

The Ship was now given over for lost, OFFICER-1744-1,214.66

the People all fell to Prayers, OFFICER-1744-1,214.67

and cried out to <P_215> their Saints For Deliverance, offering all they
had in the World for their Lives; OFFICER-1744-1,215.68

and yet at the same time neglected all Means to save themselves;
OFFICER-1744-1,215.69

they left off pumping the Ship, though she was exceeding leaky.
OFFICER-1744-1,215.70

This Sort of Proceeding in time of Extremity is a thing unknown to our
<font> English <$$font> Seamen; OFFICER-1744-1,215.71

in those Emergencies all Hands are employ'd for the Preservation of the
Ship and People, OFFICER-1744-1,215.72

and, if any of them fall upon their Knees, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} after
the Danger is over.  OFFICER-1744-1,215.73

The Carpenter and myself could by no Means relish this Behaviour,
OFFICER-1744-1,215.74

we begg'd the People for God's sake to go to the Pumps, telling them we
had a Chance to save our Lives, while we kept the Ship above Water, that
we ought not to suffer the Ship to sink, while we could keep her free.
OFFICER-1744-1,215.75

The Captain and Officers hearing us pressing them so earnestly, left
off Prayers, OFFICER-1744-1,215.76

and intreated the Men to keep the Pumps going, OFFICER-1744-1,215.77

accordingly we went to pumping, OFFICER-1744-1,215.78

and preserved ourselves and the Ship: OFFICER-1744-1,215.79

In half an Hour afterwards the Wind shifted to the W.N.W.
OFFICER-1744-1,215.80

then the Ship lay South, which would clear the Course along Shore;
OFFICER-1744-1,215.81

had the Wind not shifted, we must in an Hour's time have run the Ship
ashore.  OFFICER-1744-1,215.82

This Deliverance, as well as the former, was owing to the Intercession
of <font> Nuestra Senhora Boa Mortua: <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,215.83

On this Occasion they collected fifty Moydores more, OFFICER-1744-1,215.84

and made this pious Resolution, that, when the Ship arrived safe at <font>
Lisbon <$$font>, the Foresail, which was split in the last Gale of Wind,
should be carried in Procession to the Church of this grand Saint, and the
Captain should make an Offering equal in <P_216> Value to the Foresail,
which was reckoned worth eighteen Moydores.  OFFICER-1744-1,216.85

On <font> Saturday <$$font> the 28th of <font> November <$$font>, we
arrived at <font> Lisbon <$$font>; OFFICER-1744-1,216.86

and on the next Morning every Person who came in the Ship, <paren>
excepting the Carpenter, myself and the Cooper <$$paren> Officers,
Passengers, the <font> Spanish <$$font> Don himself, and all the People ,
Men and Boys, walked bare-footed, with the $Foresail {TEXT:Fore_sail} in
Procession, to the Church of <font> Neustra Senhora Boa Mortua <$$font>
the Weather at that Time being very cold, and the Church a good Mile
distant from the Landing-place.  OFFICER-1744-1,216.87

We <font> Englishmen <$$font>, when we came ashore, went immediately on
the <font> Change.  <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,216.88

I was pretty well known to some Gentlemen of the <font> English <$$font>
Factory.  OFFICER-1744-1,216.89

When I informed them that we were three of the unfortunate People that
were cast away in the <font> Wager <$$font>, and that we came here in
one of the <font> Brazil <$$font> Ships, and wanted to embrace the first
Opportunity of going for <font> England <$$font>; they told me, that the
Lieutenant had been before us; that he was gone home in the Packet-Boat,
and left us a very indifferent Character.  OFFICER-1744-1,216.90

Our Journal was read by several Gentlemen of the Factory, who treated
us, during our Stay at Lisbon, <font> <$$font> with exceeding Kindness
and Benevolence.  OFFICER-1744-1,216.91

On the 20th of <font> December <$$font>, we embarked on board his
Majesty's Ship the <font> Stirling Castle <$$font> for <font> England:
<$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,216.92

Here we had again the Happiness of experiencing the Difference between
a <font> British <$$font> and a foreign Ship, particularly in regard to
Cleanliness, Accommodation, Diet, and Discipline.  OFFICER-1744-1,216.93

We met with nothing material <P_217> in our Passage, OFFICER-1744-1,217.94

and arrived at <font> Spithead <$$font> on the 21st of <font> January
<$$font>, 1742-3.  OFFICER-1744-1,217.95

In about a Fortnight's Time, by an Order from the Right Hon. the
Lords of the Admiralty, we were put on Shore, the Captain of the <font>
Sterling Castle <$$font> not caring to land us till their Lordships
Pleasure should be known.  OFFICER-1744-1,217.96

We were to undergo an Examination before the whole Board,
OFFICER-1744-1,217.97

but their Lordships thinking it would be too tedious, appointed three
Gentlemen, Commanders of Ships, Persons of distinguish'd Merit and Honour,
to enquire into the Affair; OFFICER-1744-1,217.98

but it was afterwards order'd, that we should not be examin'd till the
Arrival of the Commodore or our Captain, OFFICER-1744-1,217.99

and it was also resolved, that not a Person of us should receive
any Wages, or be imploy'd in his Majesty's Service, till every Thing
relating to the <font> Wager <$$font> was more plain and conspicuous;
OFFICER-1744-1,217.100

There was no Favour shewn in this Respect more to one than the other,
so that every Body seem'd pleas'd with their Lordships Resolution.
OFFICER-1744-1,217.101

As to our Commander, Capt. <font> Cheap <$$font>, the Lords of
the Admiralty have receiv'd a Letter from him by the Way of <font> Lisbon
<$$font>, giving an Account that he was at a <font> Portuguese <$$font>
Settlement in <font> Chili <$$font>, where he had been well received by
the Governor, and was preparing to embark for <font> England <$$font>
the first Opportunity.  OFFICER-1744-1,217.102

Here ends the Account of the <font> Wager <$$font>, which I am well
assured is a very faithful one, free from any Impartiality or Prejudice,
either to the Captain, Officers, or Crew.  OFFICER-1744-1,217.103

As I have now finish'd this, I shall, according to my <P_218> Promise,
proceed with my Journal of the Commodore's Expedition, and begin where I
left off when we lost Sight of the <font> Wager <$$font>, being the 19th.

The <font> Gloucester <$$font>'s People informed us, that so great
a Number of Rats were seen between Decks, as would appear incredible
to any but an Eye Witness; that they were infested with them to that
prodigious Degree, that they could scarce keep them from running over
their Victuals, during the Time they were at Dinner, and that they had
never seen so great a Number before this Day.  OFFICER-1744-1,218.114

they likewise found the <font> Oakham <$$font>, wash'd out of the Whale
between Wind and Water; on which they nailed a Piece of Lead over the
Place that was leaky.  OFFICER-1744-1,218.120

The Ship's Company being still in a sick and <P_219> miserable Condition,
at eight in the Morning they brought to, OFFICER-1744-1,219.121

Fresh Gales and squally with Rain.  OFFICER-1744-1,220.180

<font> Friday <$$font>, 15.  OFFICER-1744-1,220.181

Fresh Gales and squally with much Rain.  OFFICER-1744-1,220.182

The Crew of the <font> Gloucester <$$font> are extreamly sickly, they
having very few capable of working the Ship; OFFICER-1744-1,220.183

and what still adds to their unfortunate Condition is, the prodigious
Increase of Rats, which plague them to that degree, that they can get
no sleep; OFFICER-1744-1,220.184

for they are no sooner laid down in their Hammocks, but immediately a
Swarm of these Vermin come running over them, and frequently <P_221>
give them sad Bites; OFFICER-1744-1,221.185

nay, some of those who kept their Hammocks, and thro'the Force of their
Distemper, almost insensible of Pain, have had part of their Toes eat
off as they lay there; OFFICER-1744-1,221.186

the Destruction and Deformity which these Vermin do make on the dead
Bodies, that lye about the Deck, <paren> they having at this Time, ten or
a dozen dying in a Day <$$paren> makes the most shocking Spectacle that
ever Man beheld, one having his Eyes eat out, another his Cheeks eaten
off, and others part of their Arms, Legs, <font> &c. <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,221.187

<font> Saturday <$$font> 16.  OFFICER-1744-1,221.188

Fresh Gales and hazey, OFFICER-1744-1,221.189

the latter moderate and cloudy with Rain.  OFFICER-1744-1,221.190

This Day we saw the Land, OFFICER-1744-1,221.191

bore E.N.E.  10 Leagues distant; OFFICER-1744-1,221.192

we imagined, according to our Reckoning, this to be the high Land of
the Island <font> Socora.  <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,221.193

At three in the Morning it blowed so violently, that we lowered the
Mainyard, and took the third Reef in the Sails.  OFFICER-1744-1,221.194

At six in the Morning we saw the Northmost Land E. by N.
and the Southernmost S.E.  half E. OFFICER-1744-1,221.195

the Land appeared like Islands of an indifferent Height,
OFFICER-1744-1,221.196

the Northernmost we took to be <font> Narborough <$$font>'s
Island.  {COM:sic} bearing then E. by N. 8 Leagues.
OFFICER-1744-1,221.197

The Wind coming about, we wore Ship, OFFICER-1744-1,221.198

and stood to the Eastward, after a Consultation being held on Board;
OFFICER-1744-1,221.199

it was apprehended not safe to steer near the Shore, the Ship's Company
being so very weak and ill, that they were not capable of working the
Ship; OFFICER-1744-1,221.200

therefore we were resolved to <P_222> make the best of our Way to
the Island of <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font>, <paren> the Place
appointed for a general Rendevouz {COM:sic} <$$paren> in order to
recover and refresh our Men, and refit our Sails and Rigging, which
were in a wretched Condition, our Shrouds and Chain-plates being broke;
OFFICER-1744-1,222.201

nay, so great was the Sickness among the Men, and they rendered so
incapable thereby of performing their proper Duty, or working the Ship
, that even the Officers in the Ship were obliged to keep the Watch.
OFFICER-1744-1,222.202

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 17.  OFFICER-1744-1,222.203

We had hard Gales with violent squalms of Wind.  OFFICER-1744-1,222.204

At 2 in the Morning the Forestay blew from the Stay,
OFFICER-1744-1,222.205

and the violent Weather obliged us to bear away.  OFFICER-1744-1,222.206

Our Foresail split to pieces, OFFICER-1744-1,222.207

and in order to reef our other Sails, we brought to under a balanced
Mizen.  OFFICER-1744-1,222.208

At 3 in the Morning we bent another Foresail OFFICER-1744-1,222.209

and set it; OFFICER-1744-1,222.210

we were upwards of two Hours hawling the Mainyard up by the Captain,
our Men being so very weak.  OFFICER-1744-1,222.211

At Noon we saw several high cragged Mountains covered with Snow,
OFFICER-1744-1,222.212

the last appeared from the Northwest to the Southeast.
OFFICER-1744-1,222.213

We found daily a great deal of Water in our Ballast, which occasioned
us a great deal of Trouble and Time to be spent to come at the fresh
Water for the Ship's Company, out of the little Stock of that precious
Commodity we had left; OFFICER-1744-1,222.214

and sometimes it was almost impossible, the Ship being very leaky when
it blows; OFFICER-1744-1,222.215

the Gunners Crew, the Carpenters Crew, the Boatswain and the Armourer
and their Crews all very ill.  OFFICER-1744-1,222.216

<P_223>

<font> Monday <$$font>, 18.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.218

The Weather in some Degree abated to moderate Gales, and sometimes
Squalls for the first Part, OFFICER-1744-1,223.219

the latter, little Wind and small Rain.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.220

At 10 saw the Land from N.W.  by W. to the S.S.E.  being very
high Mountains and covered with Snow, OFFICER-1744-1,223.221

and appeared like Islands.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.222

Little Wind and small Rain for the first Part, OFFICER-1744-1,223.224

N. by E. OFFICER-1744-1,223.226

Little Wind and hazey Weather, intermixed with Calms.
OFFICER-1744-1,223.228

At 8 in the Morning saw the Land E. by S. ten or twelve
Leagues distant.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.229

<font> Thursday <$$font>, 21.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.230

Little Wind, and calm for the most part of the twenty four Hours.
OFFICER-1744-1,223.231

This Day the <font> Gloucester <$$font> put their Ship's Company to a
Pint of Water <font> per <$$font> Day, except the Sick, who were allowed
a Quart.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.232

<font> Friday <$$font> 22.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.233

Little Wind and small Rain.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.234

At Noon the high Land of <font> Patagonia <$$font> in the Latitude of
48:00 bore E.S.E.  distant 20 Leagues, OFFICER-1744-1,223.235

and appeared to be very high craggy Land.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.236

A strong Current here set us to the Westward.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.237

<font> Saturday <$$font>, 23.  OFFICER-1744-1,223.238

We had little Wind and calm for the first part, the middle and latter hard
Gales and squally, with a very great Sea and a violent Swell, which did
a great deal of Damage to our Rigging and Sails; OFFICER-1744-1,223.239

we likewise shipped a very great Sea, the Ship being in a very deplorable
Condition for want of Sails, Yards and Water for the few Men that <P_224>
we had left.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.240

We had not one Topsailyard in the Ship, nor a Carpenter well to repair
any of them.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.241

To make a Shift with in our present Extremity, we bent a Spritsail for
a Foretopsail.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.242

We had likewise a great deal of Water in our Ballast,
OFFICER-1744-1,224.243

and our Men died prodigiously fast.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.244

The high Land of <font> Patagonia <$$font> bore distant 51 Leagues.
OFFICER-1744-1,224.245

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 24.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.246

Strong Gales and Squalls with some Rains and a great Sea.
OFFICER-1744-1,224.247

Our Men being extreamly ill we had not Hands to work the Ship.

Little Wind, inclining to calm.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.252

We employed the few Men we had in repairing our Rigging, and fixing it
on the proper Yards.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.253

<font> Thursday <$$font>, 28.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.254

Little Wind and calm.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.255

This proving a fine Day we got up every body that was capable of coming
upon the Deck, OFFICER-1744-1,224.256

and began at eight in the Morning repairing our Rigging.
OFFICER-1744-1,224.257

Little Wind and cloudy Weather with Rain.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.261

This Day we saved a Butt of the Rain Water for the Sick, which was
some small Refreshment for us in our great Necessity for Drink.
OFFICER-1744-1,224.262

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 31.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.263

Moderate Gales and fair Weather for the first part, OFFICER-1744-1,224.264

Our Men extremely ill, very few being able to work the Ship.

<font> Monday, June <$$font> 1.  OFFICER-1744-1,224.267

Moderate Gales and <P_225> cloudy Weather for the first part,
OFFICER-1744-1,225.268

the latter part little Wind and Rain, with a great Swell from the
Southward.  OFFICER-1744-1,225.269

This Day we were also glad to save a Puncheon of Water.
OFFICER-1744-1,225.270

the latter part little Wind and fair with a great Swell from the Southwest
; OFFICER-1744-1,225.275

our Men extreamly weak, OFFICER-1744-1,225.276

and no Relief but by getting to some Place where we might land them.

Moderate Gales and fair Weather for the first part, OFFICER-1744-1,225.290

the latter fresh Gales and cloudy.  OFFICER-1744-1,225.291

This Day at 4 in the Afternoon saw the island of <font> Juan
Fernandez <$$font>, distant about 13 Leagues W. by S.
OFFICER-1744-1,225.292

The Joy that appeared among our People at this Sight is inexpressible,
OFFICER-1744-1,225.293

for our Ship <paren> as well as Men <$$paren> was in a deplorable
Condition.  OFFICER-1744-1,225.294

<font> Tuesday <$$font>, 9.  OFFICER-1744-1,225.295

Fresh Gales and cloudy, with some showers of Rain, and a very great Sea.
OFFICER-1744-1,225.296

At Noon the Body of the Island <P_226> was distant about 4 Leagues.
OFFICER-1744-1,226.297

<font> Wednesday <$$font>, 10.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.298

The first part fresh Gales and cloudy with small Rains,
OFFICER-1744-1,226.299

the middle and latter parts little Wind and cloudy.
OFFICER-1744-1,226.300

At 2 in the Afternoon we anchor'd in 20 Fathom Water, under the Land,
at our $long-wish'd-for {TEXT:long_wish'd_for} Port <font> Juan Fernandez
<$$font>, OFFICER-1744-1,226.301

and at 4 moor'd.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.302

We were in a most deplorable Condition, not having 200 Men left out of
above 500 we brought from <font> England <$$font>, and most of those
scarce able to crawl along the Deck.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.303

As soon as we had moor'd, we sent our Boats ashore with Spars and Sails
to make Tents for the Sick.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.304

The Commodore assisted us in fixing them, OFFICER-1744-1,226.305

and cheer'd us with Necessaries from his own Stores.
OFFICER-1744-1,226.306

I take this Island to lie in Latitude 34: 45 and about 120 Leagues from
the Main.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.307

It is uninhabited.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.308

It is about twelve Leagues round, with small pleasant Vallies, which,
if manur'd, would probably bear Wheat, Peas, <font> &c. <$$font>
OFFICER-1744-1,226.309

The Sides of the Mountains are partly Woodlands, well stock'd with
Timber fit for building, but not for Masts; and partly Savannas, or
natural Meadows, which produce very fine Grass.  OFFICER-1744-1,226.310

There are but two Bays in the whole Island where Ships may anchor,
OFFICER-1744-1,226.311

and these are at the E. End, in both of which is a Rivulet of
fresh Water; OFFICER-1744-1,226.312

these Bays may be so fortified with little Charge, that fifty Men in each,
might be able to keep off a thousand; OFFICER-1744-1,226.313

and there $is no coming into these Bays from the W. End but with
great Difficulty, through narrow Passages over the Mountains, where if
three <P_227> Men were placed, they may keep off as many thousands from
approaching them.  OFFICER-1744-1,227.314

Here we found abundance of Goats, Dogs, Sea Lions, Seals, Bream, Cod,
and Crawfish as big as a middling Lobster; OFFICER-1744-1,227.315

we likewise found great Numbers of Roots much resembling our long sort
of Turneps, Cabbage-Trees, Water-Cresses, &c. which were of great
Service to us, and saved all our Lives.  OFFICER-1744-1,227.316

We at first catch'd very few Goats, not knowing how to come at them,
they taking Shelter upon the Mountains and amongst the Rocks for fear
of the Dogs; OFFICER-1744-1,227.317

but after a while, finding that they always came out towards Night to
graze, we used to way-lay them, OFFICER-1744-1,227.318

and shot a great many, which with the Dogs that we also shot made a
delicious Entertainment.  OFFICER-1744-1,227.319

The Sea Lions we kill'd chiefly for Harslets, which eat as fine as any
calf's pluck in the World; OFFICER-1744-1,227.320

sometimes indeed we used to cut their Flesh into Stakes, and broil it;
OFFICER-1744-1,227.321

it eats somewhat like a Beef-steak, OFFICER-1744-1,227.322

and is of the same Colour when dress'd.  OFFICER-1744-1,227.323

The Reason why they are so call'd, as we imagine, is from their roaring ,
which is very much like that of Land Lions, and in their Heads also much
resembling them; OFFICER-1744-1,227.324

they have four large Teeth <P_228> before, OFFICER-1744-1,228.325

the rest thick, short and stubbed; OFFICER-1744-1,228.326

their hind Parts are very different; OFFICER-1744-1,228.327

they are very large, some of them being near twice the Bigness of a
Horse; OFFICER-1744-1,228.328

they have four Fins; OFFICER-1744-1,228.329

the two foremost, which are about half a Yard long, serve them, when
ashore, to stump along, drawing their hinder Part after them, the two
hindermost being only of use to them in the Water; OFFICER-1744-1,228.330

they have short Hair of a light Colour, but lighter when young than old,
OFFICER-1744-1,228.331

for when old they look more sandy; OFFICER-1744-1,228.332

their Prey is all in the Water, their Food being Fish,
OFFICER-1744-1,228.333

but being of an amphibious Kind, they generally come upon the Land to
sleep; OFFICER-1744-1,228.334

five or six frequently come OFFICER-1744-1,228.335

and huddle together like Swine, OFFICER-1744-1,228.336

and lie so for two or three Days, if not molested; OFFICER-1744-1,228.337

they are very fat, OFFICER-1744-1,228.338

and produce a considerable Quantity of Oil, some of which we used in
our Lamps, and also in frying our Fish, it having no unpleasant Taste.
OFFICER-1744-1,228.339

They are very much afraid of a Man, OFFICER-1744-1,228.340

for as soon as they see him, or apprehend they are in Danger
from any thing near them, they immediately make to the Water,
OFFICER-1744-1,228.341

<paren> for they never venture very far from it.  <$$paren>
OFFICER-1744-1,228.342

Some of our People would frequently get on their Backs and ride them.
OFFICER-1744-1,228.343

If they are close pursued, they will frequently turn about and raise
their Body up with their Fore-fins, and face the Pursuer, standing with
their Mouths wide open upon their Guard.  OFFICER-1744-1,228.344

One of our People was unfortunately torn to Pieces by them.
OFFICER-1744-1,228.345

Our Method of killing them when we wanted them to eat, or their Oil,
was to clap a Pistol just to their Mouths as they stand <P_229> open,
and so fire it down their Throats; OFFICER-1744-1,229.346

but when we had a Mind to have some Diversion with them, which we call'd
<font> Lion bating <$$font>, then each of us took a Half pike in his
Hand, OFFICER-1744-1,229.347

and so prick'd them to Death, which commonly was sport for three or four
Hours before we kill'd them, OFFICER-1744-1,229.348

and oftentimes they would find us work enough; OFFICER-1744-1,229.349

but they being heavy unweildy Creatures, and we assaulting them
before and behind, and all round, generally conquer'd them in the end,
OFFICER-1744-1,229.350

yet they often would put us a little to the Scower, OFFICER-1744-1,229.351

and sometimes the Creature would run himself, OFFICER-1744-1,229.352

but knew not which way, OFFICER-1744-1,229.353

for we commonly got between the Water and him.  OFFICER-1744-1,229.354

We kill'd one which was almost twenty-four Foot long, fifteen round,
and seventeen Inches deep in Fat.  OFFICER-1744-1,229.355

As to Seals, we did not eat many of them, judging them to be unwholesome
; OFFICER-1744-1,229.356

they are almost as big as Calves; OFFICER-1744-1,229.357

under each Shoulder grows a long thick Fin; OFFICER-1744-1,229.358

these serve them to swim with when in the Sea, OFFICER-1744-1,229.359

and are instead of Legs to them, when on the Land; OFFICER-1744-1,229.360

for raising their Bodies up on end, by the Help of these Fins or Stumps,
and so having their Tail-parts drawn close under them, they rebound as
it were, OFFICER-1744-1,229.361

and throw their Bodies forward, drawing their hinder Parts after them;
OFFICER-1744-1,229.362

and then again rising up, and springing forward with their fore Parts
alternately, they lie tumbling thus up and down, all the while they are
moving on Land.  OFFICER-1744-1,229.363

From their $Shoulders {TEXT:Soulders} to their Tails they grow tapering
like Fish, OFFICER-1744-1,229.364

and have two small Fins on each side the Rump, which is <P_230> commonly
covered with their Fins: OFFICER-1744-1,230.365

These Fins serve instead of a Tail in the Sea; OFFICER-1744-1,230.366

and on Land they sit on them, when they give suck to their young.
OFFICER-1744-1,230.367

Their Hair is of divers Colours, as black, grey, dun, spotted,
looking very sleek and pleasant when they come first out of the Sea.
OFFICER-1744-1,230.368

Here are always Thousands either sitting on the Bays, or going and coming
in the Sea round the Island, which is covered with them <paren> as they
lie at the Top of the Water playing and sunning themselves <$$paren>
for near a Mile from the Shore.  OFFICER-1744-1,230.369

The young Seals are like Puppies, OFFICER-1744-1,230.370

and lie much ashore; OFFICER-1744-1,230.371

but when beaten by any of us, they, as well as the old ones, will make
towards the Sea, and swim very swift and nimble; tho'on Shore they lie
very sluggishly, OFFICER-1744-1,230.372

and will not go out of our ways unless we beat them, but snap at us.
OFFICER-1744-1,230.373

A Blow on the Nose soon kills them.  OFFICER-1744-1,230.374

The Bream we used to fry, OFFICER-1744-1,230.375

and are pretty good eating, only very bony; OFFICER-1744-1,230.376

they are about twenty Inches long, and from the top of their Backs to
the bottom of their Bellies eight Inches; OFFICER-1744-1,230.377

they have five large Fins on the hinder Part of their Heads, and
one large one, reaching from the hindermost of them to their Tails,
OFFICER-1744-1,230.378

they have two middling ones, one on each Side of their Gills, and one
large one stretching from the Middle of the Bottom of their Bellies to
their Tails, which is dented like a half Moon; OFFICER-1744-1,230.379

they have large Eyes, wide Nostrils, and a small Mouth;
OFFICER-1744-1,230.380

they are very thin, OFFICER-1744-1,230.381

and we called them Bream, because they nearest resembled that Sort
of Fish.  OFFICER-1744-1,230.382

The <P_231> Cod we catch'd as fast as we could bait our Hooks,
OFFICER-1744-1,231.383

and are very good eating; OFFICER-1744-1,231.384

we likewise dried great Number, OFFICER-1744-1,231.385

and put them on board our Ship; OFFICER-1744-1,231.386

they are about two Foot long, OFFICER-1744-1,231.387

and have small Scales about the Bigness of a Silver-penny;
OFFICER-1744-1,231.388

they weigh about twelve Pounds, OFFICER-1744-1,231.389

and are so very fat that they may be eaten boil'd or fry'd without Butter
or Oil.  OFFICER-1744-1,231.390

The Crawfish we made Broth of.  OFFICER-1744-1,231.391

The Turneps and Cabbage Trees were of great Use to us, especially
the latter, the Fruit of which, tho'small, was very good and sweet.
OFFICER-1744-1,231.392

The Body of the Tree is small and strait, and of a prodigious Length,
<paren> some Trees being 70 or 80 Foot long <$$paren> with several Knots
or Joints, about four Inches from each other, without any Leaves except
at the Top, in the midst of which the Cabbage is contained, which when
boiled is as good as any Garden Cabbage; OFFICER-1744-1,231.393

the Branches are commonly about twelve or thirteen Feet in
length , and about a Foot and an half from the Trunk of the Tree;
OFFICER-1744-1,231.394

they shoot forth Leaves about four Foot long and an Inch and an half
broad, which grow so regularly, that the whole Branch seems but one
entire Leaf; OFFICER-1744-1,231.395

the Cabbage when cut out from amongst the Bottoms of the Branches, is
commonly about six Inches round, and a Foot long, OFFICER-1744-1,231.396

and is as white as Milk.  OFFICER-1744-1,231.397

At the Bottom of the Cabbage grow great Bunches of Berries, in Shape like
a Bunch of Grapes, and about six Pounds weight, OFFICER-1744-1,231.398

they are red, and about the Bigness of a large Cherry, with a large
Stone in the Middle, OFFICER-1744-1,231.399

<P_232>

and taste like <font> English <$$font> Haws.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.401

The Method we used in getting the Cabbages, was not by climbing the Trees,
because they are so high, and have not any thing in the Bodies to hold
by, but by cutting them down.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.402

There is a Sort of Fowl here, who are of a grey Colour, and about the
Bigness of a small Pullet, that work Boroughs in the Ground like a Coney,
and lodge in them in the Night, and go out to catch Fish in the Day Time,
OFFICER-1744-1,232.403

for they are of a quadruped kind, OFFICER-1744-1,232.404

and eat a little fishy OFFICER-1744-1,232.405

but after having been properly cooked they taste tolerable well.
OFFICER-1744-1,232.406

There are also some <font> Penguins <$$font>, and a little Bird a
considerable deal smaller than a Wren, that hath a Bill no bigger than
a common Pin, OFFICER-1744-1,232.407

his Legs are but small in Proportion to his Bulk; OFFICER-1744-1,232.408

his Feathers are very small, and mostly black; OFFICER-1744-1,232.409

we seldom saw any of them unless towards Evening, OFFICER-1744-1,232.410

and then they would come humming about us: OFFICER-1744-1,232.411

But if we had a Fire in the Night, before the Morning we should have a
considerable Number of them fly into it.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.412

<font> Thursday <$$font>, 11.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.413

The first and middle Parts little Wind and Calm, OFFICER-1744-1,232.414

the latter moderate and clear.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.415

This Day arrived here the <font> Tryal <$$font>, in a most miserable
shatter'd Condition; having buried above half her Crew since she left
<font> England.  <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,232.416

We sent them some Fish and Water, with a Fore Quarter of a Dog.
OFFICER-1744-1,232.417

<font> Friday <$$font>, 12.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.418

Moderate Gales and Cloudy.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.419

Employ'd in $overhauling {TEXT:over_hauling} our Rigging.
OFFICER-1744-1,232.420

<font> Saturday <$$font>, 13.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.421

employ'd as before.  OFFICER-1744-1,232.423

<P_233>

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 14.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.425

Moderate Weather.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.426

We now begin to find a great Alteration in our sick People, they beginning
to recover, which we impute to their eating Fish and Greens in great
Plenty; those who have any Appetite, recovering in a short time, but
those who have none dying, their Disorder having gain'd too much Ground
upon them.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.427

We observed that the Scurvy had very different Effects on us;
OFFICER-1744-1,233.428

some were taken with a Shortness of Breath, OFFICER-1744-1,233.429

these were soon carried off; OFFICER-1744-1,233.430

some quite lost their Senses.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.431

In some it got into their Brains, OFFICER-1744-1,233.432

and they ran raving mad; OFFICER-1744-1,233.433

others had their Sinews so contracted, that they lost the Use of their
Limbs.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.434

Our Surgeon opened several that died, OFFICER-1744-1,233.435

and found their Blood all dried up and their Vessels full of Water,
OFFICER-1744-1,233.436

and their Bones, after the Flesh was scrapped off, appeared quite black.
OFFICER-1744-1,233.437

From this Time to the 27th, nothing remarkable happened.
OFFICER-1744-1,233.438

<font> Saturday <$$font>, 27.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.439

The Weather being very Fair, we saw a Sail, which proved to be the <font>
Gloucester <$$font>; on which the Commodore order'd the Cutter on Board,
with the first Lieutenant, who carried with him some Fish and Water,
which was very acceptable, they being for some Time past at the Allowance
of only a Pint a Day; OFFICER-1744-1,233.440

and their People being in so weakly a Condition, the Captain was
obliged to detain our Lieutenant and Crew to help to work the Ship.
OFFICER-1744-1,233.441

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 28, OFFICER-1744-1,233.442

The Wind variable with fair Weather.  OFFICER-1744-1,233.443

At one in the Morning we sent the <font> Tryal <$$font>'s Boat off to
the <font> Gloucester <$$font> with a <P_234> Lieutenant, together with
some Provisions and Water.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.444

The Captain of the <font> Gloucester <$$font>, detained the Boat and
Men to help to work the Ship.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.445

At six in the Morning she was distant from the North End of the Island
about 4 Leagues.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.446

<font> Monday <$$font>, 29.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.447

At one in the Afternoon the <font> Gloucester <$$font> fired a Gun,
OFFICER-1744-1,234.454

and sent our first Lieutenant in the Cutter ashore, to acquaint the
Commodore in what Condition the Ship was.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.455

She was still about six Leagues distant.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.456

distant seven Miles, fired two Guns, at which we sent our Boat on Board,
with some fresh Water and Fish, with a Letter from the Commodore;
OFFICER-1744-1,234.461

as soon as our Boat arrived, the Ship's Crew hoisted out their Cutter,
OFFICER-1744-1,234.462

and sent her a-head with our Boat to tow her.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.463

<font> Saturday <$$font> 4.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.464

Calm and fine Weather.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.465

At four in the Afternoon we sent our Second Lieutenant with several Men
off to assist them in towing her, OFFICER-1744-1,234.466

but they finding her to drive and not go a-head, they sent our Lieutenant
in our Cutter to desire more Assistance.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.467

They were distant about three Leagues.  OFFICER-1744-1,234.468

<P_235>

From <font> Sunday <$$font> the 5th to the 10th, we met with nothing
worthy of Observation.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.470

Nothing remarkable happen'd ashore, OFFICER-1744-1,235.476

we chiefly were employ'd in fitting our Ships for the Sea.

Our Men recover their Strength very fast.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.478

Moderate and cloudy the first and latter Parts, OFFICER-1744-1,235.480

the Middle squally.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.481

At eight in the Morning we saw her again about four Leagues distant,
OFFICER-1744-1,235.482

and soon after she fir'd two Guns, OFFICER-1744-1,235.483

and made a Signal of Distress, she having at that Time, as
we were afterwards informed, but one Puncheon of Water left.
OFFICER-1744-1,235.484

<font> Friday <$$font> 17.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.485

Fresh Gales and squally.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.486

At eleven at Night we sent our Boat on Board her with two Hogsheads of
Wine, and nine Puncheons of Water, and some Fish.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.487

At nine our Boat returned, OFFICER-1744-1,235.488

and brought six of her sick Men in her.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.489

<font> Saturday <$$font>, 18.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.490

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 19.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.493

Moderate Gales and cloudy Weather.  OFFICER-1744-1,235.494

This Day we lost Sight of her again, OFFICER-1744-1,235.495

and did not see her for three Days afterwards, during which Time,
as they informed us, she was driven to a little Island call'd <font>
Massafurro <$$font>, that lies in Latitude 35: 55 S. and about
25 Leagues S.S.W.  from <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font>, where <P_236>
they sent their Cutter ashore for Water; OFFICER-1744-1,236.496

but she returned without being able to get at any, tho'they saw several
Streams; the Wind blowing so strong on the Shore as caused a great Surff
{COM:sic} that hinder'd their landing; OFFICER-1744-1,236.497

however they brought the Boat full of Fish.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.498

<font> Thursday <$$font>, 23.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.499

Little Winds and cloudy.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.500

At 8 in the Morning we saw the <font> Gloucester <$$font> again,
OFFICER-1744-1,236.501

and at 11 she came to an Anchor.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.502

The Commodore sent our Boat with the second Lieutenant to assist her in
mooring, her Crew not being able to do it, all their Men being sick but
three or four, and a few Boys.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.503

They had been ever since the 20th of <font> June <$$font> attempting to
make the $Land {TEXT:Lnd}, OFFICER-1744-1,236.504

but the Squalls that blew from the Shore prevented them, though they
were sometimes within less than a Mile of it.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.505

The Mortality on board this Ship raged more than in any other,
OFFICER-1744-1,236.506

for since they left St. <font> Julian <$$font>'s, which
was the 27th of <font> April <$$font>, they had buried 254 Men,
OFFICER-1744-1,236.507

and had but 98 Men and Boys now living, and most of them in a miserable
Condition.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.508

When they first made the Island they had not Water to supply them for a
Week longer, at the Rate of a Pint a Day, which they had been reduced to
ever since the 21st of <font> May; <$$font> so that had they not reached
the Island they must have inevitably perished.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.509

<font> Friday <$$font>, 24.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.510

Little Wind and moderate Weather.  OFFICER-1744-1,236.511

OFFICER-1744-1,236.514

<P_237>

<font> Saturday <$$font>, 25.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.516

OFFICER-1744-1,237.517

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 26.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.518

This Day we sent Hands on Board the <font> Gloucester <$$font> to assist
in getting the Sheet Anchor off the Gunnel.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.519

Nothing remarkable happened till the 5th of <font> August <$$font>; we
being still employed in repairing our Ships and Rigging, and getting on
Board Water and other Necessaries.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.520

<font> Wednesday, August <$$font> 5.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.521

Little Wind and cloudy Weather.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.522

At 5 in the Evening the <font> Tryal <$$font> <paren> being now ready
to put to Sea and her Men pretty well recovered <$$paren> sail'd by
Order from the Commodore for the Island of <font> Massafurro <$$font> ,
to see if the other Ships, which we had parted with, were arrived there;
OFFICER-1744-1,237.523

but in about half an Hour after she put out, she made a Signal of
Distress, on which we sent our Boats off to assist her, she being driven
with a strong Current, and the Wind blowing towards Land, almost on a
Rock; OFFICER-1744-1,237.524

accordingly they took her in tow, OFFICER-1744-1,237.525

and at 10 she anchored by us.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.526

<font> Thursday <$$font>, 6.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.527

This Day early in the Morning the <font> Tryal <$$font> sailed again
for the said Island.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.528

<font> Friday <$$font>, 7.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.529

This Day the <font> Gloucester <$$font>'s People in clearing the Hold,
in order to fill the Ground Tier with Water, found several Butts half
filled with salt Water and Ballast, occasioned by the Rats eating holes
in them.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.530

Nothing remarkable till the 17th.  OFFICER-1744-1,237.531

Squadron, OFFICER-1744-1,238.539

but could get no Intelligence of them; OFFICER-1744-1,238.540

nothing remarkable to the 7th of <font> September <$$font>.
OFFICER-1744-1,238.541

<font> Sunday <$$font>, <font> September <$$font> 7.
OFFICER-1744-1,238.542

At eight this Morning we saw a Sail in the Offing, OFFICER-1744-1,238.543

we had then our Top-masts stuck, OFFICER-1744-1,238.544

but immediately hoisted them, OFFICER-1744-1,238.545

bent our Sails, OFFICER-1744-1,238.546

and slipt our Cables, leaving Orders for the <font> Tryal <$$font>
to take Care and weigh them, OFFICER-1744-1,238.547

and gave her Chace; OFFICER-1744-1,238.548

on the next Day we lost Sight of her, OFFICER-1744-1,238.549

but in a little Time after we saw another Sail, OFFICER-1744-1,238.550

and gave her Chace, OFFICER-1744-1,238.551

and came up with her OFFICER-1744-1,238.552

and took her; OFFICER-1744-1,238.553

we brought her back to <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font>, where we arrived
on the Fourteenth.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.554

When we came in we fired a Gun, which the <font> Gloucester <$$font>
answered.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.555

The Capture was a <font> Spanish <$$font> Merchant ship call'd the <font>
Camella <$$font>, OFFICER-1744-1,238.556

and had on board between 30 and 40,000 <font> l. <$$font> in Money,
a large Quantity of Loaf-Sugar, several Bales of Linnen, and some Snuff.
OFFICER-1744-1,238.557

<font> Thursday <$$font>, 17.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.558

We sent eight of the <font> Anne <$$font> {COM:sic} Pink's Guns on board
of the Prize and part of her Shot.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.559

<font> Friday <$$font>, 18.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.560

This Day the <font> Tryal <$$font>, having got in her Water and other
Necessaries, sail'd by Order to cruize in a certain Latitude, and there
to wait for our Arrival.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.561

<font> Saturday <$$font>, 19.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.562

We put twenty eight <font> Spanish <$$font> Prisoners from on board our
Ship into the <font> Gloucester <$$font>.  OFFICER-1744-1,238.563

<P_239>

<font> Sunday <$$font>, 20.  OFFICER-1744-1,239.565

After leaving Orders for the <font> Gloucester <$$font> as soon as she was
$refitted {TEXT:re_fitted} to follow us, and likewise for destroying the
<font> Anne <$$font> {COM:sic} Pink, she having been condemn'd <paren>
which, as we were informed was accordingly done, after having taken her
Masts out, and whatever else was thought necessary, on the twenty eighth
of <font> September <$$font>, by towing her ashore, and skuttling her,
and afterwards setting her on Fire <$$paren> we and our <font> Spanish
<$$font> Prize sailed from the Island of <font> Juan Fernandez <$$font>.
OFFICER-1744-1,239.566

It was upon this Island that Captain <font> Sharpe <$$font> left a <font>
Moskito Indian <$$font>, in the Year 1681.  {COM:sic} who remained there
three Years.  OFFICER-1744-1,239.567

He had with him his Gun, a Knife, a small Barrel of Powder, and a
few Shot.  OFFICER-1744-1,239.568

He chose for his Habitation a pleasant Valley, about half a Mile from
the Sea Coast, where he erected a very convenient Hut, and lin'd it
with Seal-skins, and made a Bed of the same, which served likewise for
his cloathing.  OFFICER-1744-1,239.569

When his Powder and Shot were spent, he sawed his Gun Barrel into several
Pieces with his Knife, which he converted into a Saw by the Help of a
Flint; OFFICER-1744-1,239.570

these Pieces he made into Harpoons, Lances, and Fishhooks;
OFFICER-1744-1,239.571

and made himself with one of them another long Knife:
OFFICER-1744-1,239.572

This he did by heating the Pieces first in the Fire, and afterwards
working them on the Stones, which cost him abundance of Labour.
OFFICER-1744-1,239.573

With these he used to strike and kill the Goats and Fish for his
Subsistence, on which he lived pretty comfortably.  OFFICER-1744-1,239.574

He remained in this Condition on the Island until <font> March <$$font>
1684, when he was delivered thence, <P_240> by some <font> English
<$$font> Ships which came there to careen.  OFFICER-1744-1,240.575

When he first saw them at Sea, he guessed they were <font> English
<$$font>, OFFICER-1744-1,240.576

and being overjoyed with the Prospect, returned to his Hutt,
OFFICER-1744-1,240.577

and went to cooking for their Reception; OFFICER-1744-1,240.578

accordingly he dressed two Goats and a large Quantity of Cabbage for
their Entertainment; OFFICER-1744-1,240.579

and what added greatly to his Joy and Pleasure was, that on their coming
ashore he found they were not only <font> English <$$font>, but many
of them his old Acquaintance, who were on Board the Ship which left
him there.  OFFICER-1744-1,240.580

There was also left at this Island in the Year 1704, one <font> Alexander
Selkirk <$$font>, a <font> Scotsman <$$font>; the Reason of which was
a Difference between him and his Captain; OFFICER-1744-1,240.581

this, together with the Ship's being very leaky, made him at first more
willing to stay here, than proceed in the Voyage; OFFICER-1744-1,240.582

but he quickly alter'd his Sentiments, OFFICER-1744-1,240.583

and would gladly have return'd on board, which the Captain refused to
admit of.  OFFICER-1744-1,240.584

He had with him his Cloaths and Bedding, with a Firelock, some Powder
, Bullets, and Tobacco, a Hatchet, a Knife, a Kettle, a Bible,
some practical Books, and his mathematical Books and Instruments;
OFFICER-1744-1,240.585

thus furnished he diverted and provided for himself as well as he could.
OFFICER-1744-1,240.586

He built two Huts with Pimento Trees, OFFICER-1744-1,240.587

and covered them with long Grass, OFFICER-1744-1,240.588

and lined them with the Skins of Goats, which he killed with his Gun ,
as long as his Powder lasted, which was not long, he having but a Pound,
OFFICER-1744-1,240.589

and when that was almost spent, he got Fire by rubbing two Sticks of
Pimento Wood together upon his <P_241> Knee.  OFFICER-1744-1,241.590

In the lesser Hut, some Distance from the other, he dressed his Victuals
, OFFICER-1744-1,241.591

in the larger he slept, OFFICER-1744-1,241.592

and employed himself in reading, singing Psalms, and Praying.
OFFICER-1744-1,241.593

At first he never eat any Thing until Hunger constrained him, partly
for Grief, and partly for want of Bread and Salt; OFFICER-1744-1,241.594

nor did he go to Bed till he could watch no longer; OFFICER-1744-1,241.595

the Pimento Wood which burned very clear, served him both for Fire
and Candle.  OFFICER-1744-1,241.596

He might have Fish enough, OFFICER-1744-1,241.597

but could not eat them for want of Salt, because they occasioned a
Looseness: except Crawfish, which he sometimes boil'd, and at other Times
broil'd, as he did also the Goats Flesh, of which he made good Broth.
OFFICER-1744-1,241.598

When his Powder failed him, he took the Goats by the Swiftness of his
Feet; OFFICER-1744-1,241.599

for being in the Vigour of his Strength, about thirty Years of Age
, and by his way of living, in continual Exercise of walking and
running, cleared of all gross Humours, so that he ran with wonderful
Swiftness thro'the Woods, and up the Rocks and Hills after them.
OFFICER-1744-1,241.600

His Agility in pursuing a Goat had like once to have been very fatal to
him, OFFICER-1744-1,241.601

for he followed it with so much Eagerness that he catched hold of it on
the Brink of a Precipice, of which he was not aware, the Bushes hiding
it from him, so that he fell with the Goat down a great Height, and was
so stunned and bruised with the Fall, that he narrowly escaped with his
Life; OFFICER-1744-1,241.602

and when he came to his Sneses, he found the Goat dead under him.
OFFICER-1744-1,241.603

He lay there about twenty four Hours, OFFICER-1744-1,241.604

and was scarce able to crawl to his <P_242> Hut, or to stir abroad again
in ten Days.  OFFICER-1744-1,242.605

He came at last, {COM:sic} to relish his Meat well enough without Salt
or Bread, OFFICER-1744-1,242.606

and had plenty of Turneps, and Cabbage from the Cabbage Trees,
OFFICER-1744-1,242.607

and seasoned his Meat with the Fruit of the Pimento Trees, which is much
the same as <font> Jamaica <$$font> Pepper.  OFFICER-1744-1,242.608

He soon wore out all his Shoes and Cloaths by running in the Woods,
OFFICER-1744-1,242.609

and at last being forced to shift without them, his Feet became so hard
that he ran every where without Difficulty.  OFFICER-1744-1,242.610

He was at first much pestered with Cats and Rats which had bred in great
Numbers from some of each Species that had got ashore from Ships which
put in there to Wood and Water.  OFFICER-1744-1,242.611

The Rats gnawed his Feet and Cloaths while asleep, which obliged him to
cherish his Cats with his Goats Flesh, whereby many of them became so
tame, that they would lie about him in great Numbers, and soon delivered
him from the Rats.  OFFICER-1744-1,242.612

When his Cloaths were wore out, he made himself a coat and Cap of Goat
Skins, which he stitch'd together with Thongs of the same, and a Needle
made of a Nail sharpened upon the Stones; OFFICER-1744-1,242.613

and some Shirts he made of some Linnen Cloth he had by him,
OFFICER-1744-1,242.614

and stitch'd them with the Worsted of his old Stockings, which he pulled
out on Purpose.  OFFICER-1744-1,242.615

In this Condition he remained four Years and four Months, till <font>
February <$$font>, 1709, when some <font> English <$$font> Ships being on
that Coast in the Night, saw a Light on the Shore, which they imagined
to be some <font> French <$$font> Ships at anchor, with whom they must
either fight, or want Water <font>: <$$font> OFFICER-1744-1,242.616

<P_243>

this filled them with various Apprehensions, OFFICER-1744-1,243.618

and one poor naked Man, passed in their Imaginations for a <font> Spanish
<$$font> Garrison, for a Body of <font> Frenchmen <$$font>, or a Crew of
Pyrates; which all vanished in the Morning, when they found it was the
Fires made by this happy unhappy Man, whom they brought from the Shore
in his Cloathing of Goats Skins.  OFFICER-1744-1,243.619

He had in great measure forgot his Language for want of Use.
OFFICER-1744-1,243.620

At his first coming on Board, they offered him a Dram,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.621

but he refused it, having drank nothing but Water since his being on
the Island.  OFFICER-1744-1,243.622

During his stay in this Place, there had several Ships passed by,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.623

and but only two came to an Anchor, which were <font> Spaniards <$$font>
, who landed before he knew what they were, OFFICER-1744-1,243.624

and they came so near him, that he had much ado to escape,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.625

for they not only shot at him, OFFICER-1744-1,243.626

but pursued him to the Top of a Tree, to the Foot of which they came,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.627

and killed several Goats just by, OFFICER-1744-1,243.628

but went off without discovering him.  OFFICER-1744-1,243.629

<font> Saturday <$$font>, <font> October 3 <$$font>.
OFFICER-1744-1,243.630

At one in the Afternoon, we saw two Sail, OFFICER-1744-1,243.631

and accordingly gave chace, OFFICER-1744-1,243.632

and came up with them, which prov'd to be the <font> Tryal <$$font>, and
a Prize which she had taken during our separation.  OFFICER-1744-1,243.633

This Prize was called the <font> Arransaso <$$font>,
OFFICER-1744-1,243.634

and had on board 606 <font> lb <$$font> Weight of Silver, and twelve Pound
weight of Gold, and two Chests of wrought Plate, being a set of curious
Plate lately purchased for a Church, with several costly Images of <P_244>
Saints finely wrought, and near two Foot long, which we afterwards beat
up close to make them lye snug in the Chests.  OFFICER-1744-1,244.635

The <font> Tryal <$$font> in chasing this Prize, having sprung
her Foremast and Mainmast, was condemned by the Commodore,
OFFICER-1744-1,244.636

and the Prize, which she had taken, being a fine strong Vessel, and
fit for a Man of War, was commission'd by the Name of the <font> Tryal
<$$font>'s Prize, and the Crew of the former turn'd over into her.
OFFICER-1744-1,244.637

And, on <font> Sunday <$$font>, <font> October <$$font> 4.  {COM:sic}
The <font> Tryal <$$font> was destroy'd, by scuttling her on each side :
OFFICER-1744-1,244.638

for if they had set her on Fire, they were afraid of alarming the Coast.
OFFICER-1744-1,244.639

and tried the Current, OFFICER-1744-1,245.667

and found it to set West by South one Knot.  OFFICER-1744-1,245.668

We were now off the Island of <font> Lobos <$$font>, 6 Degrees 20 Minutes
South Latitude; OFFICER-1744-1,245.669

this Island at Sea appears of an indifferent height;
OFFICER-1744-1,245.670

about a quarter of a Mile from the North End is a great hollow Rock,
and a good Channel, where is seven Fathom Water, in which is an Harbour
on the North East, but no fresh Water; OFFICER-1744-1,245.671

the Island is about two Leagues in Compass, OFFICER-1744-1,245.672

but produces neither Trees, Bushes, nor Herbage, OFFICER-1744-1,245.673

but there are abundance of Penguins and Boobies, which are Water Fowls,
somewhat less than a Hen, of a light greyish Colour, with a long Bill
, a little longer and bigger than a Crow's, and broader at the End.
OFFICER-1744-1,245.674

Their Feet are flat like a Duck's Foot; OFFICER-1744-1,245.675

they are a very simple Bird, OFFICER-1744-1,245.676

and will hardly go out of a Man's way.  OFFICER-1744-1,245.677

At two in the Afternoon we saw a Sail bearing N.W.  by North,
OFFICER-1744-1,246.688

and gave chase, she standing to the S.E.  OFFICER-1744-1,246.689

At six we came up with her OFFICER-1744-1,246.690

and took her.  OFFICER-1744-1,246.691

She was loaden with Planks and Iron.  OFFICER-1744-1,246.692

The Captain of her had his Wife and two Daughters on Board, whom
the Commodore immediately ordered into our own Ship, to prevent any
Indecencies that possibly might be committed on the Women, and likewise
admitted them and the <font> Spanish <$$font> Captain to dine with him
every Day: which generous Treatment from an Enemy had such an Effect
on the <font> Spanish <$$font> Captain, that he informed the Commodore
how he might plunder the Town of <font> Payta <$$font>, which, tho' but
a small Town, was very rich; and likewise offer'd to conduct his Men.
OFFICER-1744-1,246.693

Accordingly the Commodore accepted his Offer, OFFICER-1744-1,246.694

and we steer'd our Course for that Place; OFFICER-1744-1,246.695

with 8 Oars, and likewise the <font> Tryal <$$font>'s Prize Boat with
8 Oars, OFFICER-1744-1,247.739

and sent in them between 60 and 70 Men, under the Conduct of the <font>
Spanish <$$font> Captain, and commanded by Mr. <font> Bret,
<$$font> our second <P_248> Lieutenant, who were to be back'd with our
Ships in the Morning; OFFICER-1744-1,248.740

accordingly we set off OFFICER-1744-1,248.741

and lay under the Land till Evening, OFFICER-1744-1,248.742

and about 10 we entered the Harbour of <font> Payta <$$font>, undiscovered
by the Fort and Vessels there, OFFICER-1744-1,248.743

and landed.  OFFICER-1744-1,248.744

We were no sooner ashore, but some march'd, or rather run to the
Fort, shooting at every Person they met, which alarm'd the Fort;
OFFICER-1744-1,248.745

and they, firing upon us with their small Arms, kill'd one Man
OFFICER-1744-1,248.746

and wounded seven.  OFFICER-1744-1,248.747

But, however, that did not discourage us, OFFICER-1744-1,248.748

for we soon forc'd the Gates of the Fort, OFFICER-1744-1,248.749

and the <font> Spaniards <$$font> as soon deserted it;
OFFICER-1744-1,248.750

they fired no more at us; OFFICER-1744-1,248.751

hereupon we took Possession of it, OFFICER-1744-1,248.752

and nail'd up four Pieces of Cannon, <paren> which were quite
$honey-comb'd {TEXT:honey_comb'd}, and so of little use <$$paren>
OFFICER-1744-1,248.753

and hoisted <font> English <$$font> Colours; during which Time, others
having attack'd the Governor's House, whereof they soon made themselves
Masters, alarm'd the whole Town; OFFICER-1744-1,248.754

and the Inhabitants not expecting any such Visit, and taking them in
their first Sleep, were so terribly frighten'd, that they fled to the
Mountains almost naked: OFFICER-1744-1,248.755

For when we came into their Houses and enter'd their Bed Chambers,
their Beds were as warm as if they had that Moment got out of them,
OFFICER-1744-1,248.756

and their Day Cloaths lay all about their Rooms.  OFFICER-1744-1,248.757

As soon as we were Masters of the Town, we began to plunder and play
our Tricks.  OFFICER-1744-1,248.758
