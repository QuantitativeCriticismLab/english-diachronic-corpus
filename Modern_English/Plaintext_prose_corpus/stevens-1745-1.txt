Act.  {COM:sic} II.  STEVENS-1745-1,18.3

Scene I.  STEVENS-1745-1,18.4

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Humphry Fat-sides, <font> solus.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,18.5

<$$heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Humphry.  Zoons!  STEVENS-1745-1,18.7

that Wine last Night has swell'd me like a <font> Porpus.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,18.8

Bad Wine is Ratsbane to me; STEVENS-1745-1,18.9

but $it $'s {TEXT:it's} as much owing to my Constitution, as any Thing.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.10

- Well!  I shall never hold it long, STEVENS-1745-1,18.11

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} certain.  STEVENS-1745-1,18.12

$It $'s {TEXT:Its} an ill Sign, when the Appetite fails.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.13

Time has been, I could have eat every Hour in the Day.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.14

- But now, Heaven help me!  STEVENS-1745-1,18.15

five or six Meals will serve the whole Four and Twenty Hours.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.16

- When one $can $n't {TEXT:can't} eat, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} Time to say
one's Prayers.  STEVENS-1745-1,18.17

<font> Enter <$$font> Ned Easy.  STEVENS-1745-1,18.18

<font> Easy.  <$$font> What!  Sir <font> Humphry; <$$font> How fares it
with my old Friend?  STEVENS-1745-1,18.19

Time has separated our Persons indeed, but I hope, not our Friendship.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.20

I am glad to see you look so well.  STEVENS-1745-1,18.21

You hold your own, I see.  - No ways declining in your Person.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.22

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> In that Point, you are mistaken,
<font> Ned.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,18.23

But $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} glad to see you with all my Heart.
STEVENS-1745-1,18.24

- For I am declining every Way, as in Eating, Drinking, Whoring, being
merry; STEVENS-1745-1,18.25

- why - I am as dull, Man!  as a Cat, that has lately lost her
Kittens; tho'it is chiefly owing to the Want of <P_19> good Company.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.26

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} not one good Fellow left in Town, that is
worth conversing with.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.27

- Well!  Go when I will, $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} never meet my Fellow.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.28

<font> Easy {TEXT:missing_period} <$$font> That $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll}
be sworn, Sir <font> Humphry.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,19.29

But $what $'s {TEXT:what's} become of our old Friend, Sir <font>
Charles Freeman?  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,19.30

You and he us'd to be Inseparables.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.31

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} true, <font>
Ned <$$font>, STEVENS-1745-1,19.32

I see him often; STEVENS-1745-1,19.33

but $he $'s {TEXT:he's} grown such a mad-headed Fellow of late, - so
much degenerated from his antient Friendship, that $he $'s {TEXT:he's}
continually making me his Butt to shoot his Jests at; that was I to
keep him constant Company, I should soon dwindle into an Anatomy, die
of a Consumption, and have my Elegy roar'd about the Streets for him
to read, and laugh at, boasting that he roasted me out of this little
Breath I have.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.34

No, no, <font> Ned <$$font>, I have done with him.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.35

- Yet I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help thinking, the young Dog puts
Love-powder in my Wine.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.36

- Meet him when I will, we must drink together, STEVENS-1745-1,19.37

and then I cling to him, as close as Nature to her own Works.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.38

<font> Easy <$$font> He always was a free-hearted Lad,
STEVENS-1745-1,19.39

lov'd a Jest, STEVENS-1745-1,19.40

and always spoke it home; STEVENS-1745-1,19.41

I am sorry however, he should bear upon his old Acquaintance so hard.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.42

- But, if I mistake not, here he comes.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.43

- $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} speak to him in your Behalf.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.44

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Dear <font> Ned <$$font>, let me go;
STEVENS-1745-1,19.45

for the young Dog certainly carries a Familiar about him.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.46

If I see but his Face, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} enough; STEVENS-1745-1,19.47

I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't} part from him these twelve Hours.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.48

<font> Easy <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} now too late to avoid him,
Sir <font> Humphry <$$font>; STEVENS-1745-1,19.49

for $he $'s {TEXT:he's} just upon us.  STEVENS-1745-1,19.50

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Then, dear <font> Ned <$$font>, let
me stand behind you; STEVENS-1745-1,19.51

and do you shift him off, my good Friend, as soon as possible.
STEVENS-1745-1,19.52

<P_20>

<font> Easy <$$font> Well, Sir <font> Humphry <$$font>, $I $'ll
{TEXT:I'll} do you that Courtesy; STEVENS-1745-1,20.54

but, I fear, it will too nearly resemble that Scene in the Second
Part of <font> Henry the Fourth <$$font>, of the Page's Attempt to
screen Sir <font> John Falstaff <$$font> from the Eye of Justice.
STEVENS-1745-1,20.55

<bracket> <font> Sir <$$font> Humphry <font> goes behind <$$font> Easy.
STEVENS-1745-1,20.56

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles Freeman.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.57

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Dear <font> Ned Easy <$$font>, $Thou
$'rt {TEXT:Thou'rt} welcome to Town, my Boy.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.58

Give me thy Hand.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.59

- What $Smell $'s {TEXT:Smell's} this?  STEVENS-1745-1,20.60

- $Does $n't {TEXT:Doesn't} something offend thy Nose, <font> Ned?
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,20.61

<bracket> <font> seeing Sir <$$font> Humphry.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.62

<$$bracket> <font> Easy <$$font> Not mine, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>
, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} assure you.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.63

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> So!  $he $'s {TEXT:he's} beginning;
STEVENS-1745-1,20.64

but all my Hopes are, that he sees me not.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.65

I wish he were once gone.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.66

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,20.67

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Then $thou $'st {TEXT:thou'st} lost
the Sense of thy Smelling.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.68

Which Way are you walking?  STEVENS-1745-1,20.69

<font> Easy <$$font> To my Lodgings, Sir <font> Charles.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,20.70

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> If they are not too far off, $I $'ll
{TEXT:I'll} walk with you.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.71

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> A pox confound him!
STEVENS-1745-1,20.72

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} as I thought.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.73

Well!  $there $'s {TEXT:there's} no Way left to escape him.
STEVENS-1745-1,20.74

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} turn it into Banter.  <bracket> <font> Aside.
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,20.75

<font> <bracket> He comes from behind <$$font> Easy.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.76

What!  Sir <font> Charles.  <$$font> - How fares it with you?
STEVENS-1745-1,20.77

I find an old Acquaintance may stand Hours before $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll}
speak to him.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.78

By Heavens!  thou art not worth hanging of late.  STEVENS-1745-1,20.79

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> What!  Sir <font> Humphry <$$font> there.
STEVENS-1745-1,20.80

<font> Ned <$$font>, how could'st bear him so long behind thee?
STEVENS-1745-1,20.81

Are you not almost suffocated?  STEVENS-1745-1,20.82

<font> Easy <$$font> With what.  Sir <font> Charles?  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,20.83

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Why, with his Breath, Man.
STEVENS-1745-1,20.84

He feeds on nothing but Garlick and Onions; STEVENS-1745-1,20.85

besides, <P_21> the Grain of his Hide is very rank.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.86

Why, he is grown so troublesome to all his Acquaintance, that they
$can $n't {TEXT:can't} bear him within a Furlong of their Noses.
STEVENS-1745-1,21.87

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Peace, ye Whoreson Knave,
STEVENS-1745-1,21.88

or, by this Light, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} make a Die on't, and lay my Death
to your Charge.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.89

<font> Easy <$$font> Come, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, you must bear
with your old Friend.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.90

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> But I must tell you, <font> Ned <$$font>
- The other Day, as I was talking with an old Friend of ours, <font>
Ned Rakewell <$$font>, all on a sudden he started, asking me, if I did
not smell Punch, <paren> meaning Sir <font> Humphry <$$paren> <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,21.91

why, answers I, I have a Scent of him.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.92

- Well!  Adieu then, says he, STEVENS-1745-1,21.93

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} bear him any nearer.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.94

So taking his Leave, in an abrupt Manner, left me - STEVENS-1745-1,21.95

I, turning the Corner of the Street, meets Sir <font> Humphry <$$font>
, puffing and blowing, as if his Guts were about his Heels, infecting
the wholesome Air with his rank Breath.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.96

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Why, <font> Ned <$$font>, only that
I know $he $'s {TEXT:he's} bantering me, STEVENS-1745-1,21.97

or else $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} cafe him, like a Rabbit.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.98

- You know, I always wear my Rapier sharp; STEVENS-1745-1,21.99

it will answer the Purpose, when I put it to the Trial.
STEVENS-1745-1,21.100

He knows he $durst $n't {TEXT:durstn't} use me thus, if -
STEVENS-1745-1,21.101

But he presumes on my Patience.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.102

I am made up, he knows, of nothing but Patience.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.103

- $He $'s {TEXT:He's} willing to gall and fret me, STEVENS-1745-1,21.104

but I am not to be mov'd.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.105

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Not all Patience!  a few Guts, good
Sir <font> Humphry.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,21.106

I must say this for thee, STEVENS-1745-1,21.107

$thou $'rt {TEXT:thou'rt} as sweet a Composition of good Nature and Smell,
as any <font> Pole-Cat <$$font> in <font> Europe <$$font>, as your old
Friend <font> Rakewell <$$font> observes.  STEVENS-1745-1,21.108

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Well!  I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} hold it
any longer.  - You Knighted Grey-hound; <font> you French <$$font> Curs.
STEVENS-1745-1,21.109

Both <P_22> <font> Rakewell <$$font> and you look like the very Scum and
Refuse of <font> France <$$font>, as if neither of you had fed on any
Thing but Soups, stew'd from a Carrot or Cabbage.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.110

Nature is asham'd to own such Sons of Poverty.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.111

- Had I a Looking-Glass here, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} make you blush at your
own despicable Figures if you had any Grace in you.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.112

Dear <font> Ned Easy <$$font>, do you bear me Witness, if what I say be
not just: STEVENS-1745-1,22.113

His Eyes are shrunk into his Head; STEVENS-1745-1,22.114

his Forehead has as many Wrinkles, as that of a worn out Bawd;
STEVENS-1745-1,22.115

his Cheeks are drawn into his Throat, to assist his Lungs;
STEVENS-1745-1,22.116

and his Chops look as thin and meagre, as Don <font> Quixotes
<$$font>, the <font> Knight of the woful Countenance.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,22.117

His Chin represents a Boy's Gig; STEVENS-1745-1,22.118

his Arms and Legs are dwindled away with Whoring; STEVENS-1745-1,22.119

and his $Body $'s {TEXT:Body's} decay'd with Intemperance.
STEVENS-1745-1,22.120

Examine him throughout, and he makes a most shocking Figure.
STEVENS-1745-1,22.121

Why, Man!  STEVENS-1745-1,22.122

- but hold!  STEVENS-1745-1,22.123

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} call thee so neither.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.124

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a Wrong done to those that really are so.
STEVENS-1745-1,22.125

Thou only art the awkward Representation of a Man.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.126

Dear <font> Ned <$$font>, do but observe him.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.127

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} really a mere <font> Memento Mori.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,22.128

Look on me.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.129

I am the Reverse.  A Man that has Substance, not Appearance only, the
portly Bulk of a Man.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.130

But $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} to blame.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.131

Patience is a Virtue, by which we should curb our Passions.
STEVENS-1745-1,22.132

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} done; STEVENS-1745-1,22.133

I have overcome myself, STEVENS-1745-1,22.134

and all is over.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.135

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a fine Thing to be the Master of one's Passions.
STEVENS-1745-1,22.136

Come, <font> Charles <$$font>, your Hand, my Boy.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.137

<bracket> <font> takes hold of his Hand.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,22.138

<$$bracket> I have done; STEVENS-1745-1,22.139

I am quite cool.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.140

I have run over your Infirmities but slightly.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.141

I love to make the best of Things; STEVENS-1745-1,22.142

I - STEVENS-1745-1,22.143

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Nay, if you have not done, take Breath
a little, STEVENS-1745-1,22.144

and begin again.  STEVENS-1745-1,22.145

- $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} hear you, with your own Virtue, Patience
STEVENS-1745-1,22.146

but I am <P_23> much afraid you have over-heated your Grease;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.147

and should it be so; should any Part of it chance to drop on thy inflam'd
Liver, it might go near to set that Lump of combustible Stuff on Fire.
STEVENS-1745-1,23.148

<font> Easy.  <$$font> Come, come, Friends, have done;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.149

both have done; STEVENS-1745-1,23.150

$you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} not give me Leave to put a Word in.
STEVENS-1745-1,23.151

- Pray $let $'s {TEXT:let's} turn this Conversation.
STEVENS-1745-1,23.152

- How fares it with <font> Modern's <$$font> Family?
STEVENS-1745-1,23.153

Are either of his beautiful Nieces married yet?  STEVENS-1745-1,23.154

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> If $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} undertake
to mediate a Peace between Sir <font> Charles <$$font> and myself, $I
$'ll {TEXT:I'll} undertake to inform you of <font> Modern.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,23.155

<font> Easy.  <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} answer for Sir <font> Charles.
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,23.156

- But what of <font> Modern?  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,23.157

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Why, Yesterday, I had his Company
from ten in the Morning till ten at Night, and with him, his Cousin
<font> Friendly <$$font>, who is to go out of Town this Morning.
STEVENS-1745-1,23.158

- Sir <font> George <$$font> was quite in the Hyp, and the Reason very
easy to be guess'd.  STEVENS-1745-1,23.159

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> The old Tone; his Wife, I suppose.
STEVENS-1745-1,23.160

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> The same.  STEVENS-1745-1,23.161

- He entertain'd us with a Pack of dismal Stories; STEVENS-1745-1,23.162

but to cast out that Devil <font> Melancholy <$$font>, I ply'd him close
with Wine, which you know Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, is a never-failing
Remedy.  STEVENS-1745-1,23.163

It produced its usual Effects.  STEVENS-1745-1,23.164

The old Knight began to be jolly, STEVENS-1745-1,23.165

and so continued, till he had lost the Use of his Tongue;
STEVENS-1745-1,23.166

and then, being unfit for Company, I sent him home Tongue-tied, that
should his Wife be there, before him, she might take the Opportunity by
his Fault to extenuate her own.  STEVENS-1745-1,23.167

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Well done, <font> Bacchus.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,23.168

- Was that the best Way, you could devise, to sooth the poor Man's Grief,
to send him home uncapable to let his Wife know how far she wrongs
his Honour?  STEVENS-1745-1,23.169

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> The very best Way in the World.  <P_24>
<font> Sir Charles.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.170

Had he gone home sober, he would have touch'd her no doubt to the Quick
with his Reproaches, STEVENS-1745-1,24.171

and that would have been the worst Way in the World -
STEVENS-1745-1,24.172

For when a Woman finds herself lasht hard, she falls into all the
Extravagancies of her Sex: STEVENS-1745-1,24.173

So, in sending him home silent, I made Peace between them both, both
considering themselves Guilty; whereas otherwise, perhaps there might
have been a Separation.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.174

<font> Easy.  <$$font> Thou art an excellent Casuist, and a brave Votary
to the Juice of the Grape - STEVENS-1745-1,24.175

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Oh, Sir, give him but a Text, $he $'ll
{TEXT:he'll} hold forth four and twenty Hours successively, let Drinking
be the Subject STEVENS-1745-1,24.176

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Come, a Plague of you, Sir <font>
Charles <$$font>, STEVENS-1745-1,24.177

you have almost fretted me out of my Spirits.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.178

I shall certainly drop, unless supported by a Rummer of Wine.
STEVENS-1745-1,24.179

What say you?  STEVENS-1745-1,24.180

Shall we empty a Flask together?  STEVENS-1745-1,24.181

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Sir <font> Humphry <$$font>, with all
my Heart.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.182

Come, <font> Ned <$$font>, will you take Part of Sir <font> Humphry's
<$$font> Flask?  STEVENS-1745-1,24.183

<font> Easy <$$font> Will I!  STEVENS-1745-1,24.184

ay, that I will.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.185

Come then, $let $'s {TEXT:let's} away.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.186

$I $'d {TEXT:I'd} pledge Sir <font> Humphry <$$font> in a Bumper, as
soon as any Man I know.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.187

<font> Sir Humph. <$$font> Ay, ay, it shall be my Flask, with
all my Heart; STEVENS-1745-1,24.188

and it joys me much, that I have two of my old Acquaintance to partake
of it.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.189

- But it shall be your two Bottles a Man, before we part.  <font>

Scene II.  STEVENS-1745-1,24.193

Amarinda's <font> Lodgings.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.194

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Amarinda, <font> and <$$font> Betty, <font>
her Maid.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,24.196

<font> Amar. Betty <$$font>, by your long and faithful Services
to my Sister and me, I am thoroughly satisfied you <P_25> love us both ;
STEVENS-1745-1,25.197

and was the Question seriously to be put to you, I am sensible you would
not readily know where to give the Preference.  STEVENS-1745-1,25.198

We have both had sufficient Proofs of your Secrecy; for which Reason I
shall venture to put my Fortune into your Power; and have Confidence
enough to think you will not make an ill Use of this Condescention.
STEVENS-1745-1,25.199

<font> Betty.  <$$font> It has always been the Study of my Life, Madam,
to serve, and please you both; STEVENS-1745-1,25.200

and therefore, dear Madam, believe me, STEVENS-1745-1,25.201

and I swear by the God of Love, and as I hope to be married very soon
, <paren> and I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} swear by any Thing greater,
nor by any Thing I desire more <$$paren> that let it be what it will,
I will be as secret as the Grave, and as circumspect as <font> Argus.
STEVENS-1745-1,25.202

- <$$font> <font> Amar. <$$font> Know then, <font> Betty <$$font>
, there has long been an Amour subsisting between Sir <font> Charles
Freeman <$$font> and myself, STEVENS-1745-1,25.203

and I have too much Reason to suspect that poor <font> Juliana <$$font>
is caught in the same Snare.  STEVENS-1745-1,25.204

- I have desir'd Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, whenever he comes, not
to make the least Difference between us, unless it were to give <font>
Juliana <$$font> the Preference.  STEVENS-1745-1,25.205

How far I have been to blame in this Conduct to my Sister, I will not
take upon me to determine.  STEVENS-1745-1,25.206

- This Secret therefore you must sift out of her, which will satisfy my
impatient Curiosity, and give Sir <font> Charles <$$font> Time to make
a speedy, and honourable Retreat.  STEVENS-1745-1,25.207

- And then we must lay our Heads together to fix her somewhere else.
STEVENS-1745-1,25.208

<font> Betty.  <$$font> You are mighty secret, Madam, me thinks,
in your Amours, not to call in to your Assistance any Confident.
STEVENS-1745-1,25.209

But, Madam, I have not been a Chamber-Maid so long, but I could have told
you, <paren> had Forwardness and impertinence belong'd to our Sphere
<$$paren> that you lov'd him, and <P_26> he you, long before either of
you told one another.  STEVENS-1745-1,26.210

- As to <font> Juliana <$$font>, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} attack her the
Instant she returns, or at least, the first convenient Opportunity.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.211

So, you may depend upon hearing the most intimate Secret of her Heart
in that Affair.  STEVENS-1745-1,26.212

But I fear, when you have, it will prove but a bitter Potion to you.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.213

<font> Amar. <$$font> Oh, <font> Betty <$$font>, whenever you
marry, let Love have the least Share in the Matrimonial Composition.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.214

- For could I but convey to you the least faint Idea of the unutterable
Anxieties I feel from this Suspicion only, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sure it
would learn you to keep your Heart more at Liberty than has, I fear,
the undone <font> Amarinda.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,26.215

<bracket> <font> She sighs <$$font>, STEVENS-1745-1,26.216

Betty <font> laughs.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,26.217

<font> Betty.  <$$font> Dear Madam, pray excuse me, STEVENS-1745-1,26.218

I must laugh, were I to die for't.  STEVENS-1745-1,26.219

- Let Love have the least Share in the Matrimonial Composition.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.220

- Why, Madam, poor as I am, I would not marry a Man I did not love, had
he the Riches of both the <font> Indies; <$$font> tho'I were sure to be
made a Cripple by the Man I doated on before the Honey-moon was over.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.221

<font> Amar. <$$font> If you continue in this romantic
Notion, <font> Betty <$$font>, I doubt that will be thy Fate.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.222

<font> Betty <$$font> Why, your Ladyship seems pretty much in the same
at present.  STEVENS-1745-1,26.223

<font> Amar. <$$font> Oh, Child, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} that which
gives me all this Uneasiness: STEVENS-1745-1,26.224

Was I Careless or indifferent, as to Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, I might,
perhaps, readily relinquish him, and make <font> Juliana <$$font> happy
in her Love; STEVENS-1745-1,26.225

but, as it is, it may probably make an irreparable Breach between us.
STEVENS-1745-1,26.226

For Rivals and Friendship are as great Opposites, as Light and Darkness ,
which nothing but that Dear Dear - I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what -

<P_27>

<font> Betty.  <$$font> But it is to be hop'd you will know what, very
shortly, Madam - STEVENS-1745-1,27.229

Be sure however, STEVENS-1745-1,27.230

let Love have the least Share in the Composition.  STEVENS-1745-1,27.231

<font> Before I would live with the Man that I hate, With the Man that

Well, Madam, rest satisfy'd, STEVENS-1745-1,27.234

and render me incapable in the publick Papers from ever serving a Lady for
the future, should it prove as you suspect - If I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}

<font> Amar. <$$font> Oh, dear <font> Juliana <$$font>, you are
welcome home; STEVENS-1745-1,27.241

I wish you had been here a little sooner to have partaken of it.
STEVENS-1745-1,27.242

The Girl has made me laugh till I am quite Sick.  STEVENS-1745-1,27.243

I have been catechising her Heart.  STEVENS-1745-1,27.244

She has repeated to me her whole Creed in Love Affairs.
STEVENS-1745-1,27.245

- She would make an excellent <font> Roman <$$font> Catholick.
STEVENS-1745-1,27.246

- Has quite an implicit Faith.  STEVENS-1745-1,27.247

<font> Betty.  <$$font> Well, Ladies, I see you are dispos'd to be merry
at my Infirmities: STEVENS-1745-1,27.248

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} leave you.  STEVENS-1745-1,27.249

STEVENS-1745-1,27.250

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Betty.  STEVENS-1745-1,27.251

<font> Amar. <$$font> She says, she believes she could not be

of both the <font> Indies: <$$font> Nay, tho'she were almost fare to
be made a <P_28> Cripple by the Man she doated on before the Honey-moon

<font> Jul. <$$font> I ask her Pardon there: Tho'my Heart tells
me I cou'd do much for the Man I lov'd.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.253

- Yet bar all Crutches.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.254

- Besides, $me $thinks {TEXT:methinks}, $she $'s {TEXT:she's} over-hasty
to be miserable.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.255

She might have allowed herself one Month at least of Happiness:
STEVENS-1745-1,28.256

- To this Article of her Creed I must prove a Heretick.
STEVENS-1745-1,28.257

- But proceed.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.258

STEVENS-1745-1,28.264

<font> Jul. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know;
STEVENS-1745-1,28.265

Mrs <font> Edging <$$font> was not at home herself.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.266

- Besides, I would not pay for't, before I knew whether you lik'd it
or not.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.267

- O Sister, I saw there the richest Suit of Lac'd Night-Cloaths I
ever beheld with my Eyes, just going home to Lady <font> Spendthrifts.
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,28.268

- There had like to have been a Separation between my Lord and her this
last Week.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.269

<font> Amar <$$font> How pray?  STEVENS-1745-1,28.270

<font> Jul. <$$font> Only his Lordship came home a little sooner
than she expected one Night, STEVENS-1745-1,28.271

and found her Ladyship with a Gentleman in her Chamber;
STEVENS-1745-1,28.272

and his Lordship, not thinking such a Familiarity very decent there, -
had the Assurance to call them both to an Account.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.273

It happened the poor Gentleman look't as stupid as an Ass, and her
Ladyship, like an inrag'd Tygress.  STEVENS-1745-1,28.274

His Lordship drew his Sword; STEVENS-1745-1,28.275

but the Gentleman, chusing rather to submit himself to his Lordship's
Pleasure, than put <P_29> his Life to the Hazard of so dangerous an
Enterprize, suffer'd himself tamely to be kick'd down Stairs, and stand
the Correction of the Footmen below, who gave him a handsome Dose, and
turn'd him out of Doors, as frighten'd, as a Dog with an empty Cannister
at his Tail.  STEVENS-1745-1,29.276

<font> Amar. <$$font> Well!  but the Consequences.
STEVENS-1745-1,29.277

<font> Jul. <$$font> Her Ladyship put on all the Wife;
STEVENS-1745-1,29.278

was surpriz'd at his Impudence, in presuming to $disturb {TEXT:dissturb}
her in her Privacies, without first enquiring whether she was busy or not:
- That her Chamber was her Asylum; that she had no other Business with
the Gentleman, than to learn a new Song, - without which, it was almost a
Sin to go into, polite Company: - That he was an <font> Italian <$$font>,
and one of the last Men in the World she wou'd have pitch'd upon to wrong
his Honour, - and was she that Way inclin'd, she had more Sense than
to place the Scene of Action at home, - and that she was determin'd,
since he harbour'd so mean an Opinion of her Virtue, upon so slight a
Foundation, never to Bed with him from that Night; STEVENS-1745-1,29.279

and so left him.  STEVENS-1745-1,29.280

<font> Amr. <$$font> God a Mercy, Lady <font> Spendthrift!
STEVENS-1745-1,29.281

<$$font> Well!  the Conclusion.  STEVENS-1745-1,29.282

<font> Jul. <$$font> My Lord, as you know, being excessively fond
of her, has never had one Moment's Peace since; STEVENS-1745-1,29.283

for she continued as obstinate as a <font> Jew; <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,29.284

- but at last they capitulated upon these Terms, that his Lordship should
present her with a new Suit of Lac'd Night-Cloaths, the richest that
could be bought, against her second Wedding-Night, - and never presume
to enter her Chamber any more, without first enquiring whether she was
at leisure, upon Pain of her perpetual Displeasure.  STEVENS-1745-1,29.285

<P_30>

<font> Amar. <$$font> His Lordship certainly never agreed to
the Conditions.  STEVENS-1745-1,30.287

<font> Jul. <$$font> O, joyfully, and readily.
STEVENS-1745-1,30.288

- The Story, I find is in every Body's Mouth; STEVENS-1745-1,30.289

for she herself has already blaz'd it about among all her Acquaintance.
STEVENS-1745-1,30.290

<font> Amar. <$$font> O <font> Juliana <$$font>, to what a pitch
of Presumtion are the Wives of this Age arriv'd!  STEVENS-1745-1,30.291

I hope, if I know myself, whenever we enter that wisht-for State, we

<font> Jul. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know that, Sister.
STEVENS-1745-1,30.293

When we enter ourselves amongst the Herd, if we presume to single

STEVENS-1745-1,34.398

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> No farther, Madam, than this: STEVENS-1745-1,34.399

- He laid hold of that Opportunity to press me to acquaint your Ladyship
how much he admir'd <P_35> you.  STEVENS-1745-1,35.400

- He said a Thousand fine Things indeed, concerning you,
STEVENS-1745-1,35.401

- and he did it with so soft, and so moving an Air, that had he said
but half so much in relation to myself, such a natural Hankering have
I after the Sex, that I had been but in a weak Posture of Defence.

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Charity, Madam, is as much our Duty, as any one

<$$heading>

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> So, <font> Ned!  <$$font> quite punctual.
STEVENS-1745-1,40.570

- Then to our Business - STEVENS-1745-1,40.571

If I mistake not, - you were saying last Night, that you had
an Inclination for one of <font> Modern's <$$font> Nieces.
STEVENS-1745-1,40.572

Pray which of them is your Flame?  STEVENS-1745-1,40.573

Or are you careless?  STEVENS-1745-1,40.574

Will either of them go down?  STEVENS-1745-1,40.575

<font> Easy.  <$$font> Why, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, as you are my
Father Confessor, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} make no Scruple of owning to you,
that I have conceiv'd a Passion for <font> Juliana <$$font>, this long
Time; STEVENS-1745-1,40.576

but my Father's inexcusable Temper is too well known.
STEVENS-1745-1,40.577

I have, therefore, hitherto chose to stifle my Inclinations, not
having it in my Power to make any honourable Propositions to her.
STEVENS-1745-1,40.578

- But pray, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, what Reason could induce you
to draw this severe Confession from me?  STEVENS-1745-1,40.579

<P_41>

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be ingenous,
<font> Ned.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,41.581

I am a Slave, you must know, to <font> Amarinda <$$font>,
STEVENS-1745-1,41.582

and was willing, therefore, to be satisfied with respect to the dear
Object of your Wishes.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.583

As therefore, we are not Rivals, we may still continue Friends;
STEVENS-1745-1,41.584

and to communicate a Secret to you, - <font> Amarinda <$$font> and I
have sign'd and seal'd our mutual Contract; - tho'she has injoin'd me
to discover nothing by my Behaviour to her, that may give the least
Suspicion to her Sister.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.585

- By this Method of proceeding, I am sorry to say, I believe <font>
Juliana <$$font> has a greater Respect for me than she ought.
STEVENS-1745-1,41.586

- But since I know your Mind, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} soon give her some
Distaste, STEVENS-1745-1,41.587

and I know her Spirit so well, that $she $'ll {TEXT:she'll} readily
marry you to be reveng'd of me.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.588

- So we may both succeed, and be happy.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.589

I am to meet them To-morrow Evening at six, at the Backside of the Park,
where you may, as by Accident, meet us; STEVENS-1745-1,41.590

and the Knowledge you already have of them, and the intimate Friendship
they know is subsisting between us, are Motives strong enough to introduce
you; STEVENS-1745-1,41.591

and from thence we may proceed for the future.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.592

- But be sure you make strong Love to <font> Juliana.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,41.593

<font> Easy.  <$$font> I am infinitely oblig'd to you, Sir <font>
Charles <$$font>, for your kind Proposal; STEVENS-1745-1,41.594

but I fear $'t $will {TEXT:'twill} look too mercenary to have no other

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Do you but observe my Directions,
STEVENS-1745-1,41.596

and let me alone to manage the old Gentleman.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.597

- Your Father and I met in Company with some more Gentlemen the other
Day, STEVENS-1745-1,41.598

and as soon as I had an Opportunity, I spoke to him, concerning his
Treatment of you, as being his only Son.  STEVENS-1745-1,41.599

<P_42>

<font> Easy.  <$$font> So!  What said he, Sir <font> Charles?  <$$font>

I never heard him talk more reasonable in my Life: STEVENS-1745-1,42.604

He spoke home to the Purpose.  STEVENS-1745-1,42.605

- He told the Company indeed, that tho'you had been very extravagant ,
he was glad to hear you was grown wiser; and consequent'y, knew better
how to behave, and live in the World; and that if you persevered, he would
do every Thing in his Power to make you happy.  STEVENS-1745-1,42.606

<font> Easy.  <$$font> $He $'s {TEXT:He's} apt to speak one fair, but

STEVENS-1745-1,42.609

<font> Easy.  <$$font> Well, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, I shall study
to deserve this Friendship.  STEVENS-1745-1,42.610

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Courage, my Boy.  STEVENS-1745-1,42.612

Never fear: $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} undertake to bring your Father over

is to be disbursed.  STEVENS-1745-1,42.614

<font> Easy.  <$$font> Thanks to my most generous Friend.
STEVENS-1745-1,42.615

How shall I be able ever to return this great Obligation?
STEVENS-1745-1,42.616

be excus'd at present, having an Affair of Consequence upon my Hands,
that demands my Attendance; STEVENS-1745-1,42.617

and I fear the Time is elaps'd.  STEVENS-1745-1,42.618

Amarinda.  $What $'s {TEXT:What's} the Matter <font> Juliana?  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,51.883

That Gaiety and Pleasantness, which us'd to triumph in your Countenance,
seems to be overcast To-day.  STEVENS-1745-1,51.884

- I hope your Heart does not begin to repent of the Office your Eyes
did you, as you presag'd it would.  STEVENS-1745-1,51.885

- <font> Jul. <$$font> As to that, Sister, tho'I have some Reason
to be a little out of Temper, at present, - It shall never give me any
great Uneasiness; STEVENS-1745-1,51.886

for I was always determin'd to follow the Directions of a good old Song.
STEVENS-1745-1,51.887

<font> If he be kind, then $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} prove so;
STEVENS-1745-1,51.888

If he be false, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} fit him too.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,51.889

Should my Countenance seem any ways dull at present, it takes
not my Heart, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} assure you, into its Council.
STEVENS-1745-1,51.890

<font> Amar. <$$font> I am glad to find you prudent enough to
make so happy a Resolution; STEVENS-1745-1,51.891

and only wish you may be able always to keep it.  STEVENS-1745-1,51.892

But Love is so severe a Wound, that it will never bear probing;
STEVENS-1745-1,51.893

- and when once we find ourselves slighted by the Man we admire,
all those heroic Resolutions <P_52> generally vanish into Smoke;
STEVENS-1745-1,52.894

and Woman will be uppermost in all our Sex - STEVENS-1745-1,52.895

But I was going to ask you if you were disposed to take a Turn in the

<font> Jul. <$$font> Nay, Sister, I have the most Reason

Did I bring you such a Fortune, to be denied such Trifles?

but instead of that, their Benevolence extends to none but Foreigners,

<font> Amar. <$$font> I expect no other Company, $I $'ll
{TEXT:I'll} assure you.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1029

<font> Jul. <$$font> Nor I.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1030

- Then he may be as proper a Person as any one to pass away the Evening
with.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1031

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles Freeman.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1032

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> What!  <font> Amarinda <$$font> and
<font> Juliana <$$font> too.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1033

Ladies, I think myself extremely happy, in meeting with you so
accidentally.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1034

<font> Jul. <$$font> So!  he takes my Meaning.
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1035

- It will do very well.  <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1036

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Sure some kind <font> Cupid <$$font>
inspir'd me to come this Way!  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1037

Little did I think to be bless'd with Company so agreeable.
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1038

If $you $'re {TEXT:you're} not better engag'd, Ladies, I would beg the
Continuance of this unexpected Blessing.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1039

<font> Amar. <$$font> Sir we are no ways engag'd this Evening.
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1040

- Ah, <font> Juliana.  <$$font> - I find thy Eyes betray thy Heart,
let thy Actions strive never so to hide it.  <bracket> <font> Aside.
<$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,57.1041

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> Sure, Ladies, it must be but dull walking
without some of our agreeable Sex, to make an Opposition in Conversation.
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1042

<font> Jul. <$$font> Agreeable Sex, say you.
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1043

Pray, in what, Sir <font> Charles?  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,57.1044

<font> Sir Char. <$$font> In pleasing the Ladies, Madam.
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1045

<font> Amar. <$$font> But I thought, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>
, that your Sex wou'd always allow ours the Preference, in point of
Contradiction.  STEVENS-1745-1,57.1046

<font> Enter <$$font> Ned Easy, <font> Bowing.  <$$font>
STEVENS-1745-1,57.1047

<font> Easy.  <$$font> Your most humble servant, Sir <font> Charles.

<font> Juliana.  <$$font> STEVENS-1745-1,58.1049

I thought the Air smelt more fragrant, than usual.  STEVENS-1745-1,58.1050

You, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, are blest indeed, to have the Company
of two such Ladies, whom Nature <paren> that we may hereafter copy
Beauties from them <$$paren> has form'd the most perfect of their Sex.
STEVENS-1745-1,58.1051
