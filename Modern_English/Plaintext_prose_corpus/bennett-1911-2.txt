The Honeymoon BENNETT-1911-2,7.3

Act I.  BENNETT-1911-2,7.4

<$$heading>

<font>

A sitting-room in the only hotel at a small seaside resort in Essex.
BENNETT-1911-2,7.7

Old-fashioned Victorian furniture, producing a picturesque general effect.
BENNETT-1911-2,7.8

Some modern touch, such as a framed coloured advertisement of pneumatic
tyres.  <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.9

<font> Door, <$$font> R., <font> leading to hall, principal
entrance, and kitchen.  BENNETT-1911-2,7.10

Door, <$$font> L., <font> leading through a porch to the garden.
BENNETT-1911-2,7.11

A large window, divided into three portions by stonework, at the back :
BENNETT-1911-2,7.12

the panes are small; BENNETT-1911-2,7.13

one of these portions is open, BENNETT-1911-2,7.14

the others are closed.  <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.15

<font> Through the window can be seen a view of the garden, and the sea
in the distance.  BENNETT-1911-2,7.16

The fireplace is not seen.  <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.17

Cedric <font> and <$$font> Flora <font> are seated at either side of
a tea-table.  <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.18

Time: <font> Afternoon in June.  BENNETT-1911-2,7.19

Sunshine.  <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,7.20

Flora.  Another cup?  BENNETT-1911-2,7.21

<paren> Cedric, <font> looking at her, makes no reply.  <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,7.22

Cedric!  Another Cup?  BENNETT-1911-2,7.23

<P_8> <paren> <font> with a touch of very good-humoured impatience
<$$font> <$$paren>.  <paren> Cedric <font> rises, BENNETT-1911-2,8.24

goes round the table to her, BENNETT-1911-2,8.25

takes hold of her, BENNETT-1911-2,8.26

and kisses her.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.27

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Standing over her, she looking up at him.
<$$font> <$$paren> $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} been wanting to do that for about
thirty solid minutes.  BENNETT-1911-2,8.28

Flora.  Then why $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} you, my poor boy?
BENNETT-1911-2,8.29

<paren> <font> Cedric gives a gesture to show that he $does $n't
{TEXT:doesn't} know why <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.30

...  Instead of keeping us both waiting like that!  BENNETT-1911-2,8.31

<paren> <font> Reflective.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.32

And yet $it $'s {TEXT:it's} barely three hours since you kissed me in
the vestry!  BENNETT-1911-2,8.33

Cedric.  Vestry be dashed! 'BENNETT-1911-2,8.34

And $here $'s {TEXT:here's} another thing $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} been
wanting to do BENNETT-1911-2,8.35

<paren> <font> he carefully kisses her ear <$$font> <$$paren>.
BENNETT-1911-2,8.36

Flora.  My ear!  BENNETT-1911-2,8.37

Cedric.  Precisely, your ear!  Strange!  BENNETT-1911-2,8.38

...  And I can tell you something even stranger.  BENNETT-1911-2,8.39

Shall I?  BENNETT-1911-2,8.40

<paren> <font> She nods.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.41

When $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} standing over you I feel as if I should like to
kill you!  BENNETT-1911-2,8.42

Yes, really, Fluff!  It takes me all of a sudden!  BENNETT-1911-2,8.43

You know - when you lean out of a high balcony and you feel you must jump
- well, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} that sort of a feeling.  BENNETT-1911-2,8.44

Flora.  What particular <font> kind <$$font> of homicide?
BENNETT-1911-2,8.45

Cedric.  Oh!  <paren> <font> at a loss <$$font> <$$paren> a kind of a
fierce crushing.  BENNETT-1911-2,8.46

<paren> <font> She smiles.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,8.47

You think $it $'s {TEXT:it's} justifiable?  BENNETT-1911-2,8.48

<P_9>

Flora.  I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind so long as I know my risks:
BENNETT-1911-2,9.50

Cedric.  <paren> <font> After staring at her, with a convinced
air.  <$$font> <$$paren> We shall get on together all right!
BENNETT-1911-2,9.51

Flora.  Yes, I think $we $'re {TEXT:we're} doing rather well so far ,
considering <paren> <font> turning the ring on his finger <$$font>
<$$paren>.  BENNETT-1911-2,9.52

Cedric.  Considering what?  BENNETT-1911-2,9.53

Flora.  Considering how nervous we both are, naturally BENNETT-1911-2,9.54

<paren> <font> drops his hand <$$font> <$$paren>.  BENNETT-1911-2,9.55

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Moving away.  Half to himself.  <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,9.56

Yes, and we shall keep getting more nervous!  BENNETT-1911-2,9.57

Flora.  <paren> <font> Resuming exactly the same matter-of-fact tone
as when she first put the question.  <$$font> <$$paren> Another cup?
BENNETT-1911-2,9.58

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Similar tone.  <$$font> <$$paren> How many have
I had?  BENNETT-1911-2,9.59

Flora.  I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know, dear.  BENNETT-1911-2,9.60

Cedric.  $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} had enough, then.  BENNETT-1911-2,9.61

Flora.  Well, about our programme.  Suppose we settle it a bit.
BENNETT-1911-2,9.62

Cedric.  Yes, $let $'s {TEXT:let's}.  BENNETT-1911-2,9.63

<paren> <font> Sits down.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,9.64

Flora.  I do think it was a lovely idea to start off without any programme
at all!  BENNETT-1911-2,9.65

Heaven itself $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} say where we $sha $n't
{TEXT:shan't} be this time next week!  BENNETT-1911-2,9.66

Cedric.  Well, subject to your approval, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
mind informing heaven that anyhow we $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't} be here.
BENNETT-1911-2,9.67

Flora.  Tired of this Place - already?  BENNETT-1911-2,9.68

Cedric.  On the contrary!  BENNETT-1911-2,9.69

But $it $'s {TEXT:it's} too small <P_10> to hold a couple that have just
walked out of a vestry.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.70

One hotel, one flagstaff, one boat, one sea.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.71

No pier, no tea-shop, no concert, and very probably no moon.
BENNETT-1911-2,10.72

Flora.  Extrardinary how even three hours of married life will change
a man!  BENNETT-1911-2,10.73

You always used to be rather keen on quietness.  Solitude, old flannel
suits, and so on.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.74

Cedric.  Now look here, Fluff!  BENNETT-1911-2,10.75

This honeymoon programme is important.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.76

Er - <paren> <font> hesitates <$$font> <$$paren>.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.77

Flora.  <paren> <font> Nods.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,10.78

$Let $'s {TEXT:Let's} talk as man to man.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.79

Cedric.  The fact is $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} always had a very Distinct
theory about honeymoons.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.80

Far from The madding crowd is a mistake on a honeymoon...
BENNETT-1911-2,10.81

Solitude!  BENNETT-1911-2,10.82

Wherever you are, if $you $'re {TEXT:you're} on a honeymoon, $you
$'ll {TEXT:you'll} get quite as Much solitude as is good for you every
Twenty-four hours.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.83

Constant change and distraction - $that $'s {TEXT:that's} What wants
arranging for.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.84

Solitude will arrange itself.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.85

Flora.  I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} expect this from you, dear.
BENNETT-1911-2,10.86

Cedric.  <font> Hastily, apologetic.  <$$font> <$$paren> Simply a theory!
BENNETT-1911-2,10.87

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} had no practical experience, BENNETT-1911-2,10.88

and $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} Perfectly ready to sit at your feet in the Matter.
BENNETT-1911-2,10.89

Honestly, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care a straw.  BENNETT-1911-2,10.90

I May be wrong, BENNETT-1911-2,10.91

and if you - BENNETT-1911-2,10.92

Flora.  <paren> <font> Solemnly.  <$$font> <$$paren> You $are $n't
{TEXT:aren't} wrong!  BENNETT-1911-2,10.93

$You $'re {TEXT:You're} quite fearfully right!  BENNETT-1911-2,10.94

Cedric.  <font> After starting at her with a convinced <P_11> air.
<$$font> <$$paren> We <font> shall <$$font> get on together -
BENNETT-1911-2,11.95

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} a bedrock certainly!  BENNETT-1911-2,11.96

Now this place ought to be excellent for a beginning, BENNETT-1911-2,11.97

but I should imagine that about a couple of days of it would do us.
BENNETT-1911-2,11.98

Flora.  I never suspected - no, really I never <font> did <$$font>
suspect - that any man could have as much common-sense, beforehand
{COM:"before"_in_italics}, as you have, Cedric, Not to speak of courage!
BENNETT-1911-2,11.99

Cedric.  Cheek, you mean.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.100

But then of Course, I <font> am <$$font> supposed to have a bit of nerve,
BENNETT-1911-2,11.101

Well, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} settled.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.102

We are to travel, then.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.103

Flora.  The point is, where?  BENNETT-1911-2,11.104

Cedric.  Where would you like?  BENNETT-1911-2,11.105

Flora.  <paren> <font> Radiantly.  <$$font> <$$paren> Anywhere
{COM:"any"_in_italics}.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.106

Cedric.  What about Paris?  BENNETT-1911-2,11.107

Flora.  Oh, not Paris.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.108

Cedric.  Why not?  BENNETT-1911-2,11.109

Flora.  We should be simply mobbed.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.110

My dearest boy, have you ever heard speak of the simplicity of genius?
BENNETT-1911-2,11.111

Cedric.  I seem to have read about it somewhere, perhaps in the ladies'
papers.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.112

Flora.  Well, you $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} understand it, because $you $'ve
{TEXT:you've} got it - acutely.  BENNETT-1911-2,11.113

Cedric.  And here all these years $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} been taking myself
for rather a crafty person!  BENNETT-1911-2,11.114

Flora.  Do you know how many times $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} counted your
portrait in the weeklies this year?  BENNETT-1911-2,11.115

One hundred and forty-six!  BENNETT-1911-2,11.116

And <P_12> $that $'s {TEXT:that's} not reckoning the pictures where your
$aeroplane $'s {TEXT:aeroplane's} so high up that you only look like a
fly in a mouse-trap.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.117

Cedric.  In my simple mind $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} always thought that the
surest way never to be recognised in the street was to have your portrait
in the papers.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.118

Flora.  And then $there $'s {TEXT:there's} your likeness to your mother!
BENNETT-1911-2,12.119

A hundred and fifty-one thousand copies of your dear mother's last novel
sold up to yesterday - BENNETT-1911-2,12.120

so I saw in the"Telegraph.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.121

"And then her new novel out today!  BENNETT-1911-2,12.122

Cedric.  $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not suggesting that we should camp out in
Piccadilly for our honeymoon, my dove and my love; BENNETT-1911-2,12.123

I said Paris.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.124

Flora.  All London will be in Paris.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.125

Cedric.  What - next week?  BENNETT-1911-2,12.126

Flora.  Every week.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.127

Excuse me asking a pointed question, dearest, BENNETT-1911-2,12.128

but have you ever been to Paris - I mean, since the flood?
BENNETT-1911-2,12.129

Cedric.  Yes.  My knowledge of the unwieldy goods department of the big
railway stations is probably matchless.  BENNETT-1911-2,12.130

Flora.  Well, if $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} stepped outside the stations $you
$'d {TEXT:you'd} know that Paris is now exclusively inhabited by nice
respectable people from London and nice respectable people from Arizona;
BENNETT-1911-2,12.131

and when they $are $n't {TEXT:aren't} cricking their necks to look at
aeroplanes, $they $'re {TEXT:they're} <P_13> improving their minds with
your dear mother's latest novel.  BENNETT-1911-2,13.132

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Mock serious.  <$$font> <$$paren> Will you
believe me - BENNETT-1911-2,13.133

$I $'d {TEXT:I'd} no notion of this at all!  BENNETT-1911-2,13.134

Flora.  I tell you what - BENNETT-1911-2,13.135

I $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} mind going to Paris under an assumed name.
BENNETT-1911-2,13.136

Cedric.  Oh, no!  BENNETT-1911-2,13.137

Flora.  Why not?  BENNETT-1911-2,13.138

It would be amusing.  BENNETT-1911-2,13.139

Cedric.  I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} see myself travelling under a false name.
BENNETT-1911-2,13.140

I suppose I am too English.  BENNETT-1911-2,13.141

Flora.  Well, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} see myself in a Paris hotel as the
bride of the most celebrated English aviator, and the daughter-in-law
of the most celebrated English lady-novelist.  BENNETT-1911-2,13.142

I do not!  BENNETT-1911-2,13.143

<paren> <font> With a characteristic gesture.  <$$font> <$$paren>
Mobbed $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} the word for what we should be.
BENNETT-1911-2,13.144

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Gazing at her.  <$$font> <$$paren> You must
have noticed that $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not what $you $'d {TEXT:you'd}
call gushing; BENNETT-1911-2,13.145

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} known myself go for a month without using a single
superlative; BENNETT-1911-2,13.146

but really, my most dear girl, my Fluffiest, when you strike an attitude
like that, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} more marvellously and ineffably
adorable than ever.  BENNETT-1911-2,13.147

Your beauty, your charm, your enormous slap-upness - BENNETT-1911-2,13.148

<paren> <font> changing his tone <$$font> <$$paren> - Well, ecstasy is
not my line...  BENNETT-1911-2,13.149

I only said Paris because the mater asked me if I thought we should be
going there, and I told her it was possible.  BENNETT-1911-2,13.150

Flora.  Will <font> she <$$font> be there?  BENNETT-1911-2,13.151

<P_14>

Cedric.  No, no!  Only, if we <font> should <$$font> happen to go there,
she wanted me to count the panes of glass in a lamp-post on the Alexander
III. bridge.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.153

One of her realistic details, you know.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.154

I expect $she $'s {TEXT:she's} got her hero staring absently up at that
lamp-post - after an indiscreet evening...  BENNETT-1911-2,14.155

She may be depending on me.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.156

Flora.  But surely that $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} a reason why we should go
to Paris!  BENNETT-1911-2,14.157

Your dear mother might have wanted to know the number of ribs in the
umbrella of the King of Siam - BENNETT-1911-2,14.158

should we have had to book to Bangkok?  BENNETT-1911-2,14.159

Cedric.  I was only - BENNETT-1911-2,14.160

Flora.  Husband, I must tell you something about your mother.
BENNETT-1911-2,14.161

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} kept it a secret from you.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.162

Do you know what made her give up her terrific scheme of our being
married in the cathedral by the Bishop, surrounded by the press of Europe?
BENNETT-1911-2,14.163

Cedric.  I thought our angel-tongues persuaded her out of it.
BENNETT-1911-2,14.164

Flora.  Not at all.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.165

A threat did it.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.166

I dropped in on her one day for a little private chat while you were
at Blackpool.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.167

She was just going to arrange with the Bishop.  BENNETT-1911-2,14.168

I told her confidentially - but of course <font> nicely <$$font> -
that if she $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} agree to us being married by a
curate at Colchester, with nobody but her and your father and Charlie
present, and nothing whatever in the papers for at least a fortnight
, <P_15> then I should insist on being married at a registry office.
BENNETT-1911-2,15.169

Cedric.  The deuce you did!  BENNETT-1911-2,15.170

What did she say?  BENNETT-1911-2,15.171

Flora.  She merely said:"Of course your wish is our law, Mrs.
Lloyd. "BENNETT-1911-2,15.172

But the next day she was calling me"Flora"again.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.173

Cedric.  The mater folded up like that?  BENNETT-1911-2,15.174

Flora.  There!  <paren> <font> Laughing.  <$$font> <$$paren> Listen to
your own tone, dearest.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.175

Naturally she folded up.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.176

She only needs proper treatment.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.177

Cedric.  Well, I had a bit of a stir with her when I decided to give up
my amateur status; BENNETT-1911-2,15.178

but I must say as a rule I get on very well with the mater.
BENNETT-1911-2,15.179

Flora.  So do I.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.180

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} because I get on so well with her that we had a
curate to-day instead of the Bishop.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.181

Rather a jolly curate, $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} you think?
BENNETT-1911-2,15.182

Cedric.  Struck me as a queer lot.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.183

Flora.  Of course $they $'re {TEXT:they're} all queer.
BENNETT-1911-2,15.184

I liked him because when he asked me to sign my name he $did $n't
{TEXT:didn't} say <paren> <font> imitating the snigger of a curate
<$$font> <$$paren>"for the last time,"BENNETT-1911-2,15.185

They always do, you know.  BENNETT-1911-2,15.186

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} almost part of the service, for them.
BENNETT-1911-2,15.187

And if he had said it, I do believe I should have screamed.
BENNETT-1911-2,15.188

Cedric.  I say, Fluff, why after hiding this secret for several weeks -
$it $'s {TEXT:it's} practically a double life that $you $'ve {TEXT:you've}
been leading - BENNETT-1911-2,15.189

why <P_16> do you reveal it just at this particular moment?
BENNETT-1911-2,16.190

Flora.  Oh - sheer caprice, my dearest!  BENNETT-1911-2,16.191

It just popped into my head.  BENNETT-1911-2,16.192

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Somewhat troubled and awkward.  <$$font> <$$paren>
So your notion is that the mater's moral empire over her family and
the British public might be checked without grave loss of life, eh?
BENNETT-1911-2,16.193

Flora.  Cedric!  BENNETT-1911-2,16.194

<paren> Cedric <font> looks at her, arrested and questioning.  <$$font>
<$$paren> $What $'s {TEXT:What's} the rarest thing in the world?  Quick?
BENNETT-1911-2,16.195

Cedric.  Common-sense, of course.  BENNETT-1911-2,16.196

Flora.  Oh!  Good!  BENNETT-1911-2,16.197

I was afraid you might say a well-cooked potato.  BENNETT-1911-2,16.198

Cedric.  You ought to know me better than that.  BENNETT-1911-2,16.199

Flora.  But, Cedric, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} only now that $we
$'re {TEXT:we're} beginning to make each other's acquaintance.
BENNETT-1911-2,16.200

Cedric.  $That $'s {TEXT:That's} true!  BENNETT-1911-2,16.201

But how did <font> you <$$font> know that common-sense is the rarest
thing in the world?  BENNETT-1911-2,16.202

Flora.  Because $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} got so very little of it myself.
BENNETT-1911-2,16.203

But even a very little will go a long way.  BENNETT-1911-2,16.204

Now, have I told you that our marriage $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} going to
be like ordinary marriages - BENNETT-1911-2,16.205

I mean, really?  BENNETT-1911-2,16.206

Cedric.  Well, you $have $n't {TEXT:haven't} exactly told me,
BENNETT-1911-2,16.207

but $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} allowed me to suspect the fact.
BENNETT-1911-2,16.208

Flora.  Most marriages, and especially most <P_17> honeymoons,
are third-rate simply because the people concerned in them $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} bring their bit of common-sense to bear on the problems
that are <paren> <font> mock platform manner <$$font> <$$paren> - er -
continually arising.  BENNETT-1911-2,17.209

<paren> <font> Laughing.  <$$font> <$$paren> I intend to keep my bit of
common-sense healthy by constant exercise.  BENNETT-1911-2,17.210

Common-sense, steadily applied, will solve any problem.
BENNETT-1911-2,17.211

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Emphatically.  <$$font> <$$paren> Any!
BENNETT-1911-2,17.212

BENNETT-1911-2,17.214

Cedric.  My dear, in this outpouring of wisdom I, too, must have my share.
BENNETT-1911-2,17.215

Common-sense will solve any problem - any!  - always provided it is
employed simultaneously with politeness.  BENNETT-1911-2,17.216

During a long and varied career as a bachelor, dear spouse <paren>
<font> mock platform manner <$$font> <$$paren>, I have noticed that
marriage is usually the death of politeness between a man and a woman.
BENNETT-1911-2,17.217

I have noticed that the stronger the passion the weaker the manners.
BENNETT-1911-2,17.218

Now, my theory is that politeness, instead of decreasing with intimacy -
should increase!  BENNETT-1911-2,17.219

And when I say"politeness"I mean common, superficial politeness.
BENNETT-1911-2,17.220

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mean the deep-down sort of thing that you can

Flora.  Cedric!  <paren> <font> Impulsively rushes to him and

BENNETT-1911-2,17.223

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} <P_18> exactly what $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} been thinking

Now, as to common-sense and the programme.  It would be
against common-sense for us to begin by annoying your mother.
BENNETT-1911-2,18.225

If you really do think your mother would be in the least upset
by our not going to Paris, naturally I shall be delighted to go.
BENNETT-1911-2,18.226

We could stop just long enough to inspect the lamp-post - and then

BENNETT-1911-2,18.232

Cedric.  My dearest, your life shall be saved regardless of cost.
BENNETT-1911-2,18.233

Flora.  I do want an expensive honeymoon.  Not because $I $'m {TEXT:I'm}

BENNETT-1911-2,18.234

Cedric.  A symbol.  BENNETT-1911-2,18.235

Flora.  A symbol.  BENNETT-1911-2,18.236

And it ought to be done - well, adequately.  BENNETT-1911-2,18.237

Cedric.  Nineteen thousand pounds odd of mine is now on deposit at my
bank - all honestly taken by me out of the pockets of ratepayers of
various important towns in less than a year.  BENNETT-1911-2,18.238

And when $that $'s {TEXT:that's} gone I can always get more at about

BENNETT-1911-2,19.241

Cedric.  Certainly not!  BENNETT-1911-2,19.242

Flora.  And it is to last a full month, naturally.  BENNETT-1911-2,19.243

Cedric.  A full calendar month - with no address: for letters.

No one could suspect that we $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't} been <font> born

Gaston.  <paren> <font> After looking at <$$font> Flora <font> in the

One would say it was a crime in England.  BENNETT-1911-2,20.269

A young man and young lady in English hotel - they like better that one

It is different in Switzerland.  BENNETT-1911-2,20.271

Very valuable.  BENNETT-1911-2,21.295

When I come to London I could not speak English - no!
BENNETT-1911-2,21.296

Cedric.  When was that?  BENNETT-1911-2,21.297

Last week?  BENNETT-1911-2,21.298

Gaston.  No.  It is a year, nearly.  BENNETT-1911-2,21.299

But I had at once a situation, the first day, at the Grand Babylon Hotel.

Cedric.  Rather awkward, $was $n't {TEXT:wasn't} it, not knowing English?
BENNETT-1911-2,21.301

Herr Klopstock, who has already, we understand, taken the whole of a

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} bound to do a lot of corkscrewing to get up,
BENNETT-1911-2,27.442

and nothing less than six thousand feet would be safe.
BENNETT-1911-2,27.443

Flora.  <paren> <font> With a gesture dismissing all that.  <$$font>
<$$paren> Well, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think $it $'s {TEXT:it's} quite
nice of Mr. Klop-stock.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.444

It ought to have occurred to him.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.445

But then, it never does seem to occur to Germans...  BENNETT-1911-2,27.446

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} often noticed that in hotels.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.447

They $do $n't {TEXT:don't} seem to perceive.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.448

<paren> <font> Different tone.  <$$font> <$$paren> Will he succeed?
BENNETT-1911-2,27.449

Cedric.  He <font> might.  <$$font> BENNETT-1911-2,27.450

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think he would; not with his present horse-power
; BENNETT-1911-2,27.451

but he just might.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.452

Flora.  Well, most probably he $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}.
BENNETT-1911-2,27.453

And then you can try in July as you originally intended, and get the
money after all.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.454

Then there will have been some <font> sense <$$font> in the prize, anyway.
BENNETT-1911-2,27.455

Cedric.  It $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} the money.  BENNETT-1911-2,27.456

Flora.  Surely it $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} the mountain?
BENNETT-1911-2,27.457

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Following his own thought.  <$$font> <$$paren>
$We $'ve {TEXT:We've} got to come out on top in this business.
BENNETT-1911-2,27.458

I <P_28> must get to business in the middle of next week.
BENNETT-1911-2,28.459

$It $'ll {TEXT:It'll} take a day to modify those wing-tips, and another
to tune her up.  BENNETT-1911-2,28.460

Oh!  I shall be ready long before he is.  BENNETT-1911-2,28.461

But $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} give him a chance to get nicely installed in
his hotel.  BENNETT-1911-2,28.462

I should like Herr Klopstock and his crew to admire the beautiful scenery.
BENNETT-1911-2,28.463

Flora.  <paren> <font> Casually.  <$$font> <$$paren> You must be at the
works next week?  BENNETT-1911-2,28.464

Cedric.  $It $'s {TEXT:It's} me or nobody!  BENNETT-1911-2,28.465

No use trying to disguise that fact, Fluff!  BENNETT-1911-2,28.466

Flora.  Perhaps in the heat of the moment $you $'ve {TEXT:you've}
forgotten that you happened to get married this morning, Cedric.
BENNETT-1911-2,28.467

Cedric.  I wish we $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't} happened to get married
this morning.  BENNETT-1911-2,28.468

<paren> <font> She looks at him.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,28.469

I mean, I wish $we $'d {TEXT:we'd} happened to get married a week ago.
BENNETT-1911-2,28.470

Frantic nuisance!  BENNETT-1911-2,28.471

However, There you are!  BENNETT-1911-2,28.472

It simply means we shall be fixed up a bit sooner in the flat -
BENNETT-1911-2,28.473

Flora.  But the flat $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} be anything like ready by
next week.  BENNETT-1911-2,28.474

Cedric.  Never mind, BENNETT-1911-2,28.475

$we $'ll {TEXT:we'll} sleep at the Grand Babylon, or in the backyard.
BENNETT-1911-2,28.476

<paren> <font> A little pause.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,28.477

Of course as a nuisance it completely baffles description...  To-day of
all days...  BENNETT-1911-2,28.478

However, Fluff, as I said before with profound truth - here you are!
BENNETT-1911-2,28.479

It would never do in this world to give the German lot even a chance.
BENNETT-1911-2,28.480

The $thing $'s {TEXT:thing's} too spectacular - altogether too <P_29>
spectacular.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.481

If it was a question of beating us quietly and for ever in technics or
manufacture, the B.P.  $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} think twice about it;
BENNETT-1911-2,29.482

but Snowdon is Snowdon, BENNETT-1911-2,29.483

and a black eagle is a black eagle, BENNETT-1911-2,29.484

and <paren> <font> comically <$$font> <$$paren> in short, madam, England
will turn to your husband in its hour of peril.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.485

In other words, Fluff, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} up to me.
BENNETT-1911-2,29.486

Flora.  <paren> <font> Lightly <$$font> <$$paren> I say, Cedric.
BENNETT-1911-2,29.487

Cedric.  Well?  BENNETT-1911-2,29.488

Flora.  I thought we were agreed about a full calendar month.
BENNETT-1911-2,29.489

Cedric.  <paren> <font> After a pause; as lightly as possible.
<$$font> <$$paren> Do you mean you think I ought to let Snowdon slide?
BENNETT-1911-2,29.490

Do you really - BENNETT-1911-2,29.491

Flora.  Yes, of course.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.492

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you?  BENNETT-1911-2,29.493

Cedric.  You $are $n't {TEXT:aren't} serious?  BENNETT-1911-2,29.494

Flora.  <paren> <font> Persuasively.  <$$font> <$$paren> My dearest boy,
is there any reason why I $should $n't {TEXT:shouldn't} differ from you
and yet be serious?  BENNETT-1911-2,29.495

Cedric.  No, of course not.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.496

But in a case like this - if there was anybody else to take my place,
I $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} mind.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.497

Of course Smith-James could do it if only he would use our machine -
BENNETT-1911-2,29.498

but he $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.499

Nothing would induce him to.  BENNETT-1911-2,29.500

So as I keep on saying - there you are!  BENNETT-1911-2,29.501

Flora.  But what does it matter?  BENNETT-1911-2,29.502

Is it because the other man's machine has been called the Black Eagle
in a telegram that you - BENNETT-1911-2,29.503

<P_30>

Cedric.  Yes, partly.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.505

Flora.  Oh!  So that If this canvas-backed duck flies first over a lump
of mud called Snowdon - BENNETT-1911-2,30.506

Cedric.  But $do $n't {TEXT:don't} I tell you Snowdon is the highest
mountain in England?  BENNETT-1911-2,30.507

Flora.  No, it $is $n't {TEXT:isn't}.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.508

Cedric.  Pardon me.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.509

Three thousand five hundred and seventy feet.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.510

The next highest is - BENNETT-1911-2,30.511

Flora.  Well, you go BENNETT-1911-2,30.512

and tell Lloyd George that Snowdon is the highest mountain in England,
BENNETT-1911-2,30.513

and see what $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} get.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.514

Cedric.  Wales, then.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.515

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} all the same.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.516

Flora.  <paren> <font> With great charm.  <$$font> <$$paren> If $you
$'re {TEXT:you're} thinking of the ten thousand pounds, I $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} mind informing you, as a great secret, that I $would $n't
{TEXT:wouldn't} sell a single day of my honeymoon with you for ten times
ten thousand pounds.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.517

But I told you I wanted an expensive honeymoon, $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} I?
BENNETT-1911-2,30.518

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Shaking his head and with calm certainty.
<$$font> <$$paren> The money $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} influence me
that much!  BENNETT-1911-2,30.519

<paren> <font> Snaps his fingers.  <$$font> <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,30.520

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} wish to flatter myself, BENNETT-1911-2,30.521

but I think I could light your cigarette with a bank note as gracefully
as anybody.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.522

No - BENNETT-1911-2,30.523

Flora.  $You $'re {TEXT:You're} pulling away at that cigar of yours,
BENNETT-1911-2,30.524

but I suppose you know it $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} lighted.
BENNETT-1911-2,30.525

Cedric.  $Is $n't {TEXT:Isn't} it?  BENNETT-1911-2,30.526

<paren> <font> As he lights the cigar.  <$$font> <$$paren> No!
This Snowdon business.  BENNETT-1911-2,30.527

Well, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a <P_31> symbol <paren> <font> half to himself
<$$font> <$$paren>.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.528

I wonder how I can make you understand that.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.529

Flora.  <paren> <font> Fascinatingly.  <$$font> <$$paren> Oh!  Force is
unnecessary, BENNETT-1911-2,31.530

I understand that.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.531

But who was it said just now that the honeymoon was a symbol?
BENNETT-1911-2,31.532

It stands for all our married life.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.533

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} the most exciting and interesting time we shall
ever have.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.534

And you $can $n't {TEXT:can't} put a honeymoon off, you know.
BENNETT-1911-2,31.535

It $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} like a box of cigars that you can keep in
a cupboard and enjoy one of them every now and then when $you $'ve
{TEXT:you've} got a few minutes to spare.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.536

It must happen now or never.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.537

You $can $n't {TEXT:can't} postpone it.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.538

You can only kill it.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.539

<paren> <font> Smiles lightly.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,31.540

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Taking hold of her, in a caressing tone.  <$$font>
<$$paren> $She $'s {TEXT:She's} tragic!  BENNETT-1911-2,31.541

Flora.  <paren> <font> Disengaging herself'.  <$$font> <$$paren> Oh, no!
BENNETT-1911-2,31.542

Cedric.  Now just listen to me, Fluff.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.543

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} really thinking at least as much of you as of myself.
BENNETT-1911-2,31.544

This affair is bound to have an influence on my career.
BENNETT-1911-2,31.545

Flora.  And what about its influence on mine?  BENNETT-1911-2,31.546

Cedric.  Same thing.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.547

I suppose our interests are identical.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.548

Flora.  My poor simple boy, do you really believe that?
BENNETT-1911-2,31.549

Cedric.  Well, dash it, BENNETT-1911-2,31.550

$are $n't {TEXT:aren't} you my wife?  BENNETT-1911-2,31.551

Flora.  So far as $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} concerned, it would be more correct
to say that $you $'re {TEXT:you're} my husband.  BENNETT-1911-2,31.552

In fact, $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} got a career as my husband.
BENNETT-1911-2,31.553

<P_32>

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Anxious to be fair.  <$$font> <$$paren> Certainly.
And you as my wife.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.555

But - BENNETT-1911-2,32.556

Flora.  One second, dearest.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.557

$You $'re {TEXT:You're} unique as an aviator, $are $n't {TEXT:aren't} you?
BENNETT-1911-2,32.558

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Conventionally modest.  <$$font> <$$paren> Oh -
well - BENNETT-1911-2,32.559

Flora.  Now.  Man to man.  Give your modesty a rest.
BENNETT-1911-2,32.560

Really, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you consider $you $'ve {TEXT:you've}
proved yourself unique in your line?  BENNETT-1911-2,32.561

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Hesitatingly, chivalrously.  <$$font> <$$paren>
I suppose $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} just about as unique in my line as you are
in yours, my dear.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.562

Flora.  NOW $that $'s {TEXT:that's} very nice of you.
BENNETT-1911-2,32.563

Cedric.  Not at all.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.564

Flora.  Yes, it is, because $it $'s {TEXT:it's} exactly what I wanted
you to say.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.565

$You $'ve {TEXT:You've} often said that $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} unique,
BENNETT-1911-2,32.566

and I just wanted you to say it again at this identical particular
instant.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.567

Of course I could have reminded you of it, BENNETT-1911-2,32.568

but that $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} have been quite so effective.
BENNETT-1911-2,32.569

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} why $it $'s {TEXT:it's} very nice of you.
BENNETT-1911-2,32.570

Cedric.  So you are unique - BENNETT-1911-2,32.571

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} say it as often as you like.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.572

Flora.  I warn you, BENNETT-1911-2,32.573

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} giving yourself away.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.574

Cedric.  Delighted!  BENNETT-1911-2,32.575

Flora.  I $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} care to repeat all the lovely
adjectives $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} used about me.  BENNETT-1911-2,32.576

If you $were $n't {TEXT:weren't} such a determined enemy of gush and
superlatives - people might suspect that sometimes you exaggerated the
tiniest bit when <P_33> you talked about me, <font> to <$$font> me.
BENNETT-1911-2,33.577

But of course <font> I <$$font> know you never do exaggerate, at any
rate consciously, BENNETT-1911-2,33.578

and <font> you <$$font> know $you $'re {TEXT:you're} a very good judge.
BENNETT-1911-2,33.579

Cedric.  What of?  BENNETT-1911-2,33.580

Flora.  Us!  BENNETT-1911-2,33.581

...  Now look here, Cedric, BENNETT-1911-2,33.582

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} you think it would be a pity to stop this creature
, who is so unique in her line, from giving a full exhibition of her
unique powers at a unique moment; at the very height of her career.
BENNETT-1911-2,33.583

You know, $she $'ll {TEXT:she'll} never have another opportunity like this
of proving that she really is unique in her line.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.584

Cedric.  What do you call her line?  BENNETT-1911-2,33.585

$Let $'s {TEXT:Let's} be clear.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.586

Flora.  <paren> <font> Quietly, off-handedly, after a pause.  <$$font>
<$$paren> To charm.  Merely that.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.587

Cedric.  By God!  She can do that.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.588

But <paren> <font> winningly, but half to himself <$$font> <$$paren> ,
I hardly know how to put it.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.589

Flora.  I think you do, dearest; BENNETT-1911-2,33.590

but $you $'re {TEXT:you're} so nice, you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like to.
BENNETT-1911-2,33.591

You wanted to make a comparison between the importance of your line and
the importance of mine.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.592

I admit all that.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.593

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} quite humble.  BENNETT-1911-2,33.594

I fully admit that if Hyde Park were full of aviators and Battersea Park
were full of charming young women, rather pretty and - er - chic - <paren>
<font> gesture to show off her frock <$$font> <$$paren> - I fully admit
that not a man among you would ever <font> dream - <$$font> of <P_34>
crossing the river.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.595

I fully admit that if every aviator in Europe gave up business to-morrow
the entire world would go into mourning, whereas if all the charming
women retired from business $they $'d {TEXT:they'd} never be missed.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.596

Still - BENNETT-1911-2,34.597

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Appreciative.  <$$font> <$$paren> $You $'re
{TEXT:You're} a witty girl - BENNETT-1911-2,34.598

Flora.  $We $'re {TEXT:We're} both rather witty, $are $n't {TEXT:aren't}
we, at times?  BENNETT-1911-2,34.599

Cedric.  But the fact is I $was $n't {TEXT:wasn't} going to make any
comparison at all between our respective lines.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.600

I was only going to point out that you can keep on being charming all
the time.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.601

$You $'re {TEXT:You're} always charming; BENNETT-1911-2,34.602

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} always doing <font> your <$$font> line.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.603

Whereas for my line.  I have to choose times and seasons - or rather I
$do $n't {TEXT:don't} choose'em, $they $'re {TEXT:they're} chosen for me,
as, for instance, just now.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.604

Wherever we are, honeymoon or no honeymoon, $you $'re {TEXT:you're}
- well, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} giving an exhibition flight.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.605

Flora.  Now, Cedric, your good $nature $'s {TEXT:nature's} getting the
better of your sincerity.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.606

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not always charming.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.607

Ask your dear mother.  BENNETT-1911-2,34.608

And have you forgotten our historic shindy about the length of your
moustache scarcely three months ago?  BENNETT-1911-2,34.609

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} <font> not <$$font> always charming.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.610

And I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} <font> want <$$font> to be always charming.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.611

Who would?  BENNETT-1911-2,34.612

As for exhibition flights, $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} never seen me give one.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.613

You think you have, BENNETT-1911-2,34.614

but what $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} seen up to now is nothing.
BENNETT-1911-2,34.615

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind telling you that I had <P_35>
arranged a rather sensational exhibition flight for the next month.
BENNETT-1911-2,35.616

It would last just thirty-one days.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.617

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind telling you that $I $'ve {TEXT:I've}
thought a good deal about it, and made all my elaborate preparations.
BENNETT-1911-2,35.618

It really would be a pity to interfere with it.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.619

And you know it $can $n't {TEXT:can't} be postponed.
BENNETT-1911-2,35.620

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} choose time and season any more than you do.
BENNETT-1911-2,35.621

Cedric.  But surely, Fluff, this flight can proceed, as I say, wherever
we are?  BENNETT-1911-2,35.622

Flora.  You think so?  BENNETT-1911-2,35.623

And what about my grandstand?  BENNETT-1911-2,35.624

Cedric.  I shall always be your grandstand.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.625

Flora.  Shall you?  BENNETT-1911-2,35.626

I can only do my best when $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} got the undivided attention
of my audience.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.627

I hope I should never come <font> quite <$$font> to earth,
BENNETT-1911-2,35.628

but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} see myself being unique in my line for the
benefit of a man who is busy <paren> <font> with the faintest touch of
irony in her tone <$$font> <$$paren> counting the misfires in his motor,
or dreaming about the barometer.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.629

Cedric.  Naturally, if you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} see the importance of
this Snowdon business to us - BENNETT-1911-2,35.630

Flora.  <paren> <font> Consciously very charming again.  <$$font>
<$$paren> But I do see it perfectly well.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.631

A woman unique in her own line is not necessarily a gaping idiot in
every other line.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.632

I admit the immense importance of Snowdon to us.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.633

I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} argue.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.634

In my time $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} been told that I was too well-dressed to
be able to argue.  BENNETT-1911-2,35.635

I simply <P_36> want to ask you this - what, for you, is the <font>
most <$$font> important thing in life?  BENNETT-1911-2,36.636

Now, $let $'s {TEXT:let's} be straight.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.637

Have you married as a supreme end, BENNETT-1911-2,36.638

or is your supreme end to move yourself about in the air without visible

and be a man.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.641

Cedric.  $You $'re {TEXT:You're} putting very fundamental questions.
BENNETT-1911-2,36.642

Flora.  Is marriage a relaxation from flying, BENNETT-1911-2,36.643

or do you fly in order to have the means for practising the whole art
of marriage under favourable conditions?  BENNETT-1911-2,36.644

Do you live most intensely when $you $'re {TEXT:you're} battling with
the breeze, or when $you $'re {TEXT:you're} <paren> <font> dropping her
voice <$$font> <$$paren> with me?  BENNETT-1911-2,36.645

I only want to know.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.646

Because if you live most intensely when $you $'re {TEXT:you're} with
me, this honeymoon should be worth more to us than forty Snowdons.
BENNETT-1911-2,36.647

Cedric.  <paren> <font> A little coldly.  <$$font> <$$paren> Say no more,
BENNETT-1911-2,36.648

Snowdon is chucked.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.649

Of course, my position is impossible.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.650

You have only to insist.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.651

Flora.  <paren> <font> Losing her self-control.  <$$font> <$$paren>
Insist?  BENNETT-1911-2,36.652

<font> Insist <$$font> that you neglect an aeroplane so that you can
stay with me?  BENNETT-1911-2,36.653

My dear boy, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} incapable of taking such a mean advantage
of, an aeroplane.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.654

An aeroplane $can $n't {TEXT:can't} insist.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.655

And I can assure you I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't}.  BENNETT-1911-2,36.656

Cedric.  Do you know that $you $'re {TEXT:you're} scarcely logical?
BENNETT-1911-2,36.657

<P_37>

Flora.  Not logical?  In not insisting?  BENNETT-1911-2,37.659

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Somewhat at a loss.  <$$font> <$$paren> I mean
generally.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.660

For instance, when we began, your first argument was that we $could
$n't {TEXT:couldn't} shorten the honeymoon because the flat $would $n't
{TEXT:wouldn't} be ready.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.661

Flora.  One $can $n't {TEXT:can't} think of everything at once.
BENNETT-1911-2,37.662

You $must $n't {TEXT:mustn't} forget $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} never been
called to the bar.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.663

If $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} known what was coming, no doubt I should have
prepared my case and had it typewritten, and sent copies to the press...
BENNETT-1911-2,37.664

And then what about your being illogical?  BENNETT-1911-2,37.665

Cedric.  Me?  BENNETT-1911-2,37.666

Flora.  Yes.  When I ask you for a straight answer you protest that $I
$'m {TEXT:I'm} putting very fundamental questions.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.667

Did you expect me to put shallow questions?  BENNETT-1911-2,37.668

Did you expect me to enquire whether $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} used Pears'
soap?  BENNETT-1911-2,37.669

Cedric.  Now look here, Fluffiest - BENNETT-1911-2,37.670

Flora.  <paren> <font> Angry.  <$$font> <$$paren> Cedric, I wish you

$You $'ve {TEXT:You've} only started it since we were married.
BENNETT-1911-2,37.672

I can stand Fluff, BENNETT-1911-2,37.673

but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like Fluffy, BENNETT-1911-2,37.674

and my objection to Fluffiest is intense.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.675

Cedric.  I beg your pardon.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.676

Flora.  <paren> <font> Recovering herself, sweetly.  <$$font> <$$paren>
$It $'s {TEXT:It's} I who beg yours.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.677

For the moment I was forgetting that"common superficial politeness"
which you ranked with common-sense.  BENNETT-1911-2,37.678

<P_38>

Cedric.  My dear child, $everything $'s {TEXT:everything's} all right.
BENNETT-1911-2,38.680

The honeymoon shall not be shortened by a single day.
BENNETT-1911-2,38.681

$Everything $'s {TEXT:Everything's} absolutely all right.
BENNETT-1911-2,38.682

Flora.  <paren> <font> Shakes her head.  <$$font> <$$paren>

BENNETT-1911-2,38.686

Flora.  Cedric.  Honestly.  Yes or no.  BENNETT-1911-2,38.687

Cedric.  <paren> <font> They look at each other.  <$$font> <$$paren>

Flora.  <paren> <font> Agreeing.  <$$font> <$$paren> No.  Such questions

But human nature is so - human, that probably it $would $n't

They might even be considered rude.  BENNETT-1911-2,38.692

This is a nice kind idea of yours, to come and relieve our solitude,

Mrs. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Sits.  <$$font> <$$paren>
Believe me, Flora, I never felt so unequal to a situation in my life.
BENNETT-1911-2,40.742

Cedric.  Look here, dad, do you mind telling me in one word what this
is all about?  BENNETT-1911-2,40.743

<P_41>

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Yes, your father will tell you.
BENNETT-1911-2,41.745

The circumstances are exceedingly difficult - in fact, painful.
BENNETT-1911-2,41.746

But they have to be faced, and faced with dignity.  BENNETT-1911-2,41.747

The various necessary steps must be taken, in their proper order,
very carefully.  BENNETT-1911-2,41.748

The first step is to inform you and Flora of the facts.
BENNETT-1911-2,41.749

Your father will inform you; BENNETT-1911-2,41.750

as the head of the family, and the fount of authority, the statement
comes more properly from him.  BENNETT-1911-2,41.751

I decided that absolutely as we motored down.  BENNETT-1911-2,41.752

<paren> <font> To <$$font> Mr. Reach Haslam.  <$$paren> Dear -

<paren> <font> To <$$font> Cedric <font> and <$$font> Flora.  <$$paren>
You know we went straight back to town when $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} left

Cedric <font> and <$$font> Flora.  <$$paren> You $need $n't {TEXT:needn't}

As I said, the circumstances are painful, BENNETT-1911-2,41.758

but once faced as we shall face them, they really amount to nothing.
BENNETT-1911-2,41.759

The principal thing was to catch you in time.  BENNETT-1911-2,41.760

Thank heaven, $we $'ve {TEXT:we've} done that!  BENNETT-1911-2,41.761

Charles.  Thank my masterly and audacious driving!  BENNETT-1911-2,41.762

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Never mind all that.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.766

Do it as gently as you can, BENNETT-1911-2,42.767

but come to the point at once.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.768

I am quite sure that is best.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.769

Mr. R. Haslam.  The telephone?  BENNETT-1911-2,42.770

Mrs. R. Haslam.  The telephone.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.771

Mr. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Nodding to her
politely.  <$$paren> <$$font> We were rung up on the telephone.
BENNETT-1911-2,42.772

Your mother was walking about in meditation, BENNETT-1911-2,42.773

and as she was nearest to the telephone she answered it.
BENNETT-1911-2,42.774

She then said to me,"$It $'s {TEXT:It's} the Bishop of Colchester.
"BENNETT-1911-2,42.775

I was at the desk.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.776

In another moment she asked me to come to the telephone and listen for
myself as she could scarcely believe her ears.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.777

I did so, BENNETT-1911-2,42.778

and the Bishop - he was telephoning from the Palace at Colchester -
repeated at my request what he had said to your mother, namely, that
that curate who - er - officiated this morning, suddenly awakened to a
sense of beauty - BENNETT-1911-2,42.779

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Sense of duty.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.780

Mr. R. Haslam.  I quite understood"beauty. "
BENNETT-1911-2,42.781

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} true the Bishop $has $n't {TEXT:hasn't} got a good
telephone voice - probably more impressive at a confirmation than on
the telephone.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.782

I heard"beauty. "BENNETT-1911-2,42.783

However - BENNETT-1911-2,42.784

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Sense of duty.  BENNETT-1911-2,42.785

Mr. R. Haslam.  NO doubt you are right.
BENNETT-1911-2,42.786

I <P_43> seemed to gather that it was Flora's beauty that had roused
his conscience.  BENNETT-1911-2,43.787

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Oh, no!  BENNETT-1911-2,43.788

Flora.  That had what?  BENNETT-1911-2,43.789

Charles.  <paren> <font> Coming towards the group, unable to control
his impatience.  <$$font> <$$paren> Oh, hang it!  BENNETT-1911-2,43.790

The curate was a sham curate - not a curate at all.  BENNETT-1911-2,43.791

Cedric.  <paren> <font> Taking it in.  <$$font> <$$paren> A sham curate!
BENNETT-1911-2,43.792

Flora.  But surely such things $do $n't {TEXT:don't} happen?
BENNETT-1911-2,43.793

Mrs. R. Haslam.  $That $'s {TEXT:That's} what many people
said when I made a shopwalker successfully personate an archdeacon in
"The Woman of Kent. "BENNETT-1911-2,43.794

Everyone said so until Mr. Gladstone wrote that he found the
episode quite convincing.  BENNETT-1911-2,43.795

You remember, dear?  BENNETT-1911-2,43.796

Mr. R. Haslam.  Vividly.  BENNETT-1911-2,43.797

Mrs. R. Haslam.  I assure you it happens quite frequently
that from one cause or another people who think they are married are
not married.  BENNETT-1911-2,43.798

Why, sometimes special Acts of Parliament have to be passed in order to
set things right - when $they $'ve {TEXT:they've} gone altogether too far.
BENNETT-1911-2,43.799

I well recall that when I studied this subject, as of course I did,
coming across a case in which, owing to a church having been consecrated
very carelessly, a lady who supposed herself to be the legitimate mother
of sixteen children - poor thing - BENNETT-1911-2,43.800

Flora.  <paren> <font> Interrupting.  <$$font> <$$paren> But do you mean
to say we $are $n't {TEXT:aren't} married?  BENNETT-1911-2,43.801

<P_44>

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Well, of course, I want to put it as

but the fact is <paren> <font> looking at her husband <$$font> <$$paren>.
BENNETT-1911-2,44.804

Mr. R. Haslam.  It would be an exaggeration to say that
you are married.  BENNETT-1911-2,44.805

Mrs. R. Haslam.  If my idea had been accepted of having
the Bishop to officiate - and he would have been only too enchanted
- in the cathedral, this dreadful thing could not have occurred,
BENNETT-1911-2,44.806

No case of personating a bishop has ever been known.
BENNETT-1911-2,44.807

Cedric.  But what are we to do?  BENNETT-1911-2,44.808

Charles.  <paren> <font> Airily.  <$$font> <$$paren> Well, you must make

BENNETT-1911-2,44.810

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Then it really is true?

Mrs. R. Haslam.  I know, BENNETT-1911-2,47.834

Mr. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> To whom the <$$font> Bishop
, <font> puzzled, turns for an explanation.  <$$font> <$$paren> My wife
, with her novelist's instinct, perceives the situation that would be
created if we had to <P_48> go into the drawing-room now and say to them
suddenly,"Well, you are married, after all. "BENNETT-1911-2,48.846

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Excessively delicate.  They would naturally
leave the house at once.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.847

Bishop.  Quite so.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.848

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell you how relieved I was to get your wire
saying that you had overtaken them in time.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.849

Young people make such a mystery of the honeymoon nowadays that often they
$do $n't {TEXT:don't} even leave a postal address.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.850

A dangerous innovation!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.851

Mr. R. Haslam.  Evidently.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.852

Bishop.  I gather that you have brought them both here, poor things!
BENNETT-1911-2,48.853

Mrs. R. Haslam.  It seemed the wisest course.
BENNETT-1911-2,48.854

I consulted my husband, BENNETT-1911-2,48.855

and he quite agreed with me that in view of the unusual circumstances we
ought to act with the greatest prudence - for <font> their <$$font> sakes!
BENNETT-1911-2,48.856

And so we motored quietly back to town BENNETT-1911-2,48.857

and got here just in time for dinner.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.858

My son drove.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.859

I sat by his side.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.860

There $was $n't {TEXT:wasn't} room for their heavy luggage,
BENNETT-1911-2,48.861

and so Charlie is bringing that up by train.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.862

Charles is my other son...  BENNETT-1911-2,48.863

<paren> <font> Sighs.  <$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,48.864

And here we are!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.865

Bishop.  Admirable!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.866

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} a case of - BENNETT-1911-2,48.867

Mr. R. Haslam.  As you were.  BENNETT-1911-2,48.868

Bishop.  Just so!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.869

Really a terrible blow to them - BENNETT-1911-2,48.870

must have been!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.871

And to you, and to you!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.872

An appalling shock!  BENNETT-1911-2,48.873

How have they borne it?  BENNETT-1911-2,48.874

<P_49>

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Well - <paren> <font> turning to <$$font>
Mr. R. Haslam <$$paren>.  Father, how should you say they
have borne it?  BENNETT-1911-2,49.876

Mr. R. Haslam.  Grimly.  BENNETT-1911-2,49.877

That is - on the grim side.  BENNETT-1911-2,49.878

Bishop.  Ah!  BENNETT-1911-2,49.879

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Of course, my Lord, we are taking it
for granted that the matter can be put right to-morrow, without fail,
and beyond question.  BENNETT-1911-2,49.880

I have tried to comfort them with that absolute assurance.
BENNETT-1911-2,49.881

Bishop.  My dear lady.  Without fail!  At any hour!  <font> any <$$font>
hour...  up to three o'clock.  BENNETT-1911-2,49.882

That is why I have come specially to town - to convince you by my presence
of my horror at the - er - crime, my sympathy with its innocent victims
, and my utter determination that the ceremony shall be performed
again to-morrow morning under my personal supervision and guarantee.
BENNETT-1911-2,49.883

I feel that I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do too much.  BENNETT-1911-2,49.884

<paren> <font> During the last words enter <$$font> Cuthbert, <font> back,

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Will you excuse my husband while he deals
with the post?  BENNETT-1911-2,49.886

Bishop.  I beg - BENNETT-1911-2,49.887

<paren> Mr. Reach Haslam <P_50> sits down to desk
BENNETT-1911-2,50.888

Exeunt <$$font> Servants.  <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,50.890

Mrs. R. Haslam.  I ought to apologise for receiving you
in my study, BENNETT-1911-2,50.891

but I thought - my husband thought - we had better see you first alone.
BENNETT-1911-2,50.892

Are those the press cuttings, father?  BENNETT-1911-2,50.893

<paren> Mr. Reach Haslam, <font> nodding, opens press cuttings.
<$$font> <$$paren> BENNETT-1911-2,50.894

Bishop.  But for this unfortunate <font> contretemps <$$font>, what a
charming coincidence that your new book should be published to-day of
all days!  BENNETT-1911-2,50.895

Mrs. R. Haslam.  So you find time in your busy life
, Bishop, to keep abreast of modern literature - even novels?
BENNETT-1911-2,50.896

Bishop.  <font> Even <$$font> novels!  BENNETT-1911-2,50.897

My dear lady, there is no greater force for good.  BENNETT-1911-2,50.898

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Or for evil - alas!  BENNETT-1911-2,50.899

Bishop.  Quite so!  BENNETT-1911-2,50.900

I have often thought - I have indeed said so from the platform - that
the two most truly important influences for good in our generation
are your novels and the leaflets of the National Society for Promoting
the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church.
BENNETT-1911-2,50.901

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Indeed!  BENNETT-1911-2,50.902

Father, do you recall that press-cutting?  BENNETT-1911-2,50.903

Mr. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Busy.  <$$font> <$$paren> No.
BENNETT-1911-2,50.904

<P_51>

Bishop.  It was reported in our Diocesan Magazine.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.906

Mrs. R. Haslam.  And yet, my dear Bishop, I have more than
once felt it my duty to criticise the Church rather sharply in my work.
BENNETT-1911-2,51.907

Bishop.  I know, BENNETT-1911-2,51.908

I know.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.909

We bow the head, BENNETT-1911-2,51.910

we kiss the rod.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.911

Mrs. R. Haslam.  In my new novel I am back in politics
again.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.912

Have you seen it yet?  BENNETT-1911-2,51.913

Bishop.  No, not yet.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.914

But I have already ordered it from Boot's.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.915

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Boot's?  BENNETT-1911-2,51.916

Bishop.  Yes, the cash chemists.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.917

I find their circulating library the most economical of all.
BENNETT-1911-2,51.918

And I have to be particular.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.919

As you know, I publish every year a detailed account of all my
expenditure, personal and otherwise, BENNETT-1911-2,51.920

and too large a sum for books might be misconstrued as self-indulgence,
especially in a bachelor.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.921

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Ah, yes.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.922

<paren> <font> Handing him a book.  <$$font> <$$paren> Here is a copy.
BENNETT-1911-2,51.923

Bishop.  Pretty cover.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.924

Mr. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> To his wife, in a low tone.
<$$font> <$$paren> Twenty-one columns.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.925

Mrs. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Pleased.  <$$font>
<$$paren> Really!  BENNETT-1911-2,51.926

Bishop.  <paren> <font> Looking up.  <$$font> <$$paren> Twenty-one
columns?  BENNETT-1911-2,51.927

Mrs. R. Haslam.  We are treating you without ceremony,
my dear Bishop.  BENNETT-1911-2,51.928

My husband has <P_52> just calculated the total length of the reviews
of my book that have appeared in the London papers on the first day.
BENNETT-1911-2,52.929

Of course we attach no value whatever to the actual opinions expressed -
BENNETT-1911-2,52.930

the critics have to work in such a hurry - BENNETT-1911-2,52.931

and they are so sadly unfitted for their work, poor dears -
BENNETT-1911-2,52.932

but the amount of space given is an excellent indication of the public
importance ascribed to the book.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.933

Bishop.  <paren> <font> Who has been inspecting the book.  <$$font>
<$$paren> How true!  BENNETT-1911-2,52.934

Mrs. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> To <$$font> Mr.
Reach Haslam.  <$$paren> Anything special?  BENNETT-1911-2,52.935

Mr. R. Haslam.  No.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.936

"Surpassed herself,"seven or eight times.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.937

"Masterpiece,"fourteen times.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.938

The"Piccadilly Gazette"is unfavourable.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.939

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Very?  BENNETT-1911-2,52.940

Mr. R. Haslam.  Yes.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.941

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Better tell me.  BENNETT-1911-2,52.942

<P_53>

Mrs. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Interrupting him.  <$$font>
<$$paren> Please sit down.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.950

As you are having a glimpse of me in my profession to-night, I want to
ask you one or two professional questions - about the psychology of that
false curate.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.951

Bishop.  <paren> <font> Sitting down again.  <$$font> <$$paren> Yes, yes.
BENNETT-1911-2,53.952

Psychology.  Just so.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.953

Mrs. R. Haslam.  I never lose an opportunity of gathering
material.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.954

Father, will you mind taking down?  BENNETT-1911-2,53.955

My husband is good enough to act as my stenographer.
BENNETT-1911-2,53.956

Bishop.  Touching!  BENNETT-1911-2,53.957

Mrs. Haslam.  Now I noticed nothing remarkable about that curate.
BENNETT-1911-2,53.958

Bishop.  <paren> <font> Agreeing.  <$$font> <$$paren> No.
BENNETT-1911-2,53.959

And yet, you know - curious thing - $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a gentleman,
quite!  Oh, quite!  BENNETT-1911-2,53.960

And I even remember once meeting his father, when I was Court
Chaplain, at a garden party in aid of the Additional Curates Society.
BENNETT-1911-2,53.961

Mr. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Repeating what he has
written.  <$$font> <$$paren> Curates Society.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.962

Mrs. R. Haslam.  But why should he choose to personate
a curate?  BENNETT-1911-2,53.963

That is what is so interesting to a novelist.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.964

Why a curate?  BENNETT-1911-2,53.965

It $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} have been for the money, or the glory.
BENNETT-1911-2,53.966

Mr. R. Haslam.  Glory.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.967

Bishop.  The case is highly peculiar.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.968

He is certainly not without means, or brains.  BENNETT-1911-2,53.969

My <P_54> opinion is that his action was due to excessive intellectual
curiosity.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.970

He told me he wanted to feel what it was like to be a curate.
BENNETT-1911-2,54.971

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Yet he looked quite sane.
BENNETT-1911-2,54.972

Bishop.  Oh, quite!  BENNETT-1911-2,54.973

Astonishing story!  BENNETT-1911-2,54.974

His brother, through the influence of the Primate, had been engaged as
curate, by the Vicar of St. Saviour's, Colchester, subject to
an interview.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.975

This brother had been doing some chaplaining in Switzerland - just rough
winter work.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.976

On the way home he died suddenly in Paris.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.977

Well, our friend of this morning calmly took up the dead man's identity.
BENNETT-1911-2,54.978

Came to Colchester, BENNETT-1911-2,54.979

conquered the simple Vicar, BENNETT-1911-2,54.980

and was at once accepted.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.981

That was two months ago.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.982

Mr. R. Haslam.  Ago.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.983

Mrs. R. Haslam.  But how dangerous.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.984

Bishop.  So I pointed out to him.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.985

His reply was that it was just the danger that had attracted him -
coupled with the desire to understand why the members of his family had
had such a passion for curacy.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.986

It seems that two of his sisters have espoused curates.
BENNETT-1911-2,54.987

This will be a grievous blow for all of them.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.988

Mr. R. Haslam.  All of them.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.989

Mrs. R. Haslam.  But why should the man be struck with
remorse just now?  BENNETT-1911-2,54.990

Bishop.  Well, his explanation is that he was so moved by the bride's
beauty.  BENNETT-1911-2,54.991

<P_55>

Mr. R. Haslam.  Duty.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.993

Bishop.  Beauty.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.994

<paren> <font> Gesture of mild triumph from <$$font> Mr.
Reach Haslam <font> to <$$font> Mrs. Reach Haslam.  <$$paren>
BENNETT-1911-2,55.995

He could not bear to think that any action of his should cause - er -
inconvenience to a woman so beautiful.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.996

Hence he came to me at once.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.997

Fortunately I happened to be at the Palace.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.998

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Had he performed any other marriages?
BENNETT-1911-2,55.999

Bishop.  Happily none; BENNETT-1911-2,55.1000

but he had celebrated ten funerals and four baptisms.
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1001

However, these did not seem to trouble him in the least, I regret to say.
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1002

It was the wedding alone that roused his conscience.
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1003

Mr. R. Haslam.  Conscience.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.1004

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Of course you sent for the police.
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1005

Bishop.  I trust and believe that he is now in prison.
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1006

But I did not send for the police.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.1007

The Church has its dignity to maintain against the civil judicature in
these modern days.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.1008

Also with so much irreligion - shall I say?  - flaunting in the very
air, She {COM:sic} must avoid scandal - particularly local scandal.
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1009

London scandal is less deleterious.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.1010

Accordingly I brought the young man up to town with me,
BENNETT-1911-2,55.1011

and I put him into a cab for the police-station, where he will surrender
himself of his own free will to the law.  BENNETT-1911-2,55.1012

I prefer that <P_56> way.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1013

It is, perhaps, original; BENNETT-1911-2,56.1014

but nowadays we Bishops have to be original.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1015

Mrs. R. Haslam.  But do you really suppose he has
surrendered?  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1016

Bishop.  I am sure of it.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1017

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} pretend to your skill in reading character,
dear lady, BENNETT-1911-2,56.1018

but I know a gentleman at sight.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1019

Mr. R. Haslam.  Sight.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1020

Mrs. R. Haslam.  Of course, if one put such a story into
a novel, it would never be believed.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1021

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} the worst of real life.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1022

Bishop.  And yet this distressing affair reminded me strongly of the
false archdeacon in"The Woman of Kent. "BENNETT-1911-2,56.1023

Mrs. R. Haslam.  <paren> <font> Pleased.  <$$font>
<$$paren> Ah!  You remember my early book?  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1024

Bishop.  <paren> <font> Protestingly.  <$$font> <$$paren> My dear lady!
You have no more earnest student!  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1025

And may I add that from the first I found that episode of the false
archdeacon entirely convincing.  BENNETT-1911-2,56.1026
