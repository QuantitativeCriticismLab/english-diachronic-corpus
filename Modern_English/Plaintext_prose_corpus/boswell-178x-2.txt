3 Janry. 1786 BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.4

My Dear Sir: I got well home, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.5

and found my Wife much better and my children all in good health.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.6

The Cloud was quite dispelled; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.7

nor did I meet here with any of the disagreable {COM:sic_here_and_passim}
things which I apprehended.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.8

Nay I had the satisfaction to perceive that my trial of a more enlarged
sphere was by no means condemned as irrational.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.9

So let me be content.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.10

Dilly informs me that the second edition"is welcome amongst the
trade fully to his expectation and that he conceives he shall by
the 10th be able to give a very good account of its progress. "
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.11

Should it come to a third I would venture 1500, as I suppose there will
be no more.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,280.12

<P_4,281>

Enclosed is a very handsom {COM:sic} letter from the Authour {COM:sic} of
the"Defence"of my Journal, which pray preserve.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.14

Perhaps it may be necessary to produce it publickly {COM:sic}.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.15

I have written to him.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.16

The weather is excessively cold.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.17

Lunardi is to sup with me tonight.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.18

We all join in best compliments to you.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.19

Pray assure Mr. Courtenay of my most grateful regards.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.20

I ever am, My Dear Sir, your much obliged and affectionate, humble
servant, James Boswell BOSWELL-178X-2,4,281.21

13 Janry. 1786 BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.25

My Dear Sir: I am much obliged to you for the Gentleman's Magazine,
in which the Shuttlecock is excellently kept up.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.26

I do not feel the Attack as severe because the <font> references <$$font>
are never supported when the pages are looked at.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.27

The only thing in it that appears to me worth obviating, is the <font>
misunderstanding <$$font> of Dr. Johnson's meaning as to the
<font> subject <$$font> of the Journal being <font> fit for publishing.
<$$font> BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.28

It will however be very kind in you to knock this foe and two or three
more against one another.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.29

I have seen the European Magazine which really reviews me very
sensibly, as you have observed; and I think also very favourably.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.30

I am glad to see the Review is to be continued.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.31

I shall meet the continuation and I hope also the Monthly Review in
London on the 2d of february.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.32

I am wonderfully recovered, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.33

and I am agreably {COM:sic} surprised to find the people here by no
means hostile as I apprehended.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.34

Dr. Blair has declared himself to me very well pleased nay
something more, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.35

and he even takes the <font> Cow <$$font> pleasantly.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.36

I had a long walk $t'$other {TEXT:t'other} day with Dr. Robertson
to whom I said I hoped he was not offended at my having honoured my Book
with him.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.37

He said by no means, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,284.38

and we talked a great deal of Dr. Johnson of whom he has a high
opinion, but not to <font> idolatry <$$font> as some of us are thought
to <P_4,285> have.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.39

He said the Dr. wrote letters admirably and that those to Lord
Elibank and the Duke of Argyle in my Journal are as courtly letters
as he ever read; that Johnson was a man of great wit in conversation,
great taste in his own writings and still more in judging of the writings
of others.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.40

I shall have these two"good and wise Doctors"to dine with me, before I
leave this town.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.41

The weather is so unfavourable that I am not going to Auchinleck.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.42

I met <font> Monbod <$$font> yesterday in the Advocates Library;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.43

but he did not speak to me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.44

This being the case, and as he persists to abuse Dr. Johnson,
he will be fair game in the Life.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.45

Lady Colvill who I thought was offended as a <font> Scotchwoman
<$$font> has no <font> personal <$$font> quarrel with the Journalist,
which I am very glad at as she is one of my most respectable friends.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.46

I am to dine with her today on a boiled Turkey and oyster sauce.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.47

I shall think with social cordiality of worthy hospitable Courtenay,
whom her Ladyship admires exceedingly but has imaged him to be a neat
smart brisk little man.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,285.48

I shall be happy to see his Ode now that it <P_4,286> is completed.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.49

I also long to see his Johnsonian verses in print, not however
without the excuseable {COM:sic} selfishness of hoping that the <font>
Recorder <$$font> of his wonderful conversations will not be forgotten.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.50

You did well to send Davaynes a Book and not ill to give Langton a second.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.51

I hope Mr. Courtenay has had a second.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.52

Did I beg of you to secure me six proofs of my own Mezzotinto by Jones.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.53

Pray do it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.54

I trust I am now <font> resolved <$$font> to make <font> a fair trial
<$$font> in Westr. Hall, without <font> anxiety.  <$$font>
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.55

My Wife thinks it will be better that she and the children come
first to furnished lodgings, that she may take the house herself.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.56

We shall talk of all these things.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.57

My kindest complements to Courtenay.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.58

Ever most affectionately yours, James Boswell BOSWELL-178X-2,4,286.59

14 Janry. 1786 BOSWELL-178X-2,4,289.66

My Dear Sir: By a letter which I received from Dilly today dated 10
Janry. I find that the sale of the Tour"had not been so quick for
ten days and that he should therefore assist the circulation by fresh
advertising near the close of the month. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,289.67

As he does not appear to me to be <font> expert <$$font> in advertising
<paren> as I <P_4,290> perceive the old <font> latin Poems <$$font>
etc. still retained <$$paren> I beg you may be so kind as to take
a little trouble to set him right.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.68

And I really think it would be proper to add {COM:three_asterisks} This
Edition is improved by several corrections, - many additional notes -
a Table of Contents - and Appendix.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.69

You will consider if it should proceed"containing a letter to the Authour
from Dr. <font> Blacklock <$$font>, with the Authours {COM:sic}
remarks - and Verses written and presented to Dr. Johnson in the
Isle of Sky by Sir <font> Alexander <$$font> <paren> now <font> Lord
<$$font> <$$paren> <font> Macdonald <$$font>. " BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.70

<font> This <$$font> or a <font> part <$$font> of it, I imagine may be
of use.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.71

As Mr. James allows me to <font> produce <$$font> his letter to
vindicate me from the <$$font> newspaper reflection <$$font> of having
written the <font> Defence <$$font> myself, might it not be produced in
the <font> same Channel <$$font>?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.72

If Mr. Jones has not yet published my Portrait, I wish to have
of Auchinleck added to my <font> name <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.73

May I also trouble you with this?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.74

My title of <font> Baron d'Auchinleck <$$font> is known on the Continent.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.75

You may smile at my vanity, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.76

but humour it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,290.77

<P_4,291>

If you have not yet looked at <font> Pinkertons's <$$font> two
volumes of Ancient Scottish Poems just published by Dilly, pray do.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.79

His notes rather exceed the Drawcansirship of Robert Herson Esq.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.80

He abuses superlatively not only Johnson, but Swift - Arbuthnot
etc. etc. BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.81

I have not yet read much of Blackstone at this time.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.82

I fear that I shall not be able to study even sufficiently to have a
superficies of english {COM:sic} law.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.83

But you shall command me, as Guide Philosopher and Friend.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.84

The <font> last day <$$font> on which you are to write to me during this
recess is Monday 23 Janry. BOSWELL-178X-2,4,291.85

My Dear Sir: Your kind letter of the 13 current did me much good.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.91

I most sincerely sympathise with you in being out of spirits.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.92

Yet you raised mine.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.93

For, without flattery of any species I tell you, that I am <paren> as our
great Friend wrote to the Chancellor <$$paren> <font> mihi carior <$$font>
when I find myself so much regarded by you.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.94

Courtenay's elogium too elevated me much.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.95

It is beyond my warmest expectation.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.96

How much am I obliged to him.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.97

I wonder why you are"not quite satisfied with the last couplet" With
fond delight we praise his happy vein grac'd with the naivete` of the
sage Montaigne.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.98

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} give it up.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.99

It is perhaps too much in the opinions of many.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.100

But I grasp it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.101

The similarity to Montaigne is quite characteristical.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.102

I long to see the whole Poem.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.103

I have boldly resumed my practice in the Court of Session.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.104

The Court had given judgement unanimously against"my respectable neighbour
Mr. Fairlie".  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.105

I drew a Petition which fortunately had such an effect as to turn
the tide.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,292.106

The Lord President said <P_4,293> from the chair:"My Lords, I must say
to my friend Mr. Boswell <paren> whom I am happy to see here
<$$paren> that this paper is very well drawn, both as to matter and
manner. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.107

- This publick praise made a good deal of noise, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.108

and it is now said that whenever I chuse {COM:sic} it, I may return to
the bar here with a good prospect of success.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.109

This is well.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.110

His Lordship had me to dine with him, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.111

and we took our wine jovially.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.112

Excellent all this after my Letter on the Judges Bill.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.113

You speak philosophically when you say that I consider my movement to
London much too deeply.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.114

It <font> must <$$font> be now, after going so far.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.115

Enclosed is a letter about securing a House in Great Queen Street which
I beg you may read, seal and send; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.116

and if you could look at it and give your opinion it would be very kind.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,293.117

My Dear Sir: The weather has proved much milder, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.124

and the roads are excellent.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.125

I shall write to Mr. Warton from York.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.126

I envy you the reading of the Letters with his Notes.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.127

I am very desireous {COM:sic} that the second edition affair should be
well settled: BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.128

And to the World who know me not as you do, I should think that in
case the <font> fact <$$font> as to a Letter being actually written to
me should be mentioned in the Papers it would be of great consequence
that you and Mr. Courtenay as my friends while I am absent on the
Circuit should state the matter in my letter to the Paper to consist with
your knowledge, that a letter from the noble Lord was <font> afterwards
<$$font> received - BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.129

and it also consists with your knowledge that an explanation honourable
<paren> or proper, or some such expression <$$paren> to both parties
took place.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.130

This would knock it on the head.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,295.131

<P_4,296>

Enclosed are six of my Ballad {COM:sic} which I neglected to give you.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.133

- After Courtenay's verse I would insert the following
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.134

Nor can we to Sheridan's fame be unjust Who cleared the whole question
from sophistry's dust Nor to Dempster's who ill even at peril of
death Risk'd that night in the Senate to yield his last breath.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.135

The last evening we were at Courtenay's I imagine I perceived some
alteration in the verses on me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.136

I hope <font> the keen research <$$font> is not omitted.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.137

I think"By him was taught the sacred love of truth"etc. etc.
were well.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.138

This Letter for Mr. Courtenay as well as yourself.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,296.139

<P_4,297>

I hope to hear Barrister at law York.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.141

Grantham at night BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.143

I am now quietly passing my evening at the house of the Rev.
Dr. Palmer an old Clergyman a very reading man, who knew Warburton
at an early period.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.144

I <font> intreat <$$font> that <font> Neck or nothing <$$font> as
Mr. Courtenay worded that <font> tendresse <$$font> of mine,
may be <font> entre nous <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.145

There is no harm in talking of it with levity as I do at large.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.146

But no <font> particulars <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.147

I tax your friendship exorbitantly.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.148

But believe me I am very sensible of your kindness.

{ED:Tadcaster}

Sunday Morning BOSWELL-178X-2,4,297.152

Upon better consideration it appears to me that Mr. Courtenay and
you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attest that the <font> Letter <$$font> from
a noble Lord to me was <P_4,298> settled on <font> honourable <$$font>
terms for <font> both <$$font> parties.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.153

I still have <font> some <$$font> uneasy doubt that I was wrong in
not firing at once at the unsigned absurd abuse, and calling on him to
<font> name <$$font> the <font> atonement <$$font> or to ask pardon for
the letter.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.154

But I had the friendly counsel of you both to act as I did,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.155

and you may recollect the sad depression of spirits in which that letter
found me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.156

And after all as Courtenay said to me $t $other {TEXT:tother} day I
was <font> right <$$font> as a man of <font> good principles <$$font>
, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.157

for as I was to a certain degree the Agressor {COM:sic}, had I acted
with hasty violence and the consequence been fatal I should have been
reckoned a <font> Ruffian.  <$$font> BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.158

The truth is that a man who fears fear is anxiously jealous of himself.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.159

But on the other hand I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} think it <font> quite
<$$font> honourable to annihilate what a man has written to another,
<font> after <$$font> a very <font> intelligible <$$font> message has
been received.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.160

Mr. Courtenay and you may concert how to express that by the
interposition of friends the affair was settled.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.161

I own I should wish exceedingly that an attestation by such men as you and
him should be brought out, so that the Matter might be forever quashed
, without all the circumstances being disclosed, as to which there
might be room enough for $ill-disposed {TEXT:ill_disposed} cavilling.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.162

I am so exceedingly well at present, that nothing whatever appears too
difficult for me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.163

I am going to church here and then to proceed to York, to take my place
at the <font> counsel <$$font> Board as Junior.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.164

If I do succeed as an english {COM:sic} Barrister, and add something to
my Family, I shall owe it to you; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.165

for, you <font> held <$$font> me to it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.166

If I do not succeed I shall owe to you the tranquillity produced by
having made the trial, and the better existence in a better country.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.167

I have written the additions to my Ballad on a separate leaf, to save
you trouble in transcribing; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.168

for, after settling how it should be, you may send the leaf to
Marshall's in Aldermary Churchyard with J. B.'s compliments.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,298.169

I think in <font> equity <$$font> they have a right to the <P_4,299>
best edition.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.170

If you have the curiosity to call yourself, and view the great
<font> Officina Cantilenarum <$$font>, you may deliver the leaf.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.171

And as they may have thrown off a number of the <font> first <$$font>,
you will please <font> to <$$font> send or give them a crown to reprint
it, if you think it worth while.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.172

But let a parcel of them be sent to you, of which send me half a dozen.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.173

I really wish the People to be warm and vigilant upon this <font>
antinaval <$$font> business.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.174

Dr. Palmer asked me -"When are we to have your friend Mr.
$Malone $'s {TEXT:Malone's} Shakespeare? "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.175

My answer was"I am affraid {COM:sic_here_and_passim} not till next
winter. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.176

Pray what answer am I to give when that question is put to me at any time?
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.177

He shewed me the translation of Coursaz which has been
ascribed to Dr. Johnson; But which is certainly not his.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.178

I agree with you that the translation itself is not a test.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.179

But the Preface is.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.180

Be so good as <font> to <$$font> tell Mr. Courtenay that
I am now for <font> fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloanthum <$$font>.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.181

I enclose a leaf of Knox's Essays wrapped round my shoe-buckles
at Dilly's, in which are paragraphs wonderfully Johnsonian.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.182

I think perfectly so, except the first three lines of the second as to
which I doubt.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,299.183

<P_4,300>

I would have Croft Knox and Nares to this great school belong And many
more than can be nam'd in song.  Croft - because his Young <paren>
notwithstanding Burke <$$paren> is for the most part undistinguishable
{COM:sic} - Knox because he is very like, and is a Writer of
prodigious popularity - Nares because he is also very like and has I
think uncommon merit which deserves to be pointed out to the World.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,300.185

After that Couplet will come the <font> Names <$$font> amidst whom He
who now sits over Coffee and toast and Muffin $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be forgot.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,300.186

My most cordial compliments to Courtenay.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,300.187

I intend to return from <font> Lichfield <$$font> by <font> Oxford
<$$font> to forage at Pembroke and University Colleges for my Great Work.

My Dear Sir: The additional lines you have been so good as to send me
are exquisitely fine, particularly those upon our Great Friend's latin
poetry, in which I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} perceive one fault or one
line or word that should be altered, unless <font> soothing <$$font>
Lyre be too <font> gentle <$$font> for a giant.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.193

Those too on Jones and the additional couplet to the <font> School
<$$font> are admirable.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.194

The <font> Conclusion <$$font> is also a valuable improvement.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.195

But I have some difficulty as to the first line of the couplet
as to which I observe Mr. Courtenay and you are undecided.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.196

"Whose mind <font> discursive <$$font>"is very well suited to" every
Science <font> traced <$$font>", but not so well to <font> embraced
<$$font>, as"Whose <font> ample <$$font> mind"; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.197

But then an <font> ample <$$font> mind is not so well suited to"each
path of science traced".  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.198

I prefer the first reading; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.199

and upon better consideration a <font> discursive <$$font> mind may be
<font> enlarged <$$font> enough to embrace morals arts and languages.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.200

We shall have a most respectable Poem of it at last.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.201

I certainly agree with you that I may be well satisfied with the honour
done me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.202

It was not"<font> deep <$$font> research", but"<font> keen <$$font>
research", which I missed.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.203

<font> Deep <$$font> I should have objected to as not just.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.204

I am quite pleased with my share of praise, as the lines now stand.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.205

I have read my Letter in the Morning Chronicle and St. James's
Evening.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.206

I am much obliged to their Editors and to that of the P. A.
for their genteel behaviour.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.207

It was however worth a guinea to have it in the Herald.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,303.208

<P_4,304>

Courtenay once proposed that an Action should be brought against
the Publisher of Peter Pindar's Attack which we have now repelled.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.210

But what would you think of prosecuting him for the $Postscript in which
he <font> falsely <$$font> asserts that a conversation passed between
<font> him <$$font> and Dr. Johnson in which the Doctor spoke of me
in the most contemptuous manner, and <font> particularly <$$font> enlarged
on my being incapable to write his Life.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.211

Absurdly malignant as this really is, it <font> may <$$font> be believed
by many people, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.212

and therefore <font> may <$$font> injure the success of my Great Work.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.213

I own I am not much affraid of this.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.214

But if I thought that a verdict would be obtained merely to proclaim
the falsehood of the fellow and punish him in the most <font> tender
<$$font> part his <font> purse, <$$font>, I certainly should prosecute.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.215

And you will consider if this would not give an opportunity to announce
the Work in the most splendid manner.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.216

Erskine would expatiate upon it as not only to be the Life and
Conversation of the first Genius etc. etc. etc. but
the History of Literature and Literary Men during a considerable period.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.217

A letter or two of Dr. Johnson's to me might be <font>
proved <$$font> and read; as might Dr. Blair's to me,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,304.218

and if necessary a good deal of parole evidence might be <P_4,305>
produced to shew how gross the calumny is.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.219

Perhaps even Lord Carmarthen's letter containing the polite approbation
of a Great Personage might be introduced.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.220

Do consult with Mr. Courtenay as to this; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.221

for, it appears to me a very good use might be made of such an Action.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.222

I am <font> learning <$$font> wonderfully as I shall prove to you by
my Note-Book.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.223

I am assured that my assiduous attention will procure me Brieffs {COM:sic}
against the Summer Assizes.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.224

But I do not expect one here at this time.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.225

There is a number of provincial Counsel who previously secure the small
business, and a great many Yorkshire Counsel come from London, so that
a new man must have some <font> particular <$$font> recommendation to
get himself fairly introduced: BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.226

I have not the least doubt but that when I am once started, I shall be
in request.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.227

You see I am just in the patient and hopeful frame that I should be.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.228

It is amazing how I do my duty as <font> Junior <$$font> of our law
society; how I regulate our Mess, and how I dance with the Ladies.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.229

I at first lived too hard, which is very wrong in every view.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.230

But I have taken up, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.231

and am shewing that I can be an <font> Aristippus <$$font>.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.232

Do let me hear from you as often as you can.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.233

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} express what good you do me.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.234

You make me live <font> mihi carior <$$font> as poor Sam wrote to Lord
Thurlow.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.235

After <font> friday {COM:sic} <$$font> direct <font> Lancaster <$$font>
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,305.236

I <font> felt <$$font> it to be well done, though conscious of its

Pray send her to me in franks <font> on the Northern Circuit <$$font>.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.255

The Appeal in the House of Lords in which I am Counsel is to come on
the 12 April.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.256

I must therefore be with you on the 10, unless I can get it put off till
after Easter, which I doubt will not be, as one delay has already been
granted on my Account.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.257

Yet I am to make our Solicitors try, as the Assizes at Lancaster
will not be over by the 10, and I wish to attend all through.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.258

We have this morning lost Sir Thomas Davenport who has languished in a
fever for ten days.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.259

I have had the happiness to prevent a duel between two of my bretheren

BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.260

When you pass through Great Queen Street will you be kind enough to

I intend to take possession of it in a few days after my return and to

which I have the pleasure to find grows more familiar to me every day.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,307.262

My Dear Friend: I feel with all possible warmth of gratitude your kindness
to me, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,312.273

and I am determined more and more to <P_4,313> deserve it.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.274

I found here both your letters of the 25 and 27.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.275

By my last you would see that my illness was by no means such as I had
just reason to apprehend, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.276

and <font> now <$$font> it is very gentle.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.277

I therefore do not take your advice borrowed from King Duncan"Go get
him Surgeons. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.278

The truth is I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} lie; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.279

and I fear that one on whom it is not proper perfectly to rely might order
me some <font> course <$$font> which I should not like to venture upon,
and should not know how to evade.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.280

I thank you for not sending what killed Canning though I $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} conceive why what has been so beneficial to thousands
should be so fatal to <font> him <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.281

I am to take slight mercurial pills which I have directed a Chemist to
make up.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.282

It is much better that I attend the Assizes here.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.283

I am gaining practical knowledge, habituating myself to english modes,
and making myself observed for assiduity.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.284

My <font> misfortune <$$font> I have with my <font> facility of manners
<$$font> <paren> which Dr. Adam Smith early allowed me <$$paren>
rendered scarcely the subject even of raillery.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.285

So all is wonderfully well in this <font> last <$$font> $excursion into
the <font> wilds <$$font> of Venus.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.286

I rejoice to hear that Courtenay's admirable Verses are to appear so soon.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.287

I suppose they <font> have <$$font> appeared by this time.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.288

It is too late now for the first edition of them to mention, that
in the passage on Dr. Johnson's latin verses, I am not
sure if <font> soothing <$$font> be a good epithet for his Lyre.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.289

Yet I know not what other to suggest.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.290

I wish for one more {COM:sic} <font> sounding <$$font> more <font>

Also I doubt if his <font> classick <$$font> strains be right, -
after shewing that they are <font> not <$$font> taken from $classicks.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.292

Yet as they are shewn to be the true $Horatian fruit raised in British
soil, I may be wrong.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,313.293

which I allude, I am sure he will.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.297

As Voltaire's old grayheaded domestick Jesuit <font> Pe`re Adam <$$font>

And now for La Signora Piozzi.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.300

I received her by the coach only last night <font> Thursday <$$font>
, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.301

and her journey down cost me within 6 d. of her original price.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.302

I however did not grudge the cost, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.303

and <font> devoured <$$font> her as you say.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.304

I had before the Book arrived, two <font> whets <$$font> in the <font>
Herald <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.305

She is a little artful impudent malignant Devil.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.306

She relates that Johnson in reference to her <font> littleness <$$font>
said Insects have gay colours.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.307

I will add Insects are often <font> Venomous <$$font> have often <font>
stings <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.308

It is <font> clear <$$font> that she <font> means <$$font> to bite me
as much as she can, that she may curry favour with Mrs. Montague.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.309

P. 44 is <font> undoubtedly <$$font> levelled at me;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.310

for, it <font> describes <$$font> what the Jade has often seen me
do - but with Dr. Johnson's <font> approbation <$$font>;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.311

for he at all times was flattered by my preserving what fell from his
mind when shaken by conversation, so there was nothing <font> like
<$$font> treachery.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.312

I must have the patience of <font> Job <$$font> to bear the Book of <font>
Esther <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.313

But I shall trim her <font> recitativo <$$font> and all her <font> airs.
<$$font> BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.314

The <font> retort <$$font> upon <font> in vino veritas <$$font> which
she affects to <font> remember <$$font> as if she had been <font>
present <$$font> was told to her by myself, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.315

and she has either forgotten or misrepresented the true state of it.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,314.316

The argument in favour of drinking was maintained by me one evening at
the Crown and Anchor where Dr. Johnson supt with Lord Binning
<P_4,315> and his tutor, Langton, myself, and $one $or $two more.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.317

But I have it all in writing.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.318

It was I think in $1772 $; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.319

$my Journal will ascertain it all exactly.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.320

I am pretty certain his answer to <font> in vino veritas <$$font> was
"Sir a fellow is not much to be regarded who $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
speak truth till you fill him drunk. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.321

I am <font> sure <$$font> he did not <font> point <$$font> his fire
personally to <font> me <$$font>, till after I had teased him long,
to bring out all I could.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.322

When I at last said,"But Sir would not you drink to forget care, to
forget every thing disagreable? "Johns."Yes, - if I sat next <font>
you <$$font>. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.323

<font> Madam <$$font> as <font> Sam <$$font> said"has no care about
truth. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.324

We shall concert a genteel Reply to her, to this effect.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.325

She should have stated <font> fairly <$$font> - not said by <font>
me <$$font> as might be supposed from her manner of expressing it, but
<font> reported <$$font> by me to have been said by Dr. Johnson.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.326

Two particulars are to be considered.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.327

1st.  If Dr. Johnson said it his sacred love of truth as
acknowledged by herself and his remarkable accuracy, must counterballance
{COM:sic} what she is <font> now <$$font> pleased to set forth.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.328

I should rather suppose <font> her <$$font> forgetful, than <font>
him <$$font> mistaken.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.329

- Then 2d.  Whether my <font> Report <$$font> is to be credited?
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.330

It is in my Journal written at the time, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.331

and that Journal was revised by Dr. Johnson.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.332

I had no motive whatever to <font> invent <$$font> it.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.333

Nay so far was I from wishing it should appear that upon correcting the
proof sheet in which it occurs, I said <paren> As Mr. Malone and
Mr. Courtenay will remember <$$paren>"Why should I set two women
to pull one anothers {COM:sic} caps?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.334

Besides had Mrs. Thrale been still in the state she formerly was,
I might have been less scrupulous; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,315.335

but now that she is under a cloud, and may probably desire to have the
protection of Mrs. <P_4,316> Montagu should she venture to return
to England, it might hurt her; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.336

and I dare say she would deny it. "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.337

Upon these considerations I struck it out, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.338

and some hundreds of the first edition were actually thrown off without
it; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.339

Sir Joshua Reynolds's copy has it not.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.340

Mr. Courtenay however insisted that as Dr. Johnson had
done Mrs. Thrale the honour to quote her as an authority on taste
and to class her with himself and Beauclerk, I had no right to deprive
her of such a distinction to which she had an authentick title under my
own hand.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.341

I was convinced, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.342

and ordered her name to be reinstated.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.343

Thus it is - between my unbiassed record, and Mrs. Thrale's
accuracy of remembrance as to which I must be forgiven for entertaining
some doubt, especially where she will not deny that she has a little
interest to forget.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.344

It is strange that she has heard <font> every one <$$font> commend
Mrs. Montagus {COM:sic} Book, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.345

for she surely $can $not {TEXT:cannot} reckon Dr. Johnson <font>
nobody <$$font> BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.346

and it is very well known how <font> He <$$font> talked of it.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.347

I shall then tell his criticism on it at length to Sir Joshua's face when
they were dining at my lodgings, as also what he said at Sir Joshua's
table in the hearing of Sir Joshua and his nephew the Rev.
Mr. Jo. Palmer that"When Shakespeare has - for a rival
and Mrs M. for a defender he is in a pitiful state indeed.
"BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.348

We shall have all this <paren> on which I have dwelt too long;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.349

but I wish to speak a little to the <font> Blue <$$font> World <$$paren>
well drest.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.350

<font> Eaton <$$font> Graham is I fancy only an errour of the press;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.351

for, he was an under Master or Usher at Eton School.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.352

She seems to have had no <font> affection <$$font> for our great friend,
but merely the attachment of vanity.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.353

She describes him as barbarous and dirty.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.354

The story of spitting her relations is I suppose exagerated {COM:sic}
; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.355

or she must have provoked him confoundedly by <font> affectation <$$font>
of grief.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,316.356

The book however has a <P_4,317> great deal of valuable Memorabilia,
which prove themselves genuine.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.357

But there is seldom the true <font> zest <$$font>.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.358

She puts cherries in the brandy.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.359

I am glad that a third edition of my Tour is thought not unadviseable
{COM:sic}.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.360

But let it not be begun till I return, that I may make it quite correct.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.361

I <font> positively <$$font> will give you your note on Burke,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.362

it has been so much admired.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.363

I hope to be with you on the 10 or 11.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,317.364

I am now completely armed against <P_4,318> Signora Piozzi -
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.373

She read the three volumes of my original Journal,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.374

and did not deny as to Mrs. Montagu.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.375

Only think of my not recollecting this, when I last wrote to you.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.376

As you are upon the spot and can better judge than I can of the <font>
effect <$$font> of her <font> denial <$$font> which from <font> le
bon Dillys <$$font> account is <font> strong <$$font>, you will please
to decide whether the enclosed should not be immediately put into the
newspapers.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.377

Consult with Courtenay.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.378

I will not send it to the venal <font> Chanticleer <$$font>.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.379

But I am sure the <font> Publick <$$font> - the <font> St. James s
{COM:sic} <$$font> and probably the Morning Post will insert it liberally.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.380

I should think too the Gentlemans {COM:sic} Magazine would give it
a place.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.381

I myself think it ought to appear, and that I should pay for it rather
than that it should not.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.382

Its appearing speedily too I think of some consequence;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.383

otherwise it might do in my"Third Edition - With a Postscript concerning
Signora Piozzi".  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.384

I shall at any rate have such a Postscript.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.385

But it appears to me that an <font> immediate <$$font> trimming may be
of service.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.386

I leave it to you entirely to correct vary abridge enlarge my Reply,
as you think best.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.387

May I not appeal to Sir Joshua who often heard our friend upon Mrs.
Montagu's Essay - particularly when Shakespeare has - for a rival and
Mrs. M. for a Defender, he is in a pitiful state indeed.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.388

Might not we add Mr. Langton and others.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.389

Pray see as to this.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.390

I have put the passage as to the great Brewer's Wife within hooks,
for considerations.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.391

It would I dare say vex her; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.392

but is it not too coarse?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.393

Yet it shews <font> how <$$font> she might talk <font> differently
<$$font> then from what she now does of Mrs. M.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.394

Shall the addition with {COM:three_asterisks} appear at all?
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.395

and if it does would it be better to be inserted <font> before <$$font>
my subscription?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,318.396

Would it be proper to introduce into this Reply the Account of <P_4,319>
the passage being first left out etc. - and the pulling of caps,
and the <font> prophesy <$$font> that she would <font> deny <$$font>?
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.397

You can indent it charmingly if you think fit.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.398

I am quite ashamed, or rather am sensible I <font> ought <$$font> to be
ashamed of giving you so much trouble.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.399

But I am conscious I would do as much for you, if I could have an
opportunity.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.400

I long much to see Courtenay's Poem in print, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.401

and I hope it will come to me here in franks.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.402

After this you will direct to me no more at Lancaster;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.403

for we leave it, I beleive {COM:sic} on thursday or friday.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.404

If my Cause in the House of Lords is to come on the 12, I shall proceed
directly to London.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.405

If it is put off, I shall go round by Lichfield and Oxford.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.406

I have not yet written to Mr. Thomas Warton, which is wrong.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.407

I may delay it now, till I have read his communications, in case I do
not pay him a visit.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.408

I expect every day a letter from the Solicitor in the appeal to inform
me as to the time fixed.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.409

I long much to be with you again.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.410

Yet I am vastly well upon the Circuit.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.411

My accessions of knowledge please me much, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.412

and I value myself on my assiduity.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.413

I was Counsel for a prisoner on Saturday BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.414

and $cross-examined {TEXT:cross_examined} boldly.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.415

Yours with great regard, J. B. BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.416

I have had a charming letter from Downpatrick.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.417

I believe I shall be quite comme il faut very soon.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,319.418

{ED:enclosure}

Having read a Postscript <paren> dated <font> Naples <$$font> <$$paren>
to <font> Signora Piozzi's <$$font> Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson in
which after mentioning that"it is <font> said <$$font> <P_4,320> in my
Tour to the Hebrides that <font> She could not get through Mrs.
Montagu's Essay on Shakespeare <$$font>", she declares as follows"
<font> On the contrary <$$font> I have <font> always <$$font> commended
it myself, and heard it commended by <font> every one <$$font> else.  "-
I beg leave to observe that it would have been fairer to have mentioned
<font> who <$$font> said it, which was not <font> I <$$font> but <font>
Dr. Johnson <$$font> for whom she once professed both respect
and affection whatever she at last felt from his frowns, and however
she may venture to treat his character.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.420

And as there seems to be an oblique <font> stiletto <$$font> in the
paragraph, the <font> Signora <$$font> will pardon <font> me <$$font>
for <font> now <$$font> saying that I trust more to the accuracy of the
<font> Report <$$font> in my Journal, than to her memory at this distance
of time, especially when it is a little biased.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.421

My reasons for this confidence are, <font> first <$$font> that the
Report so far as Dr. Johnson himself is concerned is perfectly
agreable to the opinion which he at all times expressed of Mrs.
Montagu's Essay, for which I shall appeal to Sir Joshua Reynolds;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.422

and I <font> wonder <$$font> that he <font> never <$$font> expressed it
to <font> Mrs. Thrale.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.423

Second <$$font> He would not have told the circumstance of Mrs.
Thrale's not relishing the Book had he not been <font> sure <$$font>
of the fact BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.424

and as he read over my Journal he would have corrected the passage had
I mistaken him.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.425

But <font> Third Mrs. Thrale herself <$$font> many years ago
perused my Journal in the original Manuscript as far as to the Isle
of Col; as to which I <font> have a letter under her own hand <$$font>
in very flattering terms; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.426

and therefore as the passage in question was read by her, she certainly
would have objected to it, had she <font> then <$$font> thought it
erroneous.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.427

<paren> But she was <font> then <$$font> the great Brewer's Wife in all
the pomp of wealth.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-178X-2,4,320.428

<P_4,321>

If <font> Signora Piozzi <$$font> wishes to make the experiment of
returning to England, and taking a place in the <font> Bluestocking
<$$font> Circles, it is very proper that she should pay her court to
Mrs. Montagu.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,321.430

But I do not chuse that she should do it <font> in this way.  <$$font>
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,321.431

James Boswell BOSWELL-178X-2,4,321.432

{COM:three_asterisks} I shall by and by have occasion to speak more fully
concerning the above, and several other passages of Signora Piozzi's Book.

Safely arrived here My dear Friend, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.438

I write, to mention a few things - BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.439

My address is Auchinleck Cumnock Dumfries, the postdays from London,
Monday Wednesday friday {COM:sic}.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.440

I get the Publick Advertiser.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.441

So you have only to mention any squibs in the Herald.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.442

Be so good as to get my crest engraved again from the title page of the
second edition.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.443

I would have little advertising till winter - BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.444

I would say"This day is published carefully corrected and enlarged
with additional notes particularly suitable animadversions on
Hester Lynch Piozzi etc. The Third Edition of etc."
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.445

Do as you will.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.446

I think <font> She <$$font> should be mentioned.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.447

If the Advertisement be not thrown off - instead of wit etc. <font>
Exhibited <$$font> I would say <font> recorded <$$font> because it is the
word of most <font> import <$$font> and has been <font> laughed <$$font>
at by the Buffoons; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.448

so I would <font> brave <$$font> them.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.449

Let the Advertisement be dated London 15 August 1786.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,324.450

I do not mean <P_4,325> to make <font> presents <$$font> of the third

It shall have a fair chance.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,325.452

The Dedication copy must be elegantly bound by Searle Mr. Kirkley's
son in law, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,325.453

and Dr. Barnard Bishop of Kilaloe must have one for St.
Woolstans.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,325.454

Adieu.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,325.455

I am quite comfortable, and very happy in the prospect of being so soon
with my true Montgomerie and our children, and not being long from you
and my other London friends.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,325.456

I am ever most warmly yours, J. B. BOSWELL-178X-2,4,325.457

2 June 1788 BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.478

My Dear Sir: This morning <paren> being the first weekday of the month
<$$paren> I thought with pleasure on our <font> mensiversary <$$font>
meeting at breakfast to read the Johnsoniana of the preceeding {COM:sic}
month in the E. M. G. M. etc.
etc. etc. BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.479

and Monboddo's whim as to the soul being present in the place
on which thought is fixed for the moment, was almost realised.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.480

My Wife though she made out the journey in six days and a half, being
impatient to get home to her own appartment {COM:sic}, has I think been
rather worse since she came here.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.481

Perhaps the agitation of travelling may have increased the fever;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.482

for her pulse is a good deal quicker than it was in London.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.483

The Physician whom I called to her from our County town, a sensible
honest man, fairly told me that he knew no medecine {COM:sic} that could
be of any service to her; that her constitutional disorder had been
growing worse from year to year, that she could not entirely recover,
and that she must depend on light diet, good air, quiet, and moderate
exercise for alleviating her complaints and prolonging her life.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.484

She is in the mean time sadly distressed and dismally apprehensive.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,334.485

<P_4,335>

God may be pleased to recover her as upon former occasions.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.487

But I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help being much affraid.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.488

As for myself, I have since I left you been blest with health and sound
spirits, so that I have been enabled to enjoy and to bear, the good and
evil of my existence, wonderfully well.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.489

Could such a state but last, I should be apt to contravert Johnson's
gloomy notions of Life.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.490

But alas!  I have had too much experience of a different state;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.491

and I may be persuaded that I shall have more.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.492

Much comfort and felicity have I had in your society,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.493

and much I still hope I shall have.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.494

I have now been here a forthnight BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.495

and must acknowledge that I have done very little to advance the Life.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.496

A few visits from intimate neighbours who notwithstanding my Wife's
situation have been with me, and a great variety of business upon my
Estate have occupied me, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.497

and supplied an excuse for indolence.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.498

I shall however task myself as in London, and get on.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.499

I see no paper but The P. A. in which there has been no
mention $whatever of <font> The Ode <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.500

Pray what $became of it?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.501

Did it run at all BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.502

$or $was it crushed in the bud?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,335.503

Have your foreigners as we may now call them returned yet?

York, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.513

12 July 1788 BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.514

My Dear Malone: Your long letter came safely to me before I left
Auchinleck on the 1st of this month, upon my own horse, to join the
Northern Circuit here, which I have done.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.515

I was not careless as to giving you my address.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.516

It was formerly by Cumnock and Dumfries.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.517

But a post being now established at Machline the next village to me,
I left a note of direction for you, <font> Auchinleck Machline by
Edinburgh <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.518

However my daughter's direction by <font> Kilmarnock <$$font> which is
eight miles farther off, did very well.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.519

It was very obliging in you to give me so full an account of Sheridan's
celebrated summing up, which has undoubtedly been a very brilliant
exhibition of talents; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.520

and I see the strong impression which it made upon you from the way in
which you express yourself.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.521

But now that the fervour is somewhat abated, I hope you can bear to be
told that I am still hopeful that for the honour of Britain and that
of undoubtedly a great and meritorious Conductor of affairs which,
however I may as a humane moralist disapprove, are sanctioned by this
country, Warren Hastings shall upon the whole be found not guilty.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,341.522

It is fair to tell you that I dined yesterday with the ArchBishop
{COM:sic} of York, and that the Wines <P_4,342> <paren> in particular
the Burgundy <$$paren> were excellent, and given with Archiepiscopal
hospitality.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.523

You fully excused yourself for your long silence in the"vacancy"of
which my"keen eye"was beginning to see unpleasing possibilities.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.524

You must have indeed been a very busy man, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.525

and I rejoice that you was {COM:sic} so successful, and that our estimable
young friend Jephson enjoyed what he deserved.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.526

Miss Catharine Malone shewed a spirit truly milesian in repeatedly
encountering the perilous struggles at the door of the Hall.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.527

As nobody could be admitted without tickets it was surely very
illjudged {COM:sic} in those who had them to assemble so early.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.528

But a good place upon such an occasion is something though I think it
was bought too dear.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.529

I am glad that you have had, and are to have so much agreable time with
your Ladies.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.530

You know what a Circuit is, by supposing something rather better than
what you have seen; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.531

and you may guess how I contrast my situation with yours.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.532

I am however animated with the consciousness of acting with a very manly
spirit, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.533

and though a dreary remonstrance from my spanish brother, that I am
lessening myself when there is not the least probability of my getting
business, be seconded by my having no brief here, I am not cast down.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.534

I attend diligently, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.535

I take good notes, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.536

I feel a gradual accession of knowledge, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.537

and I look forward with hope.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,342.538

Indeed I was assured of three briefs at Newcastle <P_4,343> before I
left London.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.539

This is all <font> biographical <$$font> as we have pleasantly talked.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.540

Before I set out from Auchinleck, my Wife had a very favourable remission
of her severe and alarming complaints.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.541

The country air, Asses milk, the little amusements of ordering about
her family, gentle exercise, and the comfort of being at home and
amongst old and valuable friends had a very benignant effect upon her;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.542

and I would fain flatter myself that she may recover though not full
health, yet such a degree of it as that she may enjoy life moderately
well.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.543

Her preservation is of great importance to me and my children, so that
there is no wonder that I suffer frequently from anxious apprehensions,
which make me shrink.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.544

I sometimes upbraid myself for leaving her; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.545

but tenderness should yield to the active engagement of ambitious
enterprise.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.546

I am not sure whether I shall go all round this Circuit, though I rather
think I shall, unless I hear that she is worse.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.547

But you will be very angry when I confess to you, that I have not
yet advanced a single page in Johnson's Life, since I left London.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.548

The truth is that during the six weeks that I was at Auchinleck I
was in some degree indolent or rather averse to sedentary exertion;
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.549

I had a great deal of business to settle in the management of my estate
, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.550

and having been a declared candidate for the County ever since the last
election I found such an appearance of stirring, that it was proper for
me to begin my canvas directly, in which I tell <font> you <$$font>,
not ostentatiously, that I have met with more success than I expected.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.551

You know that in the scotch counties there are comparatively speaking
few freeholders, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.552

I suppose not above 300 in any County; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.553

and if the votes which I and many others call <font> nominal and
fictitious votes <$$font> be struck off according to the Lord Chancellor's
opinion, I suppose there will not be above fourscore in Ayrshire.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,343.554

But the uncertainty as to the <font> sincerity <$$font> of each of those
votes <paren> as Lord Thurlow well expressed himself <$$paren> that
is to say <P_4,344> being really and true the freehold of the voter,
and not a vote <font> by <$$font> the <font> Grantor through <$$font>
the voter, will make our county elections curiously dubious if no law
be made to ascertain with more precision the legality of our votes.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.555

I stand between two parties - the State Coalition interest which is to
support one candidate, and a strange coalition between Lord Eglintoune
and Sir Adam Fergusson who are both with the present administration,
but which has given great offence to many of their friends, who will
therefore prefer me who am of the same political way of thinking,
without having the exceptionable circumstance of being in a confederacy
to enthral the country.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.556

Thus I am; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.557

and I assure you the business of what we call <font> riding the County
<$$font>, and being as civil and agreable to every body as possible is
fine training.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.558

I return to Auchinleck from the Circuit, that I may complete my round of
the Freeholders, and arrange a variety of matters concerning my Estate.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.559

Now do not scold me; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.560

for, I promise to set apart so much time for the Life, that the rough
draught shall be all done, and brought with me to town early in October
; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.561

and you know that till the rough draught be finished we $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} proceed in the Metropolis.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.562

I might come a little sooner; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,344.563

but as I must hold the Michaelmas sessions as Recorder of Carlisle,
it would be <P_4,345> travelling 300 miles and back again, for being a
week or two more in London.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.564

Your kind mention of a bed for me in the rural retreat where I suppose
you now are <paren> I hope at dear Dulwich <$$paren> is very flattering.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.565

Pray present my very best compliments to the Ladies, who I hope are to
pass the winter in London.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.566

Much much do I regret the sad reason which will prevent my having a
family to receive them in Great Queen Street, where we have had some
days aye and nights never to be forgotten.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.567

Sir Joshua I doubt not is as well as he can be, in the constant enjoyment
of his art and the best Society.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.568

Do not fail I pray to put him and Courtenay in cordial remembrance of me.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.569

Whom did I meet unexpectedly in my way to York but Batt, on a ride out
from Harrogate, where I agreed to go three miles out of my road to dine
with him at his mess, which I did jovially, in the Reynoldsian style,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.570

and we had an ample conversation concerning the fair Palmeria, which
I reserve till I have the pleasure of <font> joying <$$font> with you
over some old Oporto.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.571

The accounts which you give me through the medium of Devaynes of Veronica
please me much.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.572

To have a daughter in the capital boarding school of Queen Square is an
agreable circumstance.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.573

Had I taken your advice sooner it might have been better.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.574

But pecuniary deficiency is an embarrassing thing.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.575

I trouble you with a letter to my daughter.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.576

I intend to bring my two sons with me, and venture them at
Westminster school, as I can controul them from time to time.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,345.577

A separation however for a long time of <P_4,346> my family is dreary.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.578

You my dear friend can well believe me in this.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.579

I am somewhat alarmed that the <font> Ode <$$font> though so truly good
has not moved.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.580

It is I fear a slight symptom of a cooling as to Johnson.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.581

I have inquired for it at several shops here, in vain though most of
the new publications are to be had.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.582

I have not seen a word about it except in the Monthly Review which
allows it to be <font> witty <$$font>, but thinks the story improbable.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.583

Pray be so good as to inquire for me how many are sold.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.584

When I return to town, I will shew you how I shall <font> puff <$$font>
the embers into a flame.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.585

So let Faulder carefully preserve them.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.586

"Look to't {COM:sic} $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} $do $'t {TEXT:do't}.
"BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.587

And what becomes of Shakespeare amidst all this hurry of harangues,
and parties with Ladies, and rural felicities?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.588

"Pray Sir may I be allowed to ask Are not you the Commentator upon
Shakspeare? "BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.589

I need never be ashamed while you stand between me and publication -
while Mr. Malone's coach stops the way.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.590

I have written you a still longer letter than that with which you
favoured me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.591

Be kind enough to let me hear from you again, if in the course of this
month <font> On the Northern Circuit <$$font> if afterwards <font>
Auchinleck Machline Dumfries <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,346.592

I ever am yours most affectionately and faithfully, James Boswell.

{ED:To_Malone_Thursday_18_September_1788}

Auchinleck, Mauchline BOSWELL-178X-2,4,352.596

N. B. 18 Septr. 1788 BOSWELL-178X-2,4,352.597

My Dear Malone: Your very kind and animated letter"upbraids my too
tedious delay"every time that I look upon it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,352.598

But, if you were busy with the Westminster Election I have been more so
with that of Ayrshire.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,352.599

My chief object is the General Election.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,352.600

But it is believed that we are to have a vacancy declared as soon as
Parliament meets, by our present Member's getting a Place of +L 500
a year.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,352.601

Lord Eglintoune and Sir Adam Fergusson our County Coalition as
heterogeneous as the Great One are <P_4,353> attempting to impose
upon us a gentleman from another county nominated by Dundas.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.602

This a number of us feel as an insult, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.603

and are therefore resisting it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.604

I am as yet the only declared candidate in opposition to it.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.605

I know not what chance I have of success, as a meeting is called to
consider of a proper person; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.606

but my exertion at present will be of service to me against the General
Election.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.607

Pray then accept of this apology for my silence for too long a
time, nay for my having done nothing to Dr. Johnson's Life -
Literally nothing - not a single line of the remaining part of the first
draught which I hoped and trusted should be completely finished here.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.608

It will require an exercise both of your philosophy and indulgent
friendship to make allowance for me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.609

But just consider half my time on the Circuit - half on politicks, county
politicks, and the arrangement of my lands.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.610

I see that <font> the Whole <$$font> will be of London Manufacture.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.611

I am to be at Carlisle to hold the Michaelmas Sessions as Recorder on
the 7th October, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.612

and shall proceed <font> to town <$$font> reckoning to be there about
the 15th.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.613

I shall then set myself <font> doggedly <$$font> to my task, and be <font>
totus in hoc <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.614

I even think of <font> resolving <$$font> not to taste wine till it be
done; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.615

and <font> that <$$font> I think will make me work hard indeed.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.616

I am however seriously uneasy at this delay, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.617

and I beg of you to comfort me, instead of scolding me.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.618

I have always found you a mild Confessor.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.619

You have had I find some excellent days; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.620

that when you drew Burke the 20000 +L prize must have been exquisite.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.621

But how it was not at first told him who the Ladies were, puzzles me.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.622

It was however the occasion of a proud moment to them and to you, with
good reason.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.623

I am much obliged to you and to Miss Catharine for your visit
to <font> Queens Square <$$font>, of which Veronica informed me.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,353.624

I <P_4,354> confess the influence of <font> sounds <$$font>.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.625

The <font> Great Boarding School <$$font> does certainly impress me.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.626

<font> Sound <$$font> also incites me to send my boys to one of the <font>
Great Schools <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.627

But I am distressed what to determine concerning them.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.628

Their mother who though much recovered is still afflicted with her former
complaints in a considerable degree is miserably anxious about them,
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.629

and allows herself to fancy that their health will suffer when
under the care of strangers, and that she will never see them again.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.630

Her tender concern would make me leave them here this winter, if I had
a good english tutor for them.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.631

Yet I consider that her uneasiness will probably abate when they have been
a little while from her, and she has heard that they are well; and that
it will be of essential advantage to them to have an english education.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.632

My present intention is to send them both, but certainly the second to
Westminster; BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.633

so I am to bring them with me.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.634

My fear is that when I have them again in London my irresolution may
again keep them unsettled with only such advantage as Soho Square affords.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.635

I intreat to hear from you by return of post with some <font> mental
bark <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.636

As I imagine Courtenay may be still out of town, I address this directly
to your house.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.637

If you write as late as the 26 or 27 your letter will come to me before
I set out, BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.638

and I do request it.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.639

The taking down your library etc. etc. must appear mighty
operations.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.640

But it will be agreable to see the clean freshness.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.641

You will <font> live pleasanter <$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.642

Your rural retreat has I hope answered your expectations.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.643

Happy shall I be to share it with you, if it does not <$$font>
dissipate <$$font> my <font> Johnsonian <$$font> concentration.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.644

Your account of the charity of your sisters has all the <font> story
<$$font> romance and all the <font> truth <$$font> of Christian
Benevolence.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.645

Pray present my very best compliments to them.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.646

What is Courtenay doing and to do?  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.647

I shall shew you how I can make the Ode fly yet <font> Virum per ora
<$$font>.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,354.648

<P_4,355>

At present I am under one of those clouds with which Johnson was prest,
but which I hope you shall never know.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,355.650

I ever am, My Dear Malone, more and more your affectionate Friend,
James Boswell BOSWELL-178X-2,4,355.651

Be so good as to buy for me the History of the Island of Veritas 2$$6
Sewel and put it up in packets addressed Countess of Craufurd and
these under cover of Hugh Montgomerie Esq. M. P.
Mauchline N. B. and see they are not 2 oz. weight.
BOSWELL-178X-2,4,355.652

Pray remember Mauchline with an H in the middle.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,355.653

My overseer who stands by me says my letter looks like a Dublin Journal,
full all round.  BOSWELL-178X-2,4,355.654
