The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.3

By The Late Henry Fielding, Esq. FIELDING1-1754-2,467.4

<$$heading>

Wednesday, June 26, 1754.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.6

On this day, the most melancholy sun I had ever beheld arose,
FIELDING1-1754-2,467.7

and found me awake at my house at Fordhook.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.8

By the light of this sun, I was, in my own opinion, last to behold and
take leave of some of those creatures on whom I doated with a mother-like
fondness, guided by nature and passion, and uncured and unhardened by
all the doctrine of that philosophical school where I had learnt to bear
pains and to despise death.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.9

In this situation, as I could not conquer nature, I submitted entirely
to her, FIELDING1-1754-2,467.10

and she made as great a fool of me as she had ever done of any woman
whatsoever: FIELDING1-1754-2,467.11

under pretence of giving me leave to enjoy, she drew me in to suffer
the company of my little ones, during eight hours; FIELDING1-1754-2,467.12

and I doubt not whether, in that time, I did not undergo more than in
all my distemper.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.13

At twelve precisely my coach was at the door, which was no sooner told
me than I kissed my children round, and went into it with some little
resolution.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.14

My wife, who behaved more like a heroine and philosopher, though at the
same time the tenderest mother in the world, and my eldest daughter,
followed me, FIELDING1-1754-2,467.15

some friends went with us, FIELDING1-1754-2,467.16

and others here took their leave; FIELDING1-1754-2,467.17

and I heard my behaviour applauded, with many murmurs and praises to which
I well knew I had no title; as all other such philosophers may, if they
have any modesty, confess on the like occasions.  FIELDING1-1754-2,467.18

<P_468>

In two hours we arrived in Redriffe, FIELDING1-1754-2,468.20

and immediately went on board, FIELDING1-1754-2,468.21

and were to have sailed the next morning; FIELDING1-1754-2,468.22

but as this was the king's proclamation-day, and consequently a holiday
at the Custom-house, the captain could not clear his vessel till the
Thursday; FIELDING1-1754-2,468.23

for these holidays are as strictly observed as those in the popish
calendar, FIELDING1-1754-2,468.24

and are almost as numerous.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.25

I might add, that both are opposite to the genius of trade
, and consequently <font> contra bonum publicum.  <$$font>
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.26

To go on board the ship it was necessary first to go into a boat; a matter
of no small difficulty, as I had no use of my limbs, and was to be carried
by men, who, though sufficiently strong for their burden, were, like
Archimedes, puzzled to find a steady footing.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.27

Of this, as few of my readers have not gone into wherries on the
Thames, they will easily be able to form to themselves an idea.
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.28

However, by the assistance of my friend Mr. Welch, whom I never
think or speak of but with love and esteem, I conquered this difficulty,
as I did afterwards that of ascending the ship, into which I was hoisted
with more ease by a chair lifted with pullies.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.29

I was soon seated in a great chair in the cabin, to refresh myself after a
fatigue which had been more intolerable, in a quarter of a mile's passage
from my coach to the ship, than I had before undergone in a land-journey
of twelve miles, which I had travelled with the utmost expedition.
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.30

This latter fatigue was, perhaps, somewhat heightened by an indignation
which I could not prevent arising in my mind.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.31

I think, upon my entrance into the boat, I presented a spectacle of the
highest horror.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.32

The total loss of limbs was apparent to all who saw me,
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.33

and my face contained marks of a most diseased state, if not of death
itself.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.34

Indeed, so ghastly was my countenance, that timorous women with child
had abstained from my house, for fear of the ill consequences of looking
at me.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.35

In this condition, I ran the gauntlope, <paren> so, I think, I may
justly call it <$$paren> through rows of sailors and watermen, few of
whom failed of paying their compliments to me, by all manner of insults
and jests on my misery.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.36

No man who knew me will think I conceived any personal redentment at
this behaviour; FIELDING1-1754-2,468.37

but it was a lively picture of that cruelty and inhumanity in the nature
of men, which I have often contemplated with concern; and which leads
the mind into a train of very uncomfortable and melancholy thoughts.
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.38

It may be said, that this barbarous custom is peculiar to the English,
and of them only to the lowest degree; that it is an excrescence of an
uncontrolled licentiousness mistaken for liberty, and never shews itself
in men who are polished and refined, in such manner as human nature
requires, to produce that perfection of which it is susceptible, and
to purge away that malevolence of disposition, of which, at our birth,
we partake in common with the savage creation.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.39

This may be said, FIELDING1-1754-2,468.40

and this is all that can be said; FIELDING1-1754-2,468.41

and it is, I am afraid, but little satisfactory to account for the
inhumanity of those, who, while they boast of being made after God's own
image, seem to bear in their minds a resemblance of the vilest species; of
brutes; or rather, indeed, of our idea of devils: FIELDING1-1754-2,468.42

for I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know that any brutes can be taxed with
such malevolence.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.43

A surloin of beef was now placed on the table, for which, though little
better than Carrion, as much was charged by the masters of the little
paltry alehouse who dressed it, as would have been demanded for all the
elegance of the King's Arms, or any other polite tavern, or eating-house:
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.44

for, indeed, the difference between the best house and the world is ,
that at the former you pay largely for luxury, at the latter for nothing.
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.45

Thursday, June 27.  FIELDING1-1754-2,468.46

This morning the captain, who lay on shore at his own house, paid us a
visit in the cabin; FIELDING1-1754-2,468.47

and behaved like an angry bashaw, declaring, that had he known we were
not to be pleased, he would not have carried us for five hundred pounds.
FIELDING1-1754-2,468.48

He added many asseverations that he was a gentleman, and despised
money; not forgetting <P_469> several hints of the presents which had
been made him for his cabin, of twenty, thirty, and forty guineas, by
several gentlemen, over and above the sum for which they had contracted.
FIELDING1-1754-2,469.49

This behaviour greatly surprised me, as I knew not how to account for
it, nothing having happened since we parted from the captain the evening
before in perfect good humour; FIELDING1-1754-2,469.50

and all this broke forth on the first moment of his arrival this morning.
FIELDING1-1754-2,469.51

He did not, however, suffer my amazement to have any long continuance,
before he clearly shewed me that all this was meant only as an apology
to introduce another procrastination <paren> being the fifth <$$paren>
of his weighing anchor; which was now postponed till Saturday,
FIELDING1-1754-2,469.52

for such was his will and pleasure.  FIELDING1-1754-2,469.53

Besides the disagreeable situation in which we then lay, in the confines
of Wapping and Redriffe, tasting a delicious mixture of the air of both
these sweet places, and enjoying the concord of sweet sounds of seamen,
watermen, fish-women, oyster-women, and of all the vociferous inhabitants
of both shores, composing altogether a greater variety of harmony than
Hogarth's imagination hath brought together in that print of his, which is
enough to make a man deaf to look at; I had a more urgent cause to press
our departure, which was, that the dropsy, for which I had undergone
three tappings, seemed to threaten me with a fourth discharge, before
I should reach Lisbon, and when I should have no body on board capable
of performing the operation; FIELDING1-1754-2,469.54

but I was obliged to hearken to the voice of reason, if I may
use the captain's own words, and to rest myself contented.
FIELDING1-1754-2,469.55

Indeed, there was no alternative within my reach, but what would have
cost me much too dear.  FIELDING1-1754-2,469.56

There are many evils in society, from which people of the highest
rank are so entirely exempt, that they have not the least knowledge or
idea of them; nor, indeed, of the characters which are formed by them.
FIELDING1-1754-2,469.57

Such, for instance, is the conveyance of goods and passengers from one
place to another.  FIELDING1-1754-2,469.58

Now there is no such thing as any kind of knowledge contemptible in
itself; FIELDING1-1754-2,469.59

and as the particular knowledge I here mean is entirely necessary to the
well understanding and well enjoying this journal, and, lastly, as in
this case the most ignorant will be those very readers whose amusement we
chiefly consult, and to whom we wish to be supposed principally to write,
we will here enter somewhat largely into the discussion of this matter;
the rather, for that no antient or modern author <paren> if we can trust
the catalogue of Doctor Mead's library <$$paren> hath ever undertaken
it; but that it seems <paren> in the style of Don Quixotte <$$paren>
a task reserved for my pen alone.  FIELDING1-1754-2,469.60

When I first conceived this intention, I began to entertain thoughts of
enquiring into the antiquity of travelling; FIELDING1-1754-2,469.61

and, as many persons have performed in this way <paren> I mean have
travelled <$$paren> at the expence of the public, I flattered myself
that the spirit of improving arts and sciences, and of advancing useful
and substantial learning, which so eminently distinguishes this age,
and hath given rise to more speculative societies in Europe than I at
present can recollect the names of; perhaps, indeed, than I or any other
besides their very near neighbours ever heard mentioned, would assist
in promoting so curious a work.  A work!  begun with the same views,
calculated for the same purposes, and fitted for the same uses with
the labours which those right honourable societies have so chearfully
undertaken themselves, and encouraged in others; sometimes with the
highest honours, even with admission into their colleges, and with
inrollment among their members.  FIELDING1-1754-2,469.62

From these societies I promised myself all assistance in their power,
particularly the communication of such valuable manuscripts and records
as they must be supposed to have collected from those obscure ages
of antiquity, when history yields us such imperfect accounts of the
residence, and much more imperfect, of the travels of the human race;
unless, perhaps, as a curious and learned member of the young society
of antiquarians is said to have hinted his conjectures {COM:sic},
that their residence and their travels were <P_470> one and the same;
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.63

and this discovery <paren> for such it seems to be <$$paren> he is said
to have owed the lighting by accident on a book, which we shall have
occasion to mention presently, the contents of which were then little
known to the society.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.64

The King of Prussia, moreover, who from a degree of benevolence and taste,
which in either case is a rare production in so northern a climate ,
is the great encourager of art and science, I was well allured would
promote so useful a design, and order his archives to be searched in
my behalf.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.65

But after well weighing all these advantages, and much meditation on the
order of my work, my whole design was subverted in a moment by hearing of
the discovery just mentioned to have been made by the young antiquarian ,
who, from the most antient record in the world <paren> though I $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} find the society are all agreed in this point <$$paren>
one long preceding the date of the earliest modern collections, either
of books or butterflies, none of which pretend to go beyond the flood ,
shews us, that the first man was a traveller, and that he and his family
were scarce settled in Paradise before they disliked their own home,
and became passengers to another place.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.66

Hence it appears, that the humour of travelling is as old as
the human race, and that it was their curse from the beginning.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.67

By this discovery my plan became much shortened, FIELDING1-1754-2,470.68

and I found it only necessary to treat of the conveyance of goods and
passengers from place to place; which not being universally known,
seemed proper to be explained, before we examined into its original.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.69

There are, indeed, two different ways of tracing all things, used by
the historian and the antiquary FIELDING1-1754-2,470.70

these are upwards and downwards.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.71

The former shews you how things are, FIELDING1-1754-2,470.72

and leaves to others to discover when they began to be so.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.73

The latter shews you how things were, FIELDING1-1754-2,470.74

and leaves their present existence to be examined by others.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.75

Hence the former is more useful; the latter more curious.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.76

The former receives the thanks of mankind; the latter of that valuable
part, the virtuosi.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.77

In explaining, therefore, this mystery of carrying goods and passengers
from one place to another, hitherto so profound a secret to the very best
of our readers, we shall pursue the historical method, and endeavour
to shew by what means it is at present performed, referring the more
curious enquiry either to some other pen, or to some other opportunity.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.78

Now there are two general ways of performing <paren> if God permit
<$$paren> this conveyance; viz. by land and water, both of
which have much variety; that by land being performed in different
vehicles , such as coaches, caravans, waggons, &c. and that by
water in ships, barges, and boats, of various sizes and denominations.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.79

But as all these methods of conveyance are formed on the same
principles, they agree so well together, that it is fully sufficient to
comprehend them all in the general view, without descending to such
minute particulars, as would distinguish one method from another.
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.80

Common to all of these is one general principle, that as the goods to
be conveyed are usually the larger, so they are to be chiefly considered
in the conveyance; FIELDING1-1754-2,470.81

the owner being indeed little more than an appendage to his trunk, or box,
or bale, or at best a small part of his own baggage, very little care is
to be taken in stowing or packing them up with convenience to himself:
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.82

for the conveyance is not of passengers and goods, but of goods and
passengers.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.83

Secondly, From this conveyance arises a new kind of relation, or rather
of subjection in the society; by which the passenger becomes bound in
allegiance to his conveyer.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.84

This allegiance is indeed only temporary and local, but the most
absolute during its continuance, of any known in Great Britain, and,
to say truth, scarce confident with the liberties of a free people,
FIELDING1-1754-2,470.85

nor could it be reconciled with them, did it not move downwards, a
Circumstance universally apprehended to be incompatible to all kinds
of slavery.  FIELDING1-1754-2,470.86

<P_471>

For Aristotle, in his Politicks, hath proved abundantly to my
satisfaction, that no men are born to be slaves, except barbarians
; and there only to such as are not themselves barbarians:
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.88

and indeed Mr. Montesquieu hath carried it very little farther
, in the case of the Africans; the real truth being, that no man
is born to be a slave, unless to him who is able to make him so.
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.89

Thirdly, This subjection is absolute, FIELDING1-1754-2,471.90

and consists of a perfect resignation both of body and soul to the
disposal of another; after which resignation, during a certain time, his
subject retains no more power over his own will, than an Asiatic slave,
or an English wife, by the laws of both countries, and by the customs
of one of them.  FIELDING1-1754-2,471.91

If I should mention the instance of a stage-coachman, many of my readers
would recognize the truth of what I have here observed; all indeed,
that ever have been under the dominion of that tyrant, who, in this free
country, is as absolute as a Turkish Bashaw.  FIELDING1-1754-2,471.92

In two particulars only his power is defective; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.93

he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} press you into his service,
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.94

and if you enter yourself at one place, on condition of being discharged
at a certain time at another, he is obliged to perform his agreement,
if God permit: FIELDING1-1754-2,471.95

but all the intermediate time you are absolutely under his government;
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.96

he carries you how he will, when he will, and whither he will, provided
it be not much out of the road; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.97

you have nothing to eat, or to drink, but what, and when, and where
he pleases.  FIELDING1-1754-2,471.98

Nay, you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} sleep, unless he pleases you should;
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.99

for he will order you sometimes out of bed at midnight, and hurry you
away at a moment's warning: FIELDING1-1754-2,471.100

indeed, if you can sleep in his vehicle, he $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
prevent it; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.101

nay, indeed, to give him his due, this he is ordinarily disposed to
encourage; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.102

for the earlier he forces you to rise in the morning, the more time
he will give you in the heat of the day, sometimes even fix hours at an
alehouse, or at their doors, where he always gives you the same indulgence
which he allows himself; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.103

and for this he is generally very moderate, in his demands.
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.104

I have known a whole bundle of passengers charged no more than half
a crown for being suffered to remain quiet at an alehouse door,
for above a whole hour, and that even in the hottest day in summer.
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.105

But as this kind of tyranny, though it hath escaped our political writers
, hath been, I think, touched by our dramatic, and is more trite among the
generality of readers; and as this and all other kinds of such subjection
are alike unknown to my friends, I will quit the passengers by land,
and treat of those who travel by water; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.106

for whatever is said on this subject is applicable to both alike,
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.107

and we may bring them together as closely as they are brought in the
liturgy, when they are recommended to the prayers of all Christian
congregations; and <paren> which I have often thought very remarkable
<$$paren> where they are joined with other miserable wretches, such
as , women in labour, people in sickness, infants just born, prisoners
and captives.  FIELDING1-1754-2,471.108

Goods and passengers are conveyed by water in divers vehicles, the
principal of which being a ship, it shall suffice to mention that alone.
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.109

Here the tyrant doth not derive his title, as the stage-coachman doth
from the vehicle itself, in which he stows his goods and passengers,
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.110

but he is called the captain; a word of such various use and uncertain
signification, that it seems very difficult to fix any positive idea to
it: FIELDING1-1754-2,471.111

if, indeed, there be any general meaning which may comprehend all its
different uses, that of the head, or chief, of any body of men, seems
to be most capable of this comprehension; FIELDING1-1754-2,471.112

for whether they be a company of soldiers, a crew of sailors, or a gang
of rogues, he who is at the head of them is always stiled the captain.
FIELDING1-1754-2,471.113

The particular tyrant, whose fortune it was to stow us aboard, laid a
farther claim to this appellation than the bare command of a vehicle
of conveyance.  FIELDING1-1754-2,471.114

He had been the captain of a privateer, which he chose to call being in
the king's service, FIELDING1-1754-2,471.115

and thence derived a right of hoisting the military ornament of a cockade
over the button of his hat.  FIELDING1-1754-2,471.116

<P_472>

He likewise wore a sword of no ordinary length by his side, with which
he swaggered in his cabin, among the wretches his passengers, whom he
had stowed in cupboards on each side.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.118

He was a person of a very singular character.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.119

He had taken it into his head that he was a gentleman, from those
very reasons that proved he was not one; and to shew himself a fine
gentleman, by a behaviour which seemed to insinuate he had never seen one.
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.120

He was, moreover, a man of gallantry; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.121

at the age of seventy, he had the sinicalness of Sir Courtly Nice,
with the roughness of Surly FIELDING1-1754-2,472.122

and while he was deaf himself, had a voice capable of deafening all
others.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.123

Now, as I saw myself in danger by the delays of the captain, who was, in
reality, waiting for more freight, and as the wind had been long nested,
as it were, in the south-west, where it constantly blew hurricanes,
I began with great reason to apprehend that our voyage might be long,
and that my belly, which began already to be much extended, would require
the water to be let out at a time when no assistance was at hand; though,
indeed, the captain comforted me with assurances, that he had a pretty
young fellow on board, who acted as his surgeon , as I found he likewise
did as steward, cook, butler, sailor.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.124

In short, he had as many offices as Scrub in the play,
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.125

and went through them all with great dexterity FIELDING1-1754-2,472.126

this of surgeon, was, perhaps, the only one in which his skill was
somewhat deficient, at least that branch of tapping for the dropsy;
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.127

for he very ingenuously and modestly confessed, he had never seen the
operation performed, nor was possessed of that chirurgical instrument
with which it is performed.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.128

Friday, June 28.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.129

By way of prevention, therefore, I this day sent for my friend
Mr. Hunter, the great surgeon and anatomist of Covent-garden;
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.130

and, though my belly was not yet very full and tight, let out ten quarts
of water; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.131

the young sea-surgeon attended the operation, not as a performer, but
as a student.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.132

I was now eased of the greatest apprehension which I had from the length
of the passage; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.133

and I told the captain, I was become indifferent as to the time of
his sailing.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.134

He expressed much satisfaction in this declaration, and at hearing from
me, that I found myself, since my tapping, much lighter and better.
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.135

In this, I believe, he was sincere; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.136

for, he was, as we shall have occasion to observe more than once, a very
good-natured man; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.137

and as he was a very brave one too, I found that the heroic constancy
, with which I had borne an operation that is attended with scarce
any degree of pain, had not a little raised me in his esteem.
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.138

That he might adhere, therefore, in the most religious and rigorous
manner to his word, when he had no longer any temptation from interest
to break it, as he had no longer any hopes of more goods or passengers ,
he ordered his ship to fall down to Gravesend on Sunday morning, and
there to wait his arrival.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.139

Sunday, June 30, FIELDING1-1754-2,472.140

Nothing worth notice passed till that morning, when my poor wife, after
passing a night in the Utmost torments of the tooth-ach, resolved to
have it drawn.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.141

I dispatched, therefore, a servant into Wapping, to bring, in haste,
the best tooth-drawer he could find.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.142

He soon found out a female of great eminence in the art;
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.143

but when he brought her to the boat, at the water-side, they were informed
that the ship was gone; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.144

for, indeed, she had set out a few minutes after his quitting her;
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.145

nor did the pilot, who well knew the errand on which I had sent my
servant, think fit to wait a moment for his return, or to give me any
notice of his setting out, though I had, very patiently, attended the
delays of the captain four days, after many solemn promises of weighing
anchor every one of the three last.  FIELDING1-1754-2,472.146

But of all the petty bashaws, or turbulent tyrants I ever beheld,
this soure-faced pilot was the $worst-tempered {TEXT:worst_tempered}
; FIELDING1-1754-2,472.147

for, during the time that he had the guidance of the ship, which
was till we arrived in the Downs, he complied with no one's desires,
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.148

nor did he give a civil word, or, indeed, a civil look to any on board.
FIELDING1-1754-2,472.149

<P_473>

The toothdrawer, who, as I said before, was one of great eminence among
her neighbours, refused to follow the ship; so that my man made himself
the best of his way, and, with some difficulty, came up with us before
we were got under full sail; FIELDING1-1754-2,473.151

for, after that, as we had both wind and tide with us, he would have
found it impossible to overtake the ship, till she was come to an anchor
at Gravesend.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.152

The morning was fair and bright, FIELDING1-1754-2,473.153

and we had a passage thither, I think, as pleasant as can be conceived ;
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.154

for, take it with all its advantages, particularly the number of fine
ships you are always sure of seeing by the way, there is nothing to
equal it in all the rivers of the world.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.155

The yards of Deptford and of Woolwich are noble sights;
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.156

and give us a just idea of the great perfection to which we are arrived
in building those floating castles, and the figure which we may always
make in Europe among the other maritime powers.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.157

That of Woolwich, at least, very strongly imprinted this idea on my mind;
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.158

for, there was now on the stocks there the Royal Anne, supposed to be
the largest ship ever built, and which contains ten carriage guns more
than had ever yet equipped a first rate.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.159

It is true, perhaps, that there is more of ostentation than of real
utility, in ships of this vast and unwieldy burthen, which are rarely
capable of acting against an enemy; FIELDING1-1754-2,473.160

but if the building such contributes to preserve, among other nations,
the notion of the British superiority in naval affairs, the expence,
though very great, is well incurred, FIELDING1-1754-2,473.161

and the ostentation is laudable and truly political.
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.162

Indeed, I should be sorry to allow that Holland, France, or Spain,
possessed a vessel larger and more beautiful than the largest and most
beautiful of ours; FIELDING1-1754-2,473.163

for this honour I would always administer to the pride of our sailors,
who should challenge it from all their neighbours with truth and success.
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.164

And sure I am that not our honest tars alone, but every inhabitant of
this island, may exult in the comparison, when he considers the king of
Great-Britain as a maritime prince, in opposition to any other prince
in Europe; FIELDING1-1754-2,473.165

but I am not so certain that the same idea of superiority will result
from comparing our land-forces with those of many other crowned heads.
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.166

In numbers, they all far exceed us, FIELDING1-1754-2,473.167

and in the goodness and splendor of their troops, many nations,
particularly the Germans and French, and perhaps the Dutch, cast us at
a distance FIELDING1-1754-2,473.168

for, however we may flatter ourselves with the Edwards and Henrys
of former ages, the change of the whole art of war since those days,
by which the advantage of personal strength is, in a manner, entirely
lost, hath produced a change in military affairs to the advantage of
our enemies.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.169

As for our successes in later days, if they were not entirely owing to
the superior genius of our general, they were not a little due to the
superior force of his money.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.170

Indeed, if we should arraign marshal Saxe of ostentation, when he shewed
his army, drawn up, to our captive general, the day after the battle of
La Val, we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that the ostentation was entirely
vain; since he certainly shewed him an army, which had not been often
equalled, either in the number or goodness of the troops, and which,
in those respects, so far exceeded ours, that none can ever cast any
reflexion on the brave young prince who could not reap the lawrels of
conquest in that day; but his retreat will be always mentioned as an
addition to his glory.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.171

In our marine the case is entirely the reverse, FIELDING1-1754-2,473.172

and it must be our own fault if it doth not continue so;
FIELDING1-1754-2,473.173

for continue so it will, as long as the florishing state of our trade
shall support it, FIELDING1-1754-2,473.174

and this support it can never want, till our legislature shall cease
to give sufficient attention to the protection of our trade, and our
magistrates want sufficient power, ability, and honesty to execute the
laws: a circumstance not to be apprehended, as it $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
happen, till our senates and our benches shall be filled with the blindest
ignorance, or with the blackest corruption.  FIELDING1-1754-2,473.175

<P_474>

Besides the ships in the docks, we saw many on the water:
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.177

the yatchts are sights of great parade, FIELDING1-1754-2,474.178

and the king's body yatcht, is, I believe, unequalled in any country ,
for convenience as well as magnificence; both which are consulted in
building and equipping her with the most exquisite art and workmanship.
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.179

We saw likewise several Indiamen just returned from their voyage.
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.180

These are, I believe, the largest and finest vessels which are any where
employed in commercial affairs.  FIELDING1-1754-2,474.181

The colliers, likewise, which are very numerous, and even assemble in
sleets, are ships of great bulk; FIELDING1-1754-2,474.182

and, if we descend to those used in the American, African, and European
trades, and pass through those which visit our own coasts, to the small
craft: that ly between Chatham and the Tower, the whole forms a most
pleasing object to the eye, as well as highly warming to the heart of an
Englishman, who has any degree of love for his country, or can recognize
any effect of the patriot in his constitution.  FIELDING1-1754-2,474.183

Lastly, the Royal Hospital of Greenwich, which presents so delightful a
front to the water, and doth such honour at once to its builder and the
nation, to the great skill and ingenuity of the one, and to the no less
sensible gratitude of the other, very properly closes the account of this
scene; which may well appear romantic to those who have not themselves
seen, that, in this one instance, truth and reality are capable, perhaps,
of exceeding the power of fiction.  FIELDING1-1754-2,474.184

When we had past {COM:sic_here_and_passim} by Greenwich, we saw only
two or three gentlemen's houses, all of very moderate account, till we
reached Gravesend; FIELDING1-1754-2,474.185

these are all on the Kentish shore, which affords a much drier,
wholesomer and pleasanter situation than doth that of opposite, Essex.
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.186

This circumstance, I own, is somewhat surprising to me, when I reflect
on the numerous villas that crowd the river, from Chelsea upwards as
far as Shepperton, where the narrower channel affords not half so noble
a prospect, and where the continual succession of the small craft, like
the frequent repetition of all things, which have nothing in them great,
beautiful, or admirable, tire the eye, and give us distaste and aversion
instead of pleasure.  FIELDING1-1754-2,474.187

With some of these situations, such as Barnes, Mortlake, &c.
even the shore of Essex might contend, not upon very unequal terms;
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.188

but, on the Kentish borders, there are many spots to be chosen by the
builder, which might justly claim the preference over almost the very
finest of those in Middlesex and Surrey.  FIELDING1-1754-2,474.189

How shall we account for this depravity in taste?
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.190

for, surely, there are none so very mean and contemptible, as to bring
the pleasure of seeing a number of little wherries, gliding along after
one another, in competition with what we enjoy, in viewing a succession
of ships, with all their sails expanded to the winds, bounding over the
waves before us.  FIELDING1-1754-2,474.191

And here I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} pass by another observation on the
deplorable want of taste in our enjoyments, which we shew by almost
totally neglecting the pursuit of what seems to me the highest degree
of amusement: FIELDING1-1754-2,474.192

this is, the sailing ourselves in little vessels of our own, contrived
only for our ease and accommodation, to which such situations of our
villas, as I have recommended, would be so convenient and even necessary.
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.193

This amusement, I confess, if enjoyed in any perfection, would be of
the expensive kind; FIELDING1-1754-2,474.194

but such expence would not exceed the reach of a moderate fortune,
FIELDING1-1754-2,474.195

and would fall very short of the prices which are daily paid for pleasures
of a far inferior rate, FIELDING1-1754-2,474.196

the truth, I believe, is, that sailing in the manner I have just
mentioned, is a pleasure rather unknown, or unthought of, than rejected
by those who have experienced it; unless, perhaps, the apprehension of
danger, or sea sickness, may be supposed, by the timorous and delicate ,
to make too large deductions; insisting, that all their enjoyments shall
come to them pure and unmixed, and being ever ready to cry out, <font>
Nocet empta dolore voluptas.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1754-2,474.197

<P_475>

This, however, was my present case; FIELDING1-1754-2,475.199

for the ease and lightness which I felt from my tapping, the gaiety
of the morning, the pleasant sailing with wind and tide, and the many
agreeable objects with which I was constantly entertained during the
whole way, were all suppressed and overcome by the single consideration
of my wife's pain, which continued incessantly to torment her till we
came to an anchor, when I dispatched a messenger in great haste, for
the best reputed operator in Gravesend.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.200

A surgeon of some eminence now appeared, who did not decline
tooth-drawing, though he certainly would have been offended with the
appellation of tooth-drawer, no less than his brethren, the members
of that venerable body, would be with that of barber, since the late
separation between those long united companies, by which, if the surgeons
have gained much, the barbers are supposed to have lost very little.
FIELDING1-1754-2,475.201

This able and careful person <paren> for so I sincerely believe he
is <$$paren> after examining the guilty tooth, declared, that it
was such a rotten shell, and so placed at the very remotest end of
the upper jaw, where it was, in a manner, covered and secured by a
large, fine, firm tooth, that he despaired of his power of drawing it.
FIELDING1-1754-2,475.202

He said, indeed, more to my wife, FIELDING1-1754-2,475.203

and used more rhetoric to dissuade her from having it drawn, than is
generally employed to persuade young ladies, to prefer a pain of three
moments to one of three months continuance; especially, if those young
ladies happen to be past forty and fifty years of age, when, by submitting
to support a racking torment, the only good circumstance attending which
is, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} so short, that scarce one in a thousand can cry
out, I feel it, they are to do a violence to their charms, and lose one
of those beautiful holders, with which alone Sir Courtly Nice declares,
a lady can ever lay hold of his heart.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.204

He said at last so much, FIELDING1-1754-2,475.205

and seemed to reason so justly, that I came over to his side, and
assisted him in prevailing on my wife <paren> for it was no easy matter
<$$paren> to resolve on keeping her tooth a little longer, and to apply
to palliatives only for relief.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.206

These were opium applied to the tooth, and blisters behind the ears.
FIELDING1-1754-2,475.207

Whilst we were at dinner this day, in the cabin, on a sudden the window
on one side was beat into the room, with a crash, as if a twenty-pounder
had been discharged among us.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.208

We were all alarmed at the suddenness of the accident, for which, however,
we were soon able to account: FIELDING1-1754-2,475.209

for the sash, which was shivered all to pieces, was pursued into the
middle of the cabin by the bowsprit of a little ship, called a cod-smack ,
the master of which made us amends for running <paren> carelesly at best
<$$paren> against us, and injuring the ship, in the sea way; that is to
say, by damning us all to hell, and uttering several pious wishes that
it had done us much more mischief.  All which were answered in their own
kind and phrase by our men; between whom, and the other crew, a dialogue
of oaths and scurrility was carried on, as long as they continued in
each other's hearing.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.210

It is difficult, I think, to assign a satisfactory reason why sailors in
general should, of all others, think themselves entirely discharged from
the common bands of'humanity, and should seem to glory in the language
and behaviour of savages?  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.211

They see more of the world, FIELDING1-1754-2,475.212

and have, most of them, a more erudite education, than is the portion
of land-men of their degree.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.213

Nor do I believe that in any country they visit <paren> Holland itself
not excepted <$$paren> they can ever find a parallel to what daily passes
on the river Thames.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.214

Is it that they think true courage <paren> for they are the bravest
fellows upon earth <$$paren> inconsistent with all the gentleness of a
humane carriage, and that the contempt of civil order springs up in minds
but little cultivated at the same time, and from the same principles,
with the contempt of danger and death?  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.215

Is it?  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.216

In short, it is so; FIELDING1-1754-2,475.217

and how it comes to be so, I leave to form a question in the Robin Hood
society, or to be propounded for solution among the aenigmas in the
Woman's Almanack for the next year.  FIELDING1-1754-2,475.218

<P_476>

<font> Monday, July <$$font> I FIELDING1-1754-2,476.220

This day Mr. Welch took his leave of me after dinner, as did a
young lady of her sister, who was proceeding with my wife to Lisbon.
FIELDING1-1754-2,476.221

They both set out together in a post-chaise for London.
FIELDING1-1754-2,476.222

Soon after their departure, our cabin where my wife and I were sitting
together, was visited by two ruffians, whose appearance greatly
corresponded with that of the sheriff's, rather the knight marshal's
bailiffs.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.223

One of these, especially, who seemed to affect a more than ordinary
degree of rudeness and insolence, came in without any kind of ceremony,
with a broad gold lace on his hat, which was cocked with much military
fierceness on his head.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.224

An inkhorn at his buttonhole, and some papers in his hand, sufficiently
assured me what he was, FIELDING1-1754-2,476.225

and I asked him if he and his companion were not custom-house officers;
FIELDING1-1754-2,476.226

he answered with sufficient dignity, that they were, as an information
which he seemed to conclude would strike the hearer with awe, and suppress
all further enquiry; FIELDING1-1754-2,476.227

but, on the contrary, I proceeded to ask of what rank he was in the
Custom-house, FIELDING1-1754-2,476.228

and receiving an answer from his companion, as I remember, that the
gentleman was a riding surveyor; I replied that he might be a riding
surveyor, but could be no gentleman, for that none who had any title to
that denomination, would break into the presence of a lady, without any
apology, or even moving his hat.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.229

He then took his covering from his head, FIELDING1-1754-2,476.230

and laid it on the table, saying, he asked pardon, and blamed the mate
, who should, he said, have informed him if any persons of distinction
were below.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.231

I told him, he might guess by our appearance <paren> which, perhaps,
was rather more than could be said with the strictest adherence to truth
<$$paren> that he was before a gentleman and lady, which should teach
him to be very civil in his behaviour, though we should not happen to be
of that number whom the world calls people of fashion and distinction.
FIELDING1-1754-2,476.232

However, I said, that as he seemed sensible of his error, and had asked
pardon, the lady would permit him to put his hat on again, if he chose it.
FIELDING1-1754-2,476.233

This he refused with some degree of surliness, FIELDING1-1754-2,476.234

and failed not to convince me that, if I should condescend to become
more gentle, he would soon grow more rude.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.235

I now renewed a Reflexion, which I have often seen occasion to make,
that there is nothing so incongruous in nature as any kind of power, with
lowness of mind and of ability, and that there is nothing more deplorable
than the want of truth in the whimsical notion of Plato; who tells us
that Saturn, well knowing the state of human affairs, gave us kings and
rulers, not of human, but divine original; FIELDING1-1754-2,476.236

for as we make not shepherds of sheep, nor oxherds of oxen, nor goatherds
of goats; but place some of our own kind over all, as being better and
fitter to govern them: in the same manner, were demons by the Divine Love,
set over us, as a race of beings of a superior order to men, and who, with
great ease to themselves, might regulate our affairs, and establish peace,
modesty, freedom, and justice.  And totally destroying all sedition,
might complete the happiness of the human race.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.237

So far, at least, may even now be said with truth, that in all states
which are under the government of mere man, without any divine
assistance, there is nothing but labour and misery to be found.
FIELDING1-1754-2,476.238

From what I have said therefore, we may at least learn, with our utmost
endeavours, to imitate the Saturnian institution; FIELDING1-1754-2,476.239

borrowing all assistance from our immortal part, while we pay to this
the strictest obedience, we should form both our private economy, and
public policy, from its dictates.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.240

By this dispensation of our immortal minds, we are to establish a law,
and to call it by that name.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.241

But if any government be in the hands of a single person, of the few,
or of the many; and such governor or governors shall abandon himself
or themselves to the unbridled pursuit of the wildest pleasures or
desires, unable to restrain any passion, but possessed with an insatiable
bad disease; if such shall attempt to govern; and at the same time to
trample on all laws, there can be no means of Preservation left for the
wretched people.  FIELDING1-1754-2,476.242

<P_477>

It is true that Plato is here treating of the highest of sovereign power
in a state; FIELDING1-1754-2,477.244

but it is as true, that his observations are general, and may be applied
to all inferior powers: FIELDING1-1754-2,477.245

and, indeed, every subordinate degree is immediately derived from the
highest; FIELDING1-1754-2,477.246

and as it is equally protected by the same force, and sanctifyed by the
same authority, is alike dangerous to the well-being of the subject.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.247

Of all powers, perhaps, there is none so sanctified and protected, as
this which is under our present consideration.  FIELDING1-1754-2,477.248

So numerous, indeed, and strong are the sanctions given to it by many
acts of parliament, that having once established the laws of customs on
merchandize, it seems to have been the sole view of the legislature to
strengthen the hands, and to protect the persons of the officers, who
became established by those laws; many of whom are so far from bearing
any resemblance to the Saturnian institution, and to be chosen from a
degree of beings superior to the rest of human race, that they sometimes
seem industriously picked out of the lowest and vilest orders of mankind.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.249

There is, indeed, nothing so useful to man in general, nor so
beneficial to particular societies and individuals, as trade.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.250

This is that <font> alma mater, <$$font> at whose plentiful breast all
mankind are nourished.  FIELDING1-1754-2,477.251

It is true, like other parents, she is not always equally indulgent to
all her children; FIELDING1-1754-2,477.252

but though she gives to her favourites a vast proportion of
redundancy and superfluity, there are very few whom she refuses to
supply with the conveniences, and none with the necessaries of life.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.253

Such a benefactress as this must naturally be beloved by mankind in
general; FIELDING1-1754-2,477.254

it would be wonderful, therefore, if her interest was not considered
by them, and protected from the fraud and violence of some of her
rebellious offspring, who coveting more than their share, or more than she
thinks proper to allow them, are daily employed in meditating mischief
against her, and in endeavouring to steal from their brethren those
shares which this great <font> alma mater <$$font> had allowed them.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.255

At length our governor came on board, FIELDING1-1754-2,477.256

and about six in the evening we weighed anchor, FIELDING1-1754-2,477.257

and fell down to the Nore, whither our passage was extremely pleasant,
the evening being very delightful, the moon just past the full, and both
wind and tide favourable to us.  FIELDING1-1754-2,477.258

<font> Tuesday, July 2.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1754-2,477.259

This morning we again set sail under all the advantages we had enjoyed
the evening before: FIELDING1-1754-2,477.260

this day we left the shore of Essex, FIELDING1-1754-2,477.261

and coasted along Kent, passing by the pleasant island of Thanet,
which is an island, and that of Sheppy, which is not an island,
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.262

and about three o'clock, the wind being now full in our teeth,
we came to an anchor in the Downs, within two miles of Deal.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.263

My wife, having suffered intolerable pain from her tooth, again renewed
her resolution of having it drawn, FIELDING1-1754-2,477.264

and another surgeon was sent for from Deal, but with no better success
than the former.  FIELDING1-1754-2,477.265

He likewise declined the operation, for the same reason which had been
assigned by the former: FIELDING1-1754-2,477.266

however, such was her resolution, backed with pain, that he was obliged
to make the attempt, which concluded more in honour of his judgment,
than of his operation; FIELDING1-1754-2,477.267

for after having put my poor wife to inexpressible torment, he was obliged
to leave her tooth <font> in statu quo; <$$font> FIELDING1-1754-2,477.268

and she had now the comfortable prospect of a long fit of pain, which
might have lasted her whole voyage, without any possibility of relief.
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.269

In these pleasing sensations, of which I had my just share, nature ,
overcome with fatigue, about eight in the evening resigned her to
rest; a circumstance which would have given me some happiness, could
I have known how to employ those spirits which were raised by it:
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.270

but unfortunately for me, I was left in a disposition of enjoying an
agreeable hour, without the assistance of a companion, which has always
appeared to me necessary to such enjoyment; FIELDING1-1754-2,477.271

my daughter and her companion were both retired sea-sick to bed;
FIELDING1-1754-2,477.272

the other passengers were a rude school-boy of fourteen years old, and an
illiterate <P_478> Portuguese friar, who understood no language but his
own, in which I had not the least smattering.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.273

The captain was the only person left, in whose conversation I might
indulge myself; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.274

but unluckily, besides a total ignorance of every thing in the world but
a ship, he had the misfortune of being so deaf, that to make him hear,
I will not say understand, my words, I must run the risque of conveying
them to the ears of my wife, who, though in another room <paren>
called, I think, the state-room; being indeed a most stately apartment
capable of containing one human body in length, if not very tall,
and three bodies in breadth <$$paren> lay asleep within a yard of me.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.275

In this situation necessity and choice were one and the same thing;
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.276

the captain and I sat down together to a small bowl of punch, over
which we both soon fell fast asleep, and so concluded the evening.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.277

<font> Wednesday, July <$$font> 3.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.278

This morning I awaked at four o'clock, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.279

for my distemper seldom suffered me to sleep later.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.280

I presently got up, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.281

and had the pleasure of enjoying the sight of a tempestuous sea for four
hours before the captain was stirring; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.282

for he loved to indulge himself in morning slumbers, which were attended
with a wind musick, much more agreeable to the performers than to the
hearers, especially such as have, as I had, the privilege of sitting in
the orchestra.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.283

At eight o'clock the captain rose, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.284

and sent his boat on shore; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.285

I ordered my man likewise to go in it, as my distemper was not of that
kind which entirely deprives us of appetite.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.286

Now, though the captain had well victualled his ship with all manner
of salt provisions for the voyage, and had added great quantities of
fresh stores, particularly of vegetables at Gravesend, such as beans
and peas, which had been on board only two days, and had, possibly,
not been gathered above two more, I apprehended I could provide
better for myself at Deal, than the ship's ordinary seemed to promise.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.287

I accordingly sent for fresh provisions of all kinds from the shore,
in order to put off the evil day of starving as long as possible.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.288

My man returned with most of the articles I sent for,
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.289

and I now thought myself in a condition of living a week on my own
provisions.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.290

I therefore ordered my own dinner, which I wanted nothing but a cook to
dress, and a proper fire to dress it at; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.291

but those were not to be had, nor indeed any addition to my roast mutton
, except the pleasure of the captain's company, with that of the other
passengers; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.292

for my wife continued the whole day in a state of dozing,
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.293

and my other females, whose sickness did not abate by the rolling of
the ship at anchor, seemed more inclined to empty their stomachs than
to fill them.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.294

Thus I passed the whole day <paren> except about an hour at dinner
<$$paren> by myself, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.295

and the evening concluded with the captain as the preceding one had done
; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.296

one comfortable piece of news he communicated to me, which was , that he
had no doubt of a prosperous wind in the morning; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.297

but as he did not divulge the reasons of this confidence, and as I
saw none myself besides the wind being directly opposite, my faith
in this prophecy was not strong enough to build any great hopes upon.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.298

<font> Thursday, July <$$font> 4.  FIELDING1-1754-2,478.299

This morning, however, the captain seemed resolved to fulfil his own
predictions, whether the wind would or no; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.300

he accordingly weighed anchor, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.301

and taking the advantage of the tide, when the wind was not very
boisterous, he hoisted his sails, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.302

and, as if his power had been no less absolute over Eolus than it was
over Neptune, he forced the wind to blow him on in its own despight.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.303

But as all men who have ever been at sea, well know how weak such attempts
are, and want no authorities of Scripture to prove, that the most absolute
power of a captain of a ship is very contemptible in the wind's eye,
so did it befal our noble commander, who having struggled with the wind
three or four hours, was obliged to give over, and lost, in a few minutes,
all that he had been so long a gaining; FIELDING1-1754-2,478.304

in short, we returned to our former station, FIELDING1-1754-2,478.305

and once more cast anchor in the neighbourhood of Deal.
FIELDING1-1754-2,478.306

<P_479>

Here, though we lay near the shore, that we might promise ourselves all
the emolument which could be derived from it, we found ourselves deceived;
and that we might with as much conveniency be out of the sight of land;
FIELDING1-1754-2,479.308

for, except when the captain launched forth his own boat, which he did
always with great reluctance, we were incapable of procuring any thing
from Deal, but at a price too exorbitant, and beyond the reach even
of modern luxury; the fair of a boat from Deal, which lay at two miles
distance, being at least three half crowns, and if we had been in any
distress for it, as many half guineas; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.309

for these good people consider the sea as a large common, appendant
to their manor, in which, when they find any of their fellow creatures
impounded, they conclude, that they have a full right of making them pay
at their own discretion for their deliverance: FIELDING1-1754-2,479.310

to say the truth, whether it be that men, who live on the sea-shore,
are of an amphibious kind, and do not entirely partake of human nature,
or whatever else may be the reason, they are so far from taking any share
in the distresses of mankind, or of being moved with any compassion for
them, that they look upon them as blessings showered down from above;
and which the more they improve to their own use, the greater is their
gratitude and piety.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.311

Thus at Gravesend, a sculler requires a shilling for going less way than
he would row in London for three pence; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.312

and, at Deal, a boat often brings more profit in a day, than
it can produce in London in a week, or, perhaps, in a month,
FIELDING1-1754-2,479.313

in both places, the owner of the boat founds his demand on the necessity
and distress of one, who stands more or less in absolute want of his
assistance; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.314

and with the urgency of these, always rises in the exorbitancy of his
demand, without ever considering, that, from these very circumstances
, the power or ease of gratifying such demand is in like proportion
lessened.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.315

Now, as I am unwilling that some conclusions, which may be, I am
aware, too justly drawn from these observations, should be imputed to
human nature in general, I have endeavoured to account for them in
a way more consistent with the goodness and dignity of that nature:
FIELDING1-1754-2,479.316

however it be, it seems a little to reflect on the governors of such
monsters, that they do not take some means to restrain these impositions
, and prevent them from triumphing any longer in the miseries of those,
who are, in many circumstances at least, their fellow creatures, and
considering the distresses of a wretched seaman, from his being wrecked
to his being barely wind bound, as a blessing sent among them from above ,
and calling it by that blasphemous name.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.317

<font> Friday, July <$$font> 5.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.318

This day I sent a servant on board a man of war, that was stationed here
, with my compliments to the captain, to represent to him the distress
of the ladies, and to desire the favour of his long-boat to conduct us
to Dover, at about seven miles distance; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.319

and, at the same time, presumed to make use of a great lady's name,
the wife of the first lord commissioner of the admiralty; who would,
I told him, be pleased with any kindness shewn by him towards us in our
miserable condition.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.320

And this I am convinced was true, from the humanity of the lady, though
she was entirely unknown to me.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.321

The captain returned a verbal answer to a long letter; acquainting me,
that what I desired could not be complied with, it being a favour not
in his power to grant.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.322

This might be, and I suppose was true; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.323

but it is as true, that if he was able to write, and had pen, ink, and
paper aboard, he might have sent a written answer, and that it was the
part of a gentleman so to have done; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.324

but this is a character seldom maintained on the watery
element, especially by those who exercise any power on it.
FIELDING1-1754-2,479.325

Every commander of a vessel here seems to think himself entirely free
from all those rules of decency and civility, which direct and restrain
the conduct of the members of a society on shore; FIELDING1-1754-2,479.326

and each, claiming absolute dominion in his little wooden world, rules
by his own laws and his own discretion.  FIELDING1-1754-2,479.327

I do not, indeed, know so pregnant an instance of the dangerous
consequences of absolute power, and it's aptness to intoxicate the mind,
as that of <P_480> those petty tyrants, who become such in a moment, from
very well-disposed and social members of that communion, in which they
affect no superiority, but live in an orderly state of legal subjection
with their fellow-citizens.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.328

<font> Saturday, July <$$font> 6.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.329

This morning our commander, declaring he was sure the wind would change,
took the advantage of an ebbing tide, FIELDING1-1754-2,480.330

and weighed his anchor.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.331

His assurance, however, had the same completion, and his endeavours the
same success, with his former trial FIELDING1-1754-2,480.332

and he was soon obliged to return once more to his old quarters.
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.333

Just before we let go our anchor, a small sloop, rather than submit to
yield us an inch of way, ran foul of our ship, FIELDING1-1754-2,480.334

and carried off her bowsprit.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.335

This obstinate frolic would have cost those aboard the sloop very dear,
if our steersman had not been too generous to exert his superiority,
the certain consequence of which would have been the immediate sinking
of the other.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.336

This contention of the inferior, with a might capable of crushing it
in an instant, may seem to argue no small share of folly or madness,
as well as of impudence; FIELDING1-1754-2,480.337

but I am convinced there is very little danger in it:
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.338

contempt is a port to which the pride of man submits to fly with
reluctance, FIELDING1-1754-2,480.339

but those who are within it are always in a place of the most assured
security; FIELDING1-1754-2,480.340

for whosoever throws away his sword, prefers, indeed, a less honourable
, but much safer means of avoiding danger, than he who defends himself
with it.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.341

And here we shall offer another distinction, of the truth of which
much reading and experience have well convinced us, that as in the most
absolute governments, there is a regular progression of slavery downwards,
from the top to the bottom, the mischief of which is seldom felt with
any great force and bitterness, but by the next immediate degree; so
in the most dissolute and anarchical states, there is as regular an
ascent of what is called rank or condition, which is always laying hold
of the head of him, who is advanced but one step higher on the ladder,
who might, if he did not too much despise such efforts, kick his pursuer
head-long to the bottom.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.342

We will conclude this digression with one general and short observation,
which will, perhaps, set the whole matter in a clearer light than the
longest and most laboured harangue.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.343

Whereas envy of all things most exposes us to danger from
others; so, contempt of all things best secures us from them.
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.344

And thus, while the dungcart and the sloop are always meditating
mischief against the coach and the ship, and throwing themselves
designedly in their way, the latter consider only their own security,
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.345

and are not ashamed to break the road, and let the other pass by them.
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.346

<font> Monday, July <$$font> 8.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.347

Having past our Sunday without any thing remarkable, unless the catching
a great number of whitings in the afternoon may $be {TEXT:b} thought so
; we now set sail on Monday at six o'clock, with a little variation of
wind; FIELDING1-1754-2,480.348

but this was so very little, and the breeze itself so small, that the tide
was our best, and indeed almost our only friend.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.349

This conducted us along the short remainder of the Kentish shore.
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.350

Here we past that cliff of Dover, which makes so tremendous a figure in
Shakespear, and which, whoever reads without being giddy, must, according
to Mr. Addison's observation, have either a very good head, or
a very bad one; but, which, whoever contracts any such ideas from the
sight of, must have, at least, a poetic, if not a Shakespearian genius.
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.351

In truth, mountains, rivers, heroes, and gods owe great part of their
existence to the poets; FIELDING1-1754-2,480.352

and Greece and Italy do so plentifully abound in the former, because
they furnished so glorious a number of the latter; who, while they
bestowed immortality on every little hillock and blind stream, left the
noblest rivers and mountains in the world to share the same obscurity
with the eastern and western poets, in which they are celebrated.
FIELDING1-1754-2,480.353

This evening we beat the sea off Sussex, in sight of Dungeness, with
much more pleasure than progress; FIELDING1-1754-2,480.354

for the weather was almost a perfect calm, FIELDING1-1754-2,480.355

and the moon, which was almost at the full, scarce suffered a single
cloud to veil her from our sight.  FIELDING1-1754-2,480.356

<P_481>

<font> Tuesday, Wednesday, July <$$font> 9, 10.  FIELDING1-1754-2,481.358

These two days we had much the same fine weather, FIELDING1-1754-2,481.359

and made much the same way; FIELDING1-1754-2,481.360

but, in the evening of the latter day, a pretty fresh gale sprung up ,
at N.N.W.  which brought us by the morning in sight of the Isle of Wight.
FIELDING1-1754-2,481.361

<font> Thursday, July <$$font> 11.  FIELDING1-1754-2,481.362

This gale continued till towards noon; when the east end of the island
bore but little a-head of us.  FIELDING1-1754-2,481.363

The captain swaggered, FIELDING1-1754-2,481.364

and declared he would keep the sea; FIELDING1-1754-2,481.365

but the wind got the better of him, so that about three he gave up the
victory, and, making a sudden tack, stood in for the shore, passed by
Spithead and Portsmouth, and came to an anchor at a place called Ryde
on the island.  FIELDING1-1754-2,481.366

A most tragical incident fell out this day at sea.
FIELDING1-1754-2,481.367

While the ship was under sail, but making, as will appear, no great way,
a kitten, one of four of the feline inhabitants of the cabin, fell from
the window into the water: FIELDING1-1754-2,481.368

an alarm was immediately given to the captain, who was then upon
deck, and received it with the utmost concern and many bitter oaths.
FIELDING1-1754-2,481.369

He immediately gave orders to the steersman in favour of the poor thing,
as he called it; FIELDING1-1754-2,481.370

the sails were instantly slackened, and all hands, as the phrase is,
employed to recover the poor animal.  FIELDING1-1754-2,481.371

I was, I own, extremely surprised at all this; less, indeed, at the
captain's extreme tenderness, than at his conceiving any possibility of
success; FIELDING1-1754-2,481.372

for, if puss had had nine thousand, instead of nine lives, I concluded
they had been all lost.  FIELDING1-1754-2,481.373
