The Champion of Virtue.  REEVE-1777-1,1.3

A Gothic Story.  REEVE-1777-1,1.4

<$$heading>

In the minority of Henry the Sixth, king of England, who also was crowned
king of France, when the renowned John duke of Bedford was regent of
France, and Humphrey the good duke of Gloucester was protector of England;
a worthy knight, called sir Philip Harclay, returned from his travels,
to England, his native country.  REEVE-1777-1,1.6

- He had served under the glorious king Henry the Fifth with
distinguishing valour, REEVE-1777-1,1.7

had acquired an honourable fame, REEVE-1777-1,1.8

and was no less esteemed for christian virtues than for deeds of chivalry.
REEVE-1777-1,1.9

After the death of his prince, he entered into the service of the Greek
emperor, REEVE-1777-1,1.10

and distinguished his courage against the encroachments of the Saracens.
REEVE-1777-1,1.11

In a battle there, he took prisoner a certain gentleman, by name
M. Zadisky, of Greek extraction, but brought up by a Saracen
officer, REEVE-1777-1,1.12

this man he converted to the christian faith, after which he bound him
to himself by the tyes of friendship and gratitude, and he resolved to
continue with his benefactor.  REEVE-1777-1,1.13

After <P_2> thirty years travel and warlike service, he determined to
return to his native land, and to spend the remainder of his life in
peace, and by devoting himself to works of piety and charity, prepare
for a better state hereafter.  REEVE-1777-1,2.14

This noble knight had in his early youth contracted a strict friendship
with the only son of the lord Lovel, a gentleman of eminent virtues
and accomplishments.  REEVE-1777-1,2.15

During sir Philip's residence in foreign countries, he had frequently
written to his friend, REEVE-1777-1,2.16

and had for a time received answers, REEVE-1777-1,2.17

the last informed him of the death of the old lord Lovel, and the marriage
of the young one; REEVE-1777-1,2.18

but from that time he heard no more from him.  REEVE-1777-1,2.19

Sir Philip imputed it not to neglect or forgetfulness, but to the
difficulties of intercourse, common at that time to all travellers
and adventurers.  REEVE-1777-1,2.20

- When he was returning home, he resolved, after looking into his family
affairs, to visit the castle of Lovel, and enquire into the situation
of his friend.  REEVE-1777-1,2.21

- He landed in Kent, attended by his Greek friend and two faithful
servants, one of which was maimed by the wounds he had received in the
defence of his master.  REEVE-1777-1,2.22

- Sir Philip went to his family seat in Yorkshire, REEVE-1777-1,2.23

he found his mother and sister were dead, and his estates sequestered in
the hands of commissioners appointed by the protector.  REEVE-1777-1,2.24

- He was obliged to prove the reality of his claim, and the identity
of his person, <paren> by the testimony of some of the old servants
of his family <$$paren> after which every thing was restored to him.
REEVE-1777-1,2.25

He took possession of his own house, REEVE-1777-1,2.26

established his household, REEVE-1777-1,2.27

settled the old servants in their former stations, REEVE-1777-1,2.28

and placed those he brought home in <P_3> the upper offices of his family.
REEVE-1777-1,3.29

He left his friend to superintend his domestic affairs, REEVE-1777-1,3.30

and attended by only one of his old servants, he set out for the castle
of Lovel, in the west of England.  REEVE-1777-1,3.31

- They travelled by easy journeys, REEVE-1777-1,3.32

but towards the evening of the second day, the servant was so ill and
fatigued he could go no further, REEVE-1777-1,3.33

he stopped at an inn where he grew worse every hour, REEVE-1777-1,3.34

and the next day expired.  REEVE-1777-1,3.35

Sir Philip was under great concern for the loss of his servant, and some
for himself, being alone in a strange place; REEVE-1777-1,3.36

however he took courage, REEVE-1777-1,3.37

ordered his servant's funeral, REEVE-1777-1,3.38

attended it himself, REEVE-1777-1,3.39

and having shed a tear of humanity over his grave, proceeded alone on
his journey.  REEVE-1777-1,3.40

As he drew near the estate of his friend, he began to enquire of every
one he met, whether the lord Lovel resided at the seat of his ancestors
; REEVE-1777-1,3.41

he was answered by one, he did not know, - by another he could not tell ,
- by a third, that he never heard of such a person.  REEVE-1777-1,3.42

Sir Philip thought it strange that a man of lord Lovel's consequence
should be unknown in his own neighbourhood, and where his ancestors had
usually resided.  REEVE-1777-1,3.43

- He ruminated on the uncertainty of human happiness; REEVE-1777-1,3.44

this world, said he, has nothing for a wise man to depend upon,
REEVE-1777-1,3.45

I have lost all my relations, and most of my friends; REEVE-1777-1,3.46

and I am uncertain whether any are remaining.  REEVE-1777-1,3.47

- I will however be thankful for the blessings that are spared to me,
REEVE-1777-1,3.48

and I will endeavour to replace those that I have lost.  REEVE-1777-1,3.49

- if my friend lives he shall share my fortune while I live,
REEVE-1777-1,3.50

and his children shall have the reversion of it; REEVE-1777-1,3.51

and I will share his comforts in return.  REEVE-1777-1,3.52

- But perhaps my friend may have met <P_4> with troubles that have made
him disgusted with the world.  REEVE-1777-1,4.53

Perhaps he has buried his amiable wife, or his promising children,
and tired of public life, REEVE-1777-1,4.54

he is retired into a monastry {COM:here_and_passim_sic}, REEVE-1777-1,4.55

- at least I will know what all this silence means.  REEVE-1777-1,4.56

When he came within a mile of the castle of Lovel, he stopped at a
cottage, REEVE-1777-1,4.57

and asked for a draught of water, REEVE-1777-1,4.58

a peasant, master of the house brought it, REEVE-1777-1,4.59

and asked if his honour would alight and take a moments {COM:sic}
refreshment.  REEVE-1777-1,4.60

- Sir Philip accepted his offer, being resolved to make farther enquiry
before he approached the castle.  REEVE-1777-1,4.61

- He asked the same questions of him, that he had before to others,
REEVE-1777-1,4.62

which lord Lovel, said the man, does your honour enquire after?
REEVE-1777-1,4.63

the man whom I knew, was called Arthur, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,4.64

ay, said the peasant, he was the only surviving son of Richard, lord
Lovel as I think?  REEVE-1777-1,4.65

- very true friend, he was so.  REEVE-1777-1,4.66

- alas sir, said the man, he is dead!  REEVE-1777-1,4.67

he survived his father but a short time.  REEVE-1777-1,4.68

- dead say you.  REEVE-1777-1,4.69

- how long since?  REEVE-1777-1,4.70

- about fifteen years to the best of my remembrance.  REEVE-1777-1,4.71

- sir Philip sighed deeply - REEVE-1777-1,4.72

alas, said he, what do we by living long, but survive all our friends!
REEVE-1777-1,4.73

- but pray tell me how he died.  REEVE-1777-1,4.74

- I will sir to the best of my knowledge.  REEVE-1777-1,4.75

$An $'t {TEXT:An't} please your honour, I heard say, that he attended
the king when he went against the Welch rebels, and he left his lady
big with child; REEVE-1777-1,4.76

and so there was a battle fought, REEVE-1777-1,4.77

and the king got the better of the rebels, - REEVE-1777-1,4.78

there came first a report that none of the officers were killed,
REEVE-1777-1,4.79

but a few days after there came a messenger with an account very different
, that several were wounded, and that the lord Lovel was slain, which
sad news overset us all with <P_5> sorrow, REEVE-1777-1,5.80

for he was a noble gentleman, a bountiful master, and the delight of
all the neighbourhood.  REEVE-1777-1,5.81

- He was indeed, said sir Philip, all that is amiable and good,
REEVE-1777-1,5.82

he was my dear and noble friend, REEVE-1777-1,5.83

and I am inconsolable for his loss.  REEVE-1777-1,5.84

- but the unfortunate lady, what became of her?  REEVE-1777-1,5.85

why $an $'t {TEXT:an't} please your honour, they said she died of grief
for the loss of her husband, REEVE-1777-1,5.86

but her death was kept private for a time, REEVE-1777-1,5.87

and we did not know it for certain till some weeks afterwards -
REEVE-1777-1,5.88

The will of heaven be obeyed, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,5.89

but who succeeded to the title and estate?  REEVE-1777-1,5.90

- the next heir, said the peasant, a kinsman of the deceased, sir Walter
Lovel by name.  REEVE-1777-1,5.91

I have seen him, said sir Philip, formerly, REEVE-1777-1,5.92

but where was he when these events happened?  REEVE-1777-1,5.93

at the castle of Lovel, sir, REEVE-1777-1,5.94

he came there on a visit to the lady, REEVE-1777-1,5.95

and waited there to receive my lord, at his return from Wales;
REEVE-1777-1,5.96

when the news of his death arrived, sir Walter did every thing in his
power to comfort her, REEVE-1777-1,5.97

and some said he was to marry her, REEVE-1777-1,5.98

but she refused to be comforted, REEVE-1777-1,5.99

and took it so to heart that she died.  REEVE-1777-1,5.100

And does the present lord Lovel reside at the castle?  REEVE-1777-1,5.101

- no sir, - REEVE-1777-1,5.102

who then?  REEVE-1777-1,5.103

- the lord baron Fitz-Owen.  REEVE-1777-1,5.104

- and how came sir Walter to leave the seat of his ancestors?
REEVE-1777-1,5.105

- why sir he married his sister to this said lord, REEVE-1777-1,5.106

and so he sold the castle to him, REEVE-1777-1,5.107

and went away, REEVE-1777-1,5.108

and built himself a house in the north country, as far as Northumberland ,
I think they call it.  REEVE-1777-1,5.109

That is very strange, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,5.110

- so it is please your honour, REEVE-1777-1,5.111

but this is all I know about it - REEVE-1777-1,5.112

I thank you friend for your intelligence, REEVE-1777-1,5.113

I have taken a long journey to no purpose, REEVE-1777-1,5.114

and have met with nothing but cross accidents.  REEVE-1777-1,5.115

- This <P_6> life is indeed a pilgrimage, REEVE-1777-1,6.116

- pray direct me the nearest way to the next monastry, REEVE-1777-1,6.117

- noble sir, said the peasant, it is full five miles off,
REEVE-1777-1,6.118

the night is coming on, REEVE-1777-1,6.119

and the ways are bad; REEVE-1777-1,6.120

I am but a poor man REEVE-1777-1,6.121

and $can $not {TEXT:cannot} entertain your honour as you are used to,
REEVE-1777-1,6.122

but if you will enter my poor cottage, that, and every thing in it,
are at your service.  REEVE-1777-1,6.123

My honest friend I thank you heartily, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,6.124

your kindness and hospitality might shame many of higher birth and
breeding, REEVE-1777-1,6.125

I will accept your kind offer; REEVE-1777-1,6.126

but pray let me know the name of my host?  REEVE-1777-1,6.127

- John Wyat, sir, an honest man though a poor one, and a christian man,
though a sinful one, {COM:punctuation_sic} REEVE-1777-1,6.128

Whose cottage is this?  REEVE-1777-1,6.129

- it belongs to the lord Fitz-Owen.  REEVE-1777-1,6.130

- what family have you?  REEVE-1777-1,6.131

- a wife, two sons and a daughter, who will all be proud to wait upon
your honour; REEVE-1777-1,6.132

let me hold your honour's stirrup whilst you alight.  REEVE-1777-1,6.133

He seconded these words by the proper action, REEVE-1777-1,6.134

and having assisted his guest to dismount, he conducted him into his
house, REEVE-1777-1,6.135

called his wife to attend him, REEVE-1777-1,6.136

and then led his horse under a poor shed, that served him as a stable.
REEVE-1777-1,6.137

Sir Philip was fatigued in body and mind, REEVE-1777-1,6.138

and was glad to repose himself any where {COM:sic}.  REEVE-1777-1,6.139

The courtesy of his host engaged his attention, REEVE-1777-1,6.140

and satisfied his wishes.  REEVE-1777-1,6.141

He soon after returned, followed by a youth of about eighteen years,
REEVE-1777-1,6.142

make haste John, said the father, and before you say neither more nor
less than what I have told you.  REEVE-1777-1,6.143

I will father, said the lad, REEVE-1777-1,6.144

and immediately set off, REEVE-1777-1,6.145

run like a buck across the fields, REEVE-1777-1,6.146

and was out of sight in an instant.  REEVE-1777-1,6.147

I hope friend, said sir Philip, you have not sent your son to provide
for my entertainment, REEVE-1777-1,6.148

I am a soldier, used <P_7> to lodge and fare hard, REEVE-1777-1,7.149

and if it were otherwise, your courtesy and kindness would give a relish
to the most ordinary food.  REEVE-1777-1,7.150

I wish heartily, said Wyatt, it was in my power to entertain your honour
as you ought to be, REEVE-1777-1,7.151

but as I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do so, I will, when my son returns
acquaint you with the errand I sent him on.  REEVE-1777-1,7.152

After this they conversed together on common subjects, like fellow
creatures of the same natural form and endowments, tho'different kinds
of education had given a conscious superiority to the one, a conscious
inferiority to the other; REEVE-1777-1,7.153

and the due respect was paid by the latter, without being exacted by
the former.  REEVE-1777-1,7.154

- In about half an hour young John returned - REEVE-1777-1,7.155

thou hast made haste, said the father; REEVE-1777-1,7.156

not more than good speed, quoth the son - REEVE-1777-1,7.157

tell us then how you sped?  REEVE-1777-1,7.158

- shall I tell all that passed, said John?  {COM:punctuation_sic}
REEVE-1777-1,7.159

- all, said the father, REEVE-1777-1,7.160

I $do $n't {TEXT:dont} want to hide any thing.  REEVE-1777-1,7.161

John stood with his cap in his hand, REEVE-1777-1,7.162

and thus told his tale.  REEVE-1777-1,7.163

- I went straight to the castle as fast as I could run, REEVE-1777-1,7.164

it was my hap to light on young master Edmund first, REEVE-1777-1,7.165

so I told him just as you bad me, that a noble gentleman was come a
long journey from foreign parts to see the lord Lovel, his friend,
and having lived abroad many years, he did not know that he was dead,
and that the castle was fallen into other hands; that upon hearing
these tidings he was much grieved and disappointed, and wanting a
night's lodging to rest himself before he returned to his own home,
he was fain to take up with one at our cottage; that my father thought
my lord would be angry with him, if he were not told of the stranger's
journey and intentions, especially to <P_8> let such a man lye at our
cottage, where he could neither be lodged nor entertained according to
his quality.  REEVE-1777-1,8.166

Here John stopped, REEVE-1777-1,8.167

and his father exclaimed, a good lad?  {COM:punctuation_sic}
REEVE-1777-1,8.168

- you did your errand very well; REEVE-1777-1,8.169

and tell us the answer - REEVE-1777-1,8.170

John proceeded - REEVE-1777-1,8.171

master Edmund ordered me some beer, REEVE-1777-1,8.172

and went to acquaint my lord of the message; REEVE-1777-1,8.173

he stayed a while, REEVE-1777-1,8.174

and then came back to me.  REEVE-1777-1,8.175

John, said he, tell the noble stranger, that the baron Fitz-Owen greets
him well, and desires him to rest assured, that though lord Lovel is dead,
and the castle fallen into other hands, his friends will always find
a welcome there; and my lord desires that he will accept of a lodging
there, while he remains in this country - REEVE-1777-1,8.176

so I come away directly, REEVE-1777-1,8.177

and made haste to deliver my errand.  REEVE-1777-1,8.178

Sir Philip expressed some dissatisfaction at this mark of old Wyatt's
respect - REEVE-1777-1,8.179

I wish, said he, that you had acquainted me with your intention before
you sent to inform the baron I was here.  REEVE-1777-1,8.180

I choose rather to lodge with you, REEVE-1777-1,8.181

and I propose to make amends for the trouble I shall give you.
REEVE-1777-1,8.182

Pray sir $do $n't {TEXT:dont} mention it, said the peasant,
REEVE-1777-1,8.183

you are as welcome as myself, REEVE-1777-1,8.184

I hope no offence; REEVE-1777-1,8.185

the only reason of my sending was, because I am both unable and unworthy
to entertain your honour.  REEVE-1777-1,8.186

- I am sorry, said sir Philip, you should think me so dainty,
REEVE-1777-1,8.187

I am a christian soldier, REEVE-1777-1,8.188

and him I acknowledge for my prince and master, accepted the invitations
of the poor, REEVE-1777-1,8.189

and washed the feet of his disciples.  REEVE-1777-1,8.190

Let us say no more on this head, REEVE-1777-1,8.191

I am resolved to stay this night in your cottage, REEVE-1777-1,8.192

tomorrow I will wait on the baron, and thank him for his hospitable
invitation.  REEVE-1777-1,8.193

- That shall <P_9> be as your honour pleases, since you will condescend
to stay here.  REEVE-1777-1,9.194

John, do you run back and acquaint my lord of it; REEVE-1777-1,9.195

not so, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,9.196

it is now almost dark, REEVE-1777-1,9.197

- $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} no matter, said John, REEVE-1777-1,9.198

I can go it blindfold.  REEVE-1777-1,9.199

Sir Philip then gave him a message to the baron in his own name,
acquainting him that he would pay his respects to him in the morning.
REEVE-1777-1,9.200

John flew back the second time, REEVE-1777-1,9.201

and soon returned with new commendations from the baron, and that he
would expect him on the morrow.  REEVE-1777-1,9.202

Sir Philip gave him an angel of gold, REEVE-1777-1,9.203

and praised his speed and abilities.  REEVE-1777-1,9.204

He supped with Wyatt and his family upon new laid eggs and rashers of
bacon, with the highest relish.  REEVE-1777-1,9.205

They praised the Creator for His gifts, REEVE-1777-1,9.206

and acknowledged they were unworthy of the least of his blessings.
REEVE-1777-1,9.207

They gave the best of their two lofts up to sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,9.208

the rest of the family slept in the other, the old woman and her
daughter in the bed, the father and his two sons upon clean straw.
REEVE-1777-1,9.209

sir Philip's bed was of a better kind, and yet as much inferior to his
usual accommodations; REEVE-1777-1,9.210

nevertheless the good knight slept as well in Wyatt's cottage, as he
could have done in a palace.  REEVE-1777-1,9.211

During his sleep, many strange and incoherent dreams arose to his
imagination.  REEVE-1777-1,9.212

He thought he received a message from his friend lord Lovel, to come to
him at the castle, that he stood at the gate and received him, that he
strove to embrace him, but could not, but that he spoke to this effect.
REEVE-1777-1,9.213

- Though I have been dead these fifteen years, I still command here,
REEVE-1777-1,9.214

and none can come here without my permission, REEVE-1777-1,9.215

know that it is I that invite, and bid <P_10> you welcome,
REEVE-1777-1,10.216

the hopes of my house rest upon you.  REEVE-1777-1,10.217

Upon this he bid sir Philip follow him, REEVE-1777-1,10.218

he led him through many rooms, till at last he sunk down,
REEVE-1777-1,10.219

and sir Philip thought he still followed him, till he came into a dark
and frightful cave, where he disappeared, REEVE-1777-1,10.220

and in his stead he beheld a compleat suit of armour stained with blood,
which belonged to his friend, REEVE-1777-1,10.221

and he thought he heard dismal groans from beneath.  REEVE-1777-1,10.222

Presently after, he thought he was hurried away by an invisible hand,
and led into a wild heath, where the people were inclosing the ground,
and making preparations for two combatants; REEVE-1777-1,10.223

the trumpet sounded, REEVE-1777-1,10.224

and a voice called out still louder, forbear!  REEVE-1777-1,10.225

- it is not permitted to be revealed till the time is ripe for the event.
REEVE-1777-1,10.226

- Wait with patience on the decrees of heaven - REEVE-1777-1,10.227

He was then transported to his own house, where going into an unfrequented
room he was again met by his friend, who was living, and in all the
bloom of youth, as when he first knew him.  REEVE-1777-1,10.228

He started at the sight, REEVE-1777-1,10.229

and awoke.  REEVE-1777-1,10.230

The sun shone upon his curtains, REEVE-1777-1,10.231

and perceiving it was day, he sat up REEVE-1777-1,10.232

and recollected where he was.  REEVE-1777-1,10.233

The images that impressed his sleeping fancy remained strongly on his
mind waking; REEVE-1777-1,10.234

but his reason strove to disperse them; REEVE-1777-1,10.235

it was natural that the story he had heard should create these ideas,
that they should wait on him in his sleep, and that every dream should
bear some relation to his deceased friend.  REEVE-1777-1,10.236

The sun dazzled his eyes, REEVE-1777-1,10.237

the birds serenaded him REEVE-1777-1,10.238

and diverted his attention, REEVE-1777-1,10.239

and a woodbine forced its way through the window, REEVE-1777-1,10.240

and regaled his sense of smelling with its fragrance.  REEVE-1777-1,10.241

- He arose, REEVE-1777-1,10.242

paid his devotions to <P_11> heaven, REEVE-1777-1,11.243

and then carefully descended the narrow stairs, REEVE-1777-1,11.244

and went out at the door of the cottage.  REEVE-1777-1,11.245

- There he saw the industrious wife and daughter of old Wyatt at their
morning work, the one milking her cow, the other feeding her poultry.
REEVE-1777-1,11.246

He asked for a draught of milk, which, with a slice of rye bread, served
to break his fast.  REEVE-1777-1,11.247

He walked about the fields alone, REEVE-1777-1,11.248

for old Wyatt and his two sons were gone out to their daily labour.
REEVE-1777-1,11.249

He was soon called back by the good woman, who told him that a servant
from the baron waited to conduct him to the castle.  REEVE-1777-1,11.250

He took leave of Wyatt's wife, telling her he would see her again before
he left the country.  REEVE-1777-1,11.251

The daughter fetched his horse, which he mounted, and set forward with the
servant, of whom he asked many questions concerning his master's family.
REEVE-1777-1,11.252

How long have you lived with the baron?  REEVE-1777-1,11.253

- Ten years.  REEVE-1777-1,11.254

- Is he a good master?  REEVE-1777-1,11.255

- Yes sir, and also a good husband and father.  REEVE-1777-1,11.256

- What family has he?  REEVE-1777-1,11.257

- Three sons and a daughter.  REEVE-1777-1,11.258

- What age are they of?  REEVE-1777-1,11.259

- the eldest son is in his seventeenth year, the second in his sixteenth ,
the others several years younger; REEVE-1777-1,11.260

but beside these my lord has several young gentlemen brought up with
his own sons, two of which are his nephews; REEVE-1777-1,11.261

he keeps in his house a learned clerk to teach them languages;
REEVE-1777-1,11.262

and as for all bodily exercises, none come near them; REEVE-1777-1,11.263

there is a fletcher to teach them the use of the cross bow; a master to
teach them to ride; another the use of the sword; REEVE-1777-1,11.264

another learns them to dance; REEVE-1777-1,11.265

and then they wrestle and run, REEVE-1777-1,11.266

and have such activity in all their motions, that it does one good to
see them; REEVE-1777-1,11.267

and my lord thinks <P_12> nothing too much to bestow on their education.
REEVE-1777-1,12.268

Truly, says sir Philip, he does the part of a good parent,
REEVE-1777-1,12.269

and I honour him greatly for it; REEVE-1777-1,12.270

but are the young gentlemen of a promising disposition?
REEVE-1777-1,12.271

- yes indeed sir, answered the servant, REEVE-1777-1,12.272

the young gentlemen, my lord's sons are hopeful youths,
REEVE-1777-1,12.273

but yet there is one who is thought to exceed them all, though he is
the son of a poor labourer.  REEVE-1777-1,12.274

- And who is he, said the knight?  {COM:punctuation_sic}
REEVE-1777-1,12.275

One Edmund Twyford, the son of a cottager in our village,
REEVE-1777-1,12.276

he is to be sure as fine a youth as ever the sun shone upon, and
of so sweet a disposition that nobody envies his good fortune.
REEVE-1777-1,12.277

- What good fortune does he enjoy?  REEVE-1777-1,12.278

- why sir about two years ago, my lord, at his sons {COM:sic} request,
took him into his own family, REEVE-1777-1,12.279

and gives him the same education as his own children; REEVE-1777-1,12.280

the young lords doat upon him, especially master William, who is about
his own age.  REEVE-1777-1,12.281

It is supposed $that {TEXT:they} he will attend the young lords when
they go to the wars, which my lord intends they shall bye and bye.
REEVE-1777-1,12.282

What you tell me, said sir Philip, increases every minute my respect
for your lord, REEVE-1777-1,12.283

he is an excellent father and master, REEVE-1777-1,12.284

he seeks out merit in obscurity, REEVE-1777-1,12.285

he distinguishes and rewards it; REEVE-1777-1,12.286

I honour him with all my heart.  REEVE-1777-1,12.287

In this manner they conversed together till they came within view of
the castle.  REEVE-1777-1,12.288

In a field near the house they saw a company of youths with cross bows
in their hands, shooting at a mark.  REEVE-1777-1,12.289

There said the servant, are our young gentlemen at their exercises.
REEVE-1777-1,12.290

Sir Philip stopped his horse to observe them, REEVE-1777-1,12.291

he heard two or three of them cry out - Edmund is the victor -
REEVE-1777-1,12.292

he wins the prize!  REEVE-1777-1,12.293

I must, said sir Philip, take a view <P_13> of this Edmund -
REEVE-1777-1,13.294

he jumped off his horse, REEVE-1777-1,13.295

gave the bridle to the servant, REEVE-1777-1,13.296

and walked into the field.  REEVE-1777-1,13.297

- The young gentlemen came up, REEVE-1777-1,13.298

and paid their respects to him, REEVE-1777-1,13.299

he apologized for intruding upon their sports, REEVE-1777-1,13.300

and asked which was the victor, upon which the youth he spoke to
beckoned to another, who immediately advanced, and made his obeisance ,
REEVE-1777-1,13.301

- as he drew near, sir Philip fixed his eyes upon him, with so much
attention, that he seemed not to observe his courtesy and address.
REEVE-1777-1,13.302

- at length he recollected himself, REEVE-1777-1,13.303

and said, What is your name young man?  REEVE-1777-1,13.304

Edmund Twyford, replied the youth, REEVE-1777-1,13.305

and I have the honour to attend upon the lord $Fitz-Owen $'s
{TEXT:Fitz-Owen's} sons.  REEVE-1777-1,13.306

- pray noble sir, said the youth who first addressed sir Philip, are
not you the stranger who is expected by my father?  REEVE-1777-1,13.307

- I am sir, answered he, REEVE-1777-1,13.308

and I go to pay my respects to him - REEVE-1777-1,13.309

will you excuse our attendance sir?  REEVE-1777-1,13.310

we have not yet finished our exercises - REEVE-1777-1,13.311

my dear youth, said sir Philip, no apology is necessary,
REEVE-1777-1,13.312

but will you favour me with your proper name, that I may know to whose
courtesy I am obliged - REEVE-1777-1,13.313

my name is William Fitz-Owen, REEVE-1777-1,13.314

that gentleman is my eldest brother, master Robert, that other my kinsman,
master Richard Wenlock - REEVE-1777-1,13.315

very well, I thank you, gentle sir, REEVE-1777-1,13.316

I beg you not to stir another step, REEVE-1777-1,13.317

your servant holds my horse, REEVE-1777-1,13.318

farewel {COM:sic} sir, said master William, REEVE-1777-1,13.319

I hope we shall have the pleasure of meeting you at dinner -
REEVE-1777-1,13.320

the youths returned to their sports, REEVE-1777-1,13.321

and sir Philip mounted his horse REEVE-1777-1,13.322

and proceeded to the castle; REEVE-1777-1,13.323

he entered it with a deep sigh, and melancholy recollections.
REEVE-1777-1,13.324

The baron received him with the utmost respect and courtesy -
REEVE-1777-1,13.325

<P_14>

he gave a brief account of the principal events that had happened in
the family of Lovel during his absence; REEVE-1777-1,14.327

- he spoke of the late lord Lovel with respect, of the present with the
affection of a brother.  REEVE-1777-1,14.328

- Sir Philip in return gave a brief recital of his own adventures abroad
, and of the disagreeable circumstances he had met with since his return
home: REEVE-1777-1,14.329

he pathetically lamented the loss of all his friends, not forgetting
that of his faithful servant on the way; saying he could be contented
to give up the world, and retire to a religious house, but that he was
withheld by the consideration, that some who depended entirely upon him,
wou'd want his presence and assistance, and beside that, he thought he
might be of service to many others.  REEVE-1777-1,14.330

The baron agreed with him in opinion, that a man was of much more service
to the world who continued in it, than one who retired from it, and gave
his fortunes to the church, whose servants did not always make the best
use of it.  REEVE-1777-1,14.331

- Sir Philip then turned the conversation, REEVE-1777-1,14.332

and congratulated the baron on his hopeful family - REEVE-1777-1,14.333

he praised their persons and address, REEVE-1777-1,14.334

and warmly applauded the care he bestowed on their education.
REEVE-1777-1,14.335

He listened with pleasure to the honest approbation of a worthy heart,
REEVE-1777-1,14.336

and enjoyed the true happiness of a parent - REEVE-1777-1,14.337

sir Philip then made further enquiry concerning Edmund, whose appearance
had struck him with an impression in his favour.  REEVE-1777-1,14.338

That boy, said the Baron, is the son of a cottager in this neighbourhood
, REEVE-1777-1,14.339

his uncommon merit and gentleness of manners, distinguishes him from
those of his own class; REEVE-1777-1,14.340

from his childhood he attracted the notice and affection <P_15> of all
that knew him, REEVE-1777-1,15.341

he was beloved everywhere but at his father's house, REEVE-1777-1,15.342

and there it should seem that his merits were his crimes;
REEVE-1777-1,15.343

for the peasant his father hated him, REEVE-1777-1,15.344

treated him severely, REEVE-1777-1,15.345

and at length threatened to turn him out of doors - REEVE-1777-1,15.346

he used to run here and there on errands for my people,
REEVE-1777-1,15.347

and at length they obliged me to take notice of him; REEVE-1777-1,15.348

my sons earnestly desired I would take him into my family,
REEVE-1777-1,15.349

I did so about two years ago, intending to make him their servant,
REEVE-1777-1,15.350

but his extraordinary genius and disposition has obliged me to look upon
him in a superior light; REEVE-1777-1,15.351

perhaps I may incur the censure of many people, by giving him so
many advantages, and treating him as the companion of my children;
REEVE-1777-1,15.352

- his merit must justify or condemn my partiality for him,
REEVE-1777-1,15.353

however, I trust that I have secured to my children a faithful servant
of the upper kind, and a useful friend to my family.  REEVE-1777-1,15.354

Sir Philip warmly applauded his generous host, REEVE-1777-1,15.355

and wished to be a sharer in his bounty to that fine youth, whose
appearance indicated all the qualities that had indeared him to his
companions.  REEVE-1777-1,15.356

At the hour of dinner the young men presented themselves before their
lord and his guest - REEVE-1777-1,15.357

sir Philip addressed himself to Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,15.358

he asked him many questions, REEVE-1777-1,15.359

and received modest and intelligent answers, REEVE-1777-1,15.360

and he grew every minute more pleased with him.  REEVE-1777-1,15.361

After dinner the youths withdrew with their tutor to persue
{COM:here_and_passim_sic} their studies - REEVE-1777-1,15.362

sir Philip sat for some time, wrapt up in meditation.  REEVE-1777-1,15.363

After some minutes, the baron asked him if he might not be favoured with
the fruits of his contemplations - REEVE-1777-1,15.364

you shall my lord, answered he, REEVE-1777-1,15.365

for you have a right to <P_16> them - REEVE-1777-1,16.366

I was thinking that when many blessings are lost, we should cherish
those that remain, and even endeavour to replace the others -
REEVE-1777-1,16.367

my lord, I have taken a strong liking to that youth whom you call Edmund
Twyford, REEVE-1777-1,16.368

- I have neither children nor relations to claim my fortune, nor share
my affections - REEVE-1777-1,16.369

your lordship has many demands upon your generosity - REEVE-1777-1,16.370

I can provide for this promising youth without doing injustice to any
one, REEVE-1777-1,16.371

will you give him to me?  REEVE-1777-1,16.372

he is a fortunate boy, said the baron, to gain your favour so soon.
REEVE-1777-1,16.373

My lord, said the knight, I will confess to you, that the first thing
that touched my heart in his favour, is a strong resemblance he bears
to a certain dear friend I once had, REEVE-1777-1,16.374

and his manner resembles him as much as his person; REEVE-1777-1,16.375

his qualities deserve that he should be placed in a higher rank,
REEVE-1777-1,16.376

I will adopt him for my son, and introduce him into the world as my
relation, if you will resign him to me, REEVE-1777-1,16.377

what say you?  REEVE-1777-1,16.378

- sir, said the baron, you have made a noble offer, REEVE-1777-1,16.379

and I am too much the young man's friend to be a hindrance to his
preferment - REEVE-1777-1,16.380

it is true that I had intended to provide for him in my own family,
REEVE-1777-1,16.381

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do it so effectually as by giving
him to you, whose generous affection being unlimited by other tyes,
may in time prefer him to a higher station as he shall deserve it -
REEVE-1777-1,16.382

I have only one condition to make, that the lad shall have his option,
REEVE-1777-1,16.383

for I would not oblige him to leave my service against his inclination.
REEVE-1777-1,16.384

- you say well, replied sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,16.385

nor would I take him upon other terms - REEVE-1777-1,16.386

agreed then, said the baron, REEVE-1777-1,16.387

let us send for Edmund hither.  REEVE-1777-1,16.388

A servant was sent to <P_17> fetch him, REEVE-1777-1,17.389

he came immediately, REEVE-1777-1,17.390

and his lord thus bespoke him - REEVE-1777-1,17.391

Edmund you own eternal obligations to this gentleman, who perceiving in
you a certain resemblance to a friend of his, and liking your behaviour,
has taken a great affection for you, insomuch that he desires to receive
you into his family - REEVE-1777-1,17.392

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} better provide for you than by disposing of
you to him, REEVE-1777-1,17.393

and if you have no objection you shall return home with him, when he
goes from hence.  REEVE-1777-1,17.394

The countenance of Edmund underwent many alterations during this proposal
of his lord, REEVE-1777-1,17.395

it expressed tenderness, gratitude, and sorrow, REEVE-1777-1,17.396

but the last was predominant, REEVE-1777-1,17.397

- he bowed respectfully to the baron and sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,17.398

and after some hesitation spoke as follows - REEVE-1777-1,17.399

I feel very strongly the obligations I owe to this gentleman, for his
noble and generous offer - REEVE-1777-1,17.400

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} express the sense I have of his goodness to me,
a peasant boy, only known to him by my lord's kind and partial mention -
REEVE-1777-1,17.401

this uncommon bounty claims my eternal gratitude.  REEVE-1777-1,17.402

To you my honoured lord, I owe every thing, even this gentleman's good
opinion - REEVE-1777-1,17.403

you distinguished me when nobody else did, REEVE-1777-1,17.404

and next to you, your sons are my best and dearest benefactors,
REEVE-1777-1,17.405

they introduced me to your notice.  REEVE-1777-1,17.406

My heart is unalterably attached to this house and family,
REEVE-1777-1,17.407

and my utmost ambition is to spend my life in your service -
REEVE-1777-1,17.408

but if you have perceived any great and grievous faults in me, that
make you wish to put me out of your family, and if you have recommended
me to this gentleman in order to be rid of me, in that case I will
submit to your pleasure as I would if you should sentence me to death.
- REEVE-1777-1,17.409

<P_18>

During this speech the tears made themselves channels down Edmund's
cheeks, REEVE-1777-1,18.411

and his two noble auditors, catching the tender infection, wiped their
eyes at the conclusion.  REEVE-1777-1,18.412

My dear child, said the baron, you overcome me by your tenderness and
gratitude - REEVE-1777-1,18.413

I know of no faults you have committed, that I should wish to be rid of
you - REEVE-1777-1,18.414

I thought to do you the best service by promoting you to that of
sir Philip Harclay, who is both able and willing to provide for you,
REEVE-1777-1,18.415

but if you prefer my service to his, I will not part with you.
REEVE-1777-1,18.416

Upon this Edmund kneeled to the baron, REEVE-1777-1,18.417

he embraced his knees - REEVE-1777-1,18.418

my dear lord, I am and will be your servant, in preference to any man
living, REEVE-1777-1,18.419

I only ask your permission to live and die in your service -
REEVE-1777-1,18.420

you see sir Philip, said the baron, how this boy engages the heart;
REEVE-1777-1,18.421

how can I part with him?  REEVE-1777-1,18.422

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} ask you any more, answered sir Philip,
REEVE-1777-1,18.423

I see it is impossible, REEVE-1777-1,18.424

but I esteem you both still higher than ever, the youth for his
gratitude, and your lordship for your noble mind and true generosity,
REEVE-1777-1,18.425

blessings attend you both!  REEVE-1777-1,18.426

Oh, sir, said Edmund, pressing the hand of sir Philip, do not think me
ungrateful to you, REEVE-1777-1,18.427

I will ever remember your goodness, and pray to heaven to reward it -
REEVE-1777-1,18.428

the name of sir Philip Harclay shall be engraven upon my heart, next to
my lord, and his family for ever.  REEVE-1777-1,18.429

Sir Philip raised the youth REEVE-1777-1,18.430

and embraced him, saying, if ever you want a friend, remember me,
REEVE-1777-1,18.431

and depend upon my protection, so long as you continue to deserve it.
REEVE-1777-1,18.432

Edmund bowed low REEVE-1777-1,18.433

and withdrew with his eyes full of tears of sensibility and gratitude.
REEVE-1777-1,18.434

- When he was gone, sir Philip said, I am thinking <P_19> that tho'
young Edmund wants not my assistance at present, he may hereafter stand
in need of my friendship.  REEVE-1777-1,19.435

I should not wonder if such rare qualities as he possesses, should one day
create envy, and raise him enemies, in which case he might come to lose
your favour, without any fault of yours or his own.  REEVE-1777-1,19.436

I am obliged to you for the warning, said the baron, REEVE-1777-1,19.437

I hope it will be unnecessary, REEVE-1777-1,19.438

but if ever I part with Edmund, you shall have the refusal of him.
REEVE-1777-1,19.439

I thank your lordship for all your civilities to me, REEVE-1777-1,19.440

I leave my best wishes with you and your hopeful family,
REEVE-1777-1,19.441

and I humbly take my leave.  REEVE-1777-1,19.442

Will you not stay one night in the castle?  said my lord,
REEVE-1777-1,19.443

you shall be as welcome a guest as ever.  REEVE-1777-1,19.444

- I acknowledge your goodness and hospitality, REEVE-1777-1,19.445

but this house fills me with melancholy recollections, REEVE-1777-1,19.446

I came hither with a heavy heart, REEVE-1777-1,19.447

and it will not be lighter while I remain here.  REEVE-1777-1,19.448

- I shall always remember your lordship with the highest respect and
esteem, REEVE-1777-1,19.449

and I pray God to preserve you, and increase your blessings!
REEVE-1777-1,19.450

After some further ceremonies, sir Philip departed, REEVE-1777-1,19.451

and returned to old Wyatt's, ruminating on the vicissitude of human
affairs, and thinking on the changes he had seen!  REEVE-1777-1,19.452

- At his return to Wyatt's cottage, he found the family assembled together
- REEVE-1777-1,19.453

he told them he would take another night's lodging there, which they
heard with great pleasure, REEVE-1777-1,19.454

for he had familiarised himself to them in the last evenings {COM:sic}
conversation, insomuch that they began to enjoy his company -
REEVE-1777-1,19.455

he told Wyatt of the misfortune he had sustained by losing his servant
on the way, REEVE-1777-1,19.456

and wished he could get one to attend him home in his place -
REEVE-1777-1,19.457

young <P_20> John looked earnestly at his father, REEVE-1777-1,20.458

he returned a look of approbation.  REEVE-1777-1,20.459

I perceive one in this company, said he, that would be proud to serve
your honour; REEVE-1777-1,20.460

but I fear he is not brought up well enough.  REEVE-1777-1,20.461

- John coloured with impatience, REEVE-1777-1,20.462

he could not forbear speaking.  REEVE-1777-1,20.463

Sir I can answer for an honest heart, a willing mind, and a light pair
of heels, REEVE-1777-1,20.464

and though I am somewhat awkward, I shall be proud to learn, to please
my noble master, if he will but try me.  REEVE-1777-1,20.465

You say well, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,20.466

I have observed your qualifications, REEVE-1777-1,20.467

and if you are desirous to serve me, I am equally pleased with you,
REEVE-1777-1,20.468

if your father has no objection I will take you - REEVE-1777-1,20.469

objection sir, said the old man!  REEVE-1777-1,20.470

it will be my pride to prefer him to such a noble gentleman.
REEVE-1777-1,20.471

I will make no terms for him, but leave it to your honour, to do for
him as he shall deserve.  REEVE-1777-1,20.472

Very well, said sir Philip, REEVE-1777-1,20.473

you shall be no loser by that, REEVE-1777-1,20.474

I will charge myself with the care of the young man.  REEVE-1777-1,20.475

The bargain was struck, REEVE-1777-1,20.476

and sir Philip purchased a horse for John of the old man.
REEVE-1777-1,20.477

The next morning they set out, REEVE-1777-1,20.478

the knight left marks of his bounty with the good couple
REEVE-1777-1,20.479

and departed laden with their blessing and prayers.  REEVE-1777-1,20.480

He stopped at the place where his good servant was buried,
REEVE-1777-1,20.481

and caused masses to be said for the repose of his soul,
REEVE-1777-1,20.482

went home by easy journeys, without meeting any thing remarkable by the
way - REEVE-1777-1,20.483

his family rejoiced at his return, REEVE-1777-1,20.484

he settled his new servant in attendance upon his person,
REEVE-1777-1,20.485

he then looked round his neighbourhood for objects of his charity -
REEVE-1777-1,20.486

when he saw merit in distress, it was his delight to raise and support
it - REEVE-1777-1,20.487

he spent his <P_21> time in the service of his Creator,
REEVE-1777-1,21.488

and glorified him in doing good to his creatures - REEVE-1777-1,21.489

he reflected frequently upon every thing that had befallen him in his
late journey to the west, REEVE-1777-1,21.490

and at his leisure took down all the particulars in writing.
REEVE-1777-1,21.491

<font> Hear {COM:sic} follows an interval of four years, as by the

this omission seems intended by the writer.  <$$font> REEVE-1777-1,21.493

<P_22>

About this time the prognosticks of sir Philip Harclay began to be
verified, that Edmund's good qualities might one day excite envy and
create him enemies - REEVE-1777-1,22.495

the sons and kinsmen of his patron began to seek occasion to find fault
with him, and to depreciate him with others - REEVE-1777-1,22.496

the baron's eldest son and heir, master Robert, had several contests
with master William, the second son upon his account.  REEVE-1777-1,22.497

This youth had a warm affection for Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,22.498

and whenever his brother and kinsmen treated him slightly, he supported
him against their malicious insinuations.  REEVE-1777-1,22.499

Mr. Richard Wenlock and John Markham were the sisters sons of
the lord Fitz-Owen, REEVE-1777-1,22.500

and there were several other more distant relations, who with them,
secretly envied Edmund's fine qualities, and strove to lessen him in
the esteem of the baron and his family - REEVE-1777-1,22.501

by degrees they excited a dislike in master Robert, that in time was
fixed into habit, and fell little short of aversion.  REEVE-1777-1,22.502

Young Wenlock's hatred was confirmed by an additional circumstance,
REEVE-1777-1,22.503

he had a growing passion for the lady Emma, the baron's only daughter,
REEVE-1777-1,22.504

and as love is eagle-eyed, he saw, or fancied he saw her cast an eye of
preference on Edmund.  REEVE-1777-1,22.505

An accidental service that she received from him, had excited her grateful
regards and attentions towards him.  REEVE-1777-1,22.506

The incessant view of his fine person and qualities, had perhaps improved
her esteem into a still softer sensation, though she was yet ignorant
of it, but thought it only the tribute due to gratitude and friendship.
REEVE-1777-1,22.507

<P_23>

One Christmas time, the baron and all his family went to visit a family
in Wales - crossing a ford, REEVE-1777-1,23.509

the horse that carried the lady Emma, who rode behind her cousin Wenlock ,
stumbled REEVE-1777-1,23.510

and fell down, REEVE-1777-1,23.511

and threw her off into the water - REEVE-1777-1,23.512

Edmund dismounted in a moment, REEVE-1777-1,23.513

and flew to her assistance - REEVE-1777-1,23.514

he took her out so quick, that the accident was not known to some part
of the company - REEVE-1777-1,23.515

from this time Wenlock strove to undermine Edmund in her esteem,
REEVE-1777-1,23.516

and she conceived herself obliged in justice and gratitude to defend him
against the malicious insinuations of his enemies - REEVE-1777-1,23.517

she one day asked Wenlock, why he in particular should endeavour to
recommend himself to her favour, by speaking against Edmund, to whom
she was under great obligations?  REEVE-1777-1,23.518

- he made but little reply, REEVE-1777-1,23.519

but the impression sunk deep into his rancorous heart -
REEVE-1777-1,23.520

every word in Edmund's behalf was like a poisoned arrow that rankled in
the wound, REEVE-1777-1,23.521

and grew every day more inflamed - REEVE-1777-1,23.522

sometimes he would pretend to extenuate Edmund's supposed faults, in
order to load him with the sin of ingratitude upon other occasions -
REEVE-1777-1,23.523

rancour works deepest in the heart that strives to conceal it,
REEVE-1777-1,23.524

and when covered by art, frequently puts on the appearance of candour;
REEVE-1777-1,23.525

by these means did Wenlock and Markham impose upon the credulity of
master Robert and their other relations, REEVE-1777-1,23.526

only master William stood proof against all their insinuations.
REEVE-1777-1,23.527

- The same autumn that Edmund completed his eighteenth year, the baron
declared his intention of sending the young men of his house to France
the following spring, to learn <P_24> the art of war, and signalize
their courage and abilities.  REEVE-1777-1,24.528

Their ill will towards Edmund was so well concealed, that his patron
had not discovered it, REEVE-1777-1,24.529

but it was whispered among the servants, who are generally close observers
of the manners of their principals.  REEVE-1777-1,24.530

Edmund was a favorite with them all, which was a strong presumption that
he deserved to be so, REEVE-1777-1,24.531

for they seldom shew much regard to dependents, or to superiour domestics
, who are generally objects of envy and dislike.  REEVE-1777-1,24.532

Edmund was courteous, but not familiar with them, REEVE-1777-1,24.533

and by this means gained their affections without soliciting them.
REEVE-1777-1,24.534

Among them was an old serving man, called Joseph Howell,
REEVE-1777-1,24.535

this man had formerly served the old Lord Lovel, and his son,
REEVE-1777-1,24.536

and when the young Lord died, and Sir Walter sold the castle to his
brother-in-law, the lord Fitz-Owen, he only of all the old servants
was left in the house, to take care of it, and to deliver it into the
possession of the new proprietor, who retained him in his service -
REEVE-1777-1,24.537

he was a man of few words but much reflection, REEVE-1777-1,24.538

without troubling himself about other peoples affairs, he went silently
and properly about his own business - more solicitous to discharge his
duty, than to recommend himself to notice, and not seeming to aspire to
any higher office than that of a serving man.  REEVE-1777-1,24.539

This old man would fix his eyes upon Edmund, whenever he could do it
without observation - REEVE-1777-1,24.540

sometimes he would sigh deeply, REEVE-1777-1,24.541

and a tear would start from his eye, which he strove to conceal from
observation - REEVE-1777-1,24.542

one day Edmund surprized him in this tender emotion, as he was wiping
his eyes with the <P_25> back of his hand.  REEVE-1777-1,25.543

- Why said he, my good friend, do you look at me so earnestly and
affectionately?  REEVE-1777-1,25.544

because I love you, master Edmund, said he, REEVE-1777-1,25.545

because I wish you well, REEVE-1777-1,25.546

I thank you kindly, answered Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,25.547

I am unable to repay your love, otherwise than by returning it, which
I do sincerely.  REEVE-1777-1,25.548

I thank you, sir, said the old man REEVE-1777-1,25.549

that is all I desire, and more than I deserve - REEVE-1777-1,25.550

do not say so, said Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,25.551

if I had any better way to thank you, I would not say so much about it ,
REEVE-1777-1,25.552

but words are all my inheritance - REEVE-1777-1,25.553

upon this he shook hands with Joseph, who withdrew hastily to conceal
his emotion, saying, God bless you master, REEVE-1777-1,25.554

and make your fortune equal to your deserts!  REEVE-1777-1,25.555

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help thinking you were born to a higher
station than what you now hold.  REEVE-1777-1,25.556

- you know to the contrary, said Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,25.557

but Joseph was gone out of sight and hearing.  REEVE-1777-1,25.558

- the notice and observation of strangers, and the affection of
individuals, together with that inward consciousness that always attends
superiour qualities, would sometimes kindle the flames of ambition in
Edmund's heart, REEVE-1777-1,25.559

but he checked them presently by reflecting upon his low birth and
dependant {COM:here_and_passim_sic} station - REEVE-1777-1,25.560

he was modest yet intrepid, gentle and courteous to all, frank and
unreserved to those that loved him, discreet and complaisant to those
who hated him, generous and compassionate to the distresses of his
fellow-creatures in general, humble but not servile to his patron and
superiors.  REEVE-1777-1,25.561

- once when he with a manly spirit justified himself against a malicious
imputation, his young lord Robert taxed him with pride and arrogance to
his kinsmen, REEVE-1777-1,25.562

<P_26>

Edmund denied the charge against him with equal spirit and modesty -
REEVE-1777-1,26.564

master Robert answered him sharply - REEVE-1777-1,26.565

how dare you contradict my cousins, REEVE-1777-1,26.566

do you mean to give them the lye?  REEVE-1777-1,26.567

not in words sir, said Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,26.568

but I will behave so as that you shall not believe them -
REEVE-1777-1,26.569

master Robert haughtily bad him be silent and know himself, and not
presume to contend with men so much his superiors in every respect -
REEVE-1777-1,26.570

these heart-burnings in some degree subsided by their preparations for
going to France.  REEVE-1777-1,26.571

Master Robert was to be presented at court before his departure,
REEVE-1777-1,26.572

and it was expected that he should be knighted.  REEVE-1777-1,26.573

The baron designed Edmund to be his esquire, REEVE-1777-1,26.574

but this was frustrated by his old enemies, who persuaded Robert
to make choice of one of his own domestics, called Thomas Hewson;
REEVE-1777-1,26.575

him did they set up as a rival to Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,26.576

and he took every occasion to affront him - REEVE-1777-1,26.577

all that master Robert gained by this step, was the contempt of those
who saw Edmund's merit, and thought it want of discernment in him not
to distinguish and reward it - REEVE-1777-1,26.578

Edmund requested of his lord that he might be master William's attendant
, REEVE-1777-1,26.579

and when, said he, my patron shall be knighted, as I make no doubt
he shall one day, he has promised that I shall be his esquire.
REEVE-1777-1,26.580

- the baron granted Edmund's request, REEVE-1777-1,26.581

and being freed from servitude to the rest, he was devoted to that
of his beloved master William, who treated him in public as his
principal domestic, but in private as his chosen friend and brother.
REEVE-1777-1,26.582

The whole cabal of his enemies consulted together in what manner they
should vent their <P_27> resentment against him, REEVE-1777-1,27.583

and it was agreed that they should treat him with indifference and
neglect, till they should arrive in France, and when there, they should
contrive to render his courage suspected, and by putting him upon some
desperate enterprize, rid themselves of him for ever.  REEVE-1777-1,27.584

About this time died the great duke of Bedford, to the irreparable loss
of the English nation - REEVE-1777-1,27.585

he was succeeded by Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, as regent of
France, of which great part had revolted to Charles the dauphin -
REEVE-1777-1,27.586

frequent actions ensued - REEVE-1777-1,27.587

cities were lost and won, and continual occasions offered to exercise the
courage and abilities of the youth of both nations.  REEVE-1777-1,27.588

The young men of baron Fitz-Owen's house were recommended particularly
to the regent's notice.  REEVE-1777-1,27.589

Master Robert was knighted, with several other young men of family,
who distinguished themselves by their spirit and activity upon every
occasion - REEVE-1777-1,27.590

the youth were daily employed in warlike exercises, and frequent actions
, REEVE-1777-1,27.591

and made their first essay in arms in such a manner as to bring into
notice all that deserved it.  REEVE-1777-1,27.592

Various arts were used by Edmund's enemies to expose him to danger,
REEVE-1777-1,27.593

but all their contrivances recoiled upon themselves, REEVE-1777-1,27.594

and brought increase of honour upon Edmund's head; REEVE-1777-1,27.595

he distinguished himself upon so many occasions that sir Robert himself
began to pay him more than ordinary regard to the infinite mortification
of his kinsmen and relations - REEVE-1777-1,27.596

they laid many schemes against him, REEVE-1777-1,27.597

but none took effect.  REEVE-1777-1,27.598

<font> From this place the characters in the manuscript are effaced by
time and moisture - REEVE-1777-1,27.599

here and there <P_28> some sentences are legible but not sufficient to
persue the thread of the story.  REEVE-1777-1,28.600

Mention is made of several actions in which the young men were engaged -
that Edmund distinguished himself by intrepidity in action, by gentleness
, humanity and modesty in the cessations - that he attracted the notice
of every person of observation, and also that he received personal
commendation from the regent.  REEVE-1777-1,28.601

<paren> The following incidents are clear enough to be transcribed,
REEVE-1777-1,28.602

but the beginning of the next succeeding pages, is obliterated;
REEVE-1777-1,28.603

however we may guess at the beginning by what remains.  <$$paren>
<$$font> REEVE-1777-1,28.604

<P_29>

As soon as the cabal met in sir Robert's tent, mr. Wenlock
thus began.  REEVE-1777-1,29.606

You see my friends that every attempt we make to humble this upstart,
turns into applause, to raise his pride still higher - REEVE-1777-1,29.607

something must be done, REEVE-1777-1,29.608

or his praise will go home before us, at our own expence,
REEVE-1777-1,29.609

and we shall seem only foils to set off his glories - REEVE-1777-1,29.610

any thing would I give to the man who should execute our vengeance
upon him.  REEVE-1777-1,29.611

Stop there cousin Wenlock, said sir Robert, REEVE-1777-1,29.612

though I think Edmund proud and vain-glorious, and would join in any
scheme to humble him and make him know himself; I will not suffer any
man to use such base methods to effect it.  REEVE-1777-1,29.613

Edmund is brave, REEVE-1777-1,29.614

and it is beneath an Englishman to revenge himself by unworthy means,
REEVE-1777-1,29.615

if any such are used I will be the first man to bring the guilty to
justice, REEVE-1777-1,29.616

and if I hear another word to this purpose, I will inform my
brother William, who will acquaint Edmund with your mean intentions.
REEVE-1777-1,29.617

Upon this the cabal drew back, REEVE-1777-1,29.618

and mr. Wenlock protested that he meant no more than to mortify
his pride, and make him know his proper station, REEVE-1777-1,29.619

soon after sir Robert withdrew, REEVE-1777-1,29.620

and they resumed their deliberations.  REEVE-1777-1,29.621

Then spoke Thomas Hewson, REEVE-1777-1,29.622

there is a party to be sent out tomorrow night, to intercept a convoy
of provisions for the relief of Rouen; REEVE-1777-1,29.623

I will provoke mr. Edmund to make one of this party,
REEVE-1777-1,29.624

and when he is engaged in the action, I and my companions will draw off,
and leave him to the enemy, who I trust will so handle him, that you
shall no more be troubled with him - REEVE-1777-1,29.625

this will do, said mr. Wenlock, REEVE-1777-1,29.626

<P_30>

but let it be kept from my two cousins and only known to ourselves,
REEVE-1777-1,30.628

if they offer to be of the party, I will persuade them off it;
REEVE-1777-1,30.629

and you Thomas, if you bring this scheme to a conclusion, may depend
upon my eternal gratitude - REEVE-1777-1,30.630

and mine, said Markham, REEVE-1777-1,30.631

and so said all.  REEVE-1777-1,30.632

The next day the affair was publickly mentioned, REEVE-1777-1,30.633

and Hewson, as he promised, provoked Edmund to the trial;
REEVE-1777-1,30.634

several young men of family offered themselves, among the rest sir Robert
and his brother William.  REEVE-1777-1,30.635

Mr. Wenlock persuaded them not to go, REEVE-1777-1,30.636

and set the danger of the enterprize in the strongest colours -
REEVE-1777-1,30.637

at last sir Robert complained of the tooth-ach, REEVE-1777-1,30.638

and was confined to his tent, REEVE-1777-1,30.639

Edmund waited on him, REEVE-1777-1,30.640

and judging by the ardor of his own courage of that of his patron,
thus bespoke him.  REEVE-1777-1,30.641

I am greatly concerned dear sir, that we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} have
your company at night, REEVE-1777-1,30.642

but as I know what you will suffer in being absent, I would beg the
favour of you to let me use your arms and device, REEVE-1777-1,30.643

and I will promise not to disgrace them.  REEVE-1777-1,30.644

No Edmund I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} consent to that, REEVE-1777-1,30.645

I thank you for your noble offer, REEVE-1777-1,30.646

and will remember it to your advantage, REEVE-1777-1,30.647

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} wear honours of another man's getting;
REEVE-1777-1,30.648

you have awakened me to a sense of my duty, REEVE-1777-1,30.649

I will go with you, and contend with you for glory, REEVE-1777-1,30.650

and William shall do the same.  REEVE-1777-1,30.651

In a few hours they were ready to set out; REEVE-1777-1,30.652

Wenlock and Markham, and their dependants found themselves engaged in
honour to go upon an enterprize they never intended, REEVE-1777-1,30.653

and set out with heavy hearts to join the party.  REEVE-1777-1,30.654

- they marched in silence in the horrors of a dark <P_31> night, and
wet roads; REEVE-1777-1,31.655

they met the convoy where they expected, REEVE-1777-1,31.656

and a sharp engagement ensued.  REEVE-1777-1,31.657

The victory was some time doubtful, REEVE-1777-1,31.658

but the moon rising on the backs of the English, gave them the advantage.
REEVE-1777-1,31.659

They saw the disposition of their enemies, REEVE-1777-1,31.660

and availed themselves of it - REEVE-1777-1,31.661

Edmund advanced the foremost of the party, REEVE-1777-1,31.662

he drew out the leader on the French side, REEVE-1777-1,31.663

he slew him.  REEVE-1777-1,31.664

Mr. William pressed forward to assist his friend, sir Robert,
to defend his brother - Wenlock and Markham from shame to stay behind.
REEVE-1777-1,31.665

Thomas Hewson and his associates drew back on their side,
REEVE-1777-1,31.666

the French perceived it REEVE-1777-1,31.667

and persued the advantage.  REEVE-1777-1,31.668

Edmund pushed them in front, REEVE-1777-1,31.669

the young nobles all followed him; REEVE-1777-1,31.670

they broke through the detachment, REEVE-1777-1,31.671

and stopped the waggons.  REEVE-1777-1,31.672

The officer who commanded the party, encouraged them to go on;
REEVE-1777-1,31.673

the defeat was soon compleat, and the provisions carried in triumph to
the English camp.  REEVE-1777-1,31.674

Edmund was presented to the regent as the man to whom the victory was
chiefly owing - REEVE-1777-1,31.675

not a tongue presumed to lift itself against him, REEVE-1777-1,31.676

even malice and envy were silenced.  REEVE-1777-1,31.677

Approach young man, said the regent, that I may confer upon you the
honour of knighthood, which you have well deserved.  REEVE-1777-1,31.678

- Mr. Wenlock could no longer forbear speaking, REEVE-1777-1,31.679

knighthood, said he, is an order belonging to gentlemen,
REEVE-1777-1,31.680

it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be conferred on a peasant - REEVE-1777-1,31.681

what say you sir, said the regent, REEVE-1777-1,31.682

is this youth a peasant?  REEVE-1777-1,31.683

he is, said Wenlock, REEVE-1777-1,31.684

let him deny it if he can.  REEVE-1777-1,31.685

Edmund with a modest bow; it is true indeed I am a peasant,
REEVE-1777-1,31.686

and <P_32> this honour is too great for me, REEVE-1777-1,32.687

I have only done my duty.  REEVE-1777-1,32.688

The duke of York whose pride of birth equalled any man living or dead,
sheathed his sword immediately.  REEVE-1777-1,32.689

Though said he, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} reward you as I intended, I
will take care that you shall have a large share in the spoils of this
night, REEVE-1777-1,32.690

and I declare publickly that you stand first in the list of gallant men
in this engagement.  REEVE-1777-1,32.691

Thomas Hewson and his associates made a poor figure in their return;
REEVE-1777-1,32.692

they were publickly reproved for their backwardness.  REEVE-1777-1,32.693

Hewson was wounded in body, and more in mind, for the ill success of
his ill laid design.  REEVE-1777-1,32.694

He could not hold up his head before Edmund, who unconscious of their
malice, administered every kind of comfort to them.  REEVE-1777-1,32.695

He spoke in their behalf to the commanding officer, imputing their
conduct to unavoidable accidents.  REEVE-1777-1,32.696

He visited them privately, REEVE-1777-1,32.697

he gave them a part of the spoils allotted to himself, REEVE-1777-1,32.698

by every act of valour and courtesy, he strove to engage those hearts
that hated, envied and maligned him, REEVE-1777-1,32.699

but where hatred arises from envy of superior qualities, every
display of those qualities increases the cause from whence it arises.
REEVE-1777-1,32.700

<font> Another pause ensues.  <$$font> REEVE-1777-1,32.701

The young nobles and gentlemen who distinguished Edmund, were prevented
from raising him to preferment by the insinuations of Wenlock and his
associates, REEVE-1777-1,32.702

he never failed to set before them his low descent, his pride and
arrogance in presuming to rank with gentlemen.  REEVE-1777-1,32.703

<P_33>

<font> Here the manuscript is not legible for a long way.
REEVE-1777-1,33.705

There is mention about this time of the death of the lady Fitz-Owen,
but not the cause.  REEVE-1777-1,33.706

Wenlock rejoiced to find that his schemes took effect that they should
be recalled at the approach of winter.  REEVE-1777-1,33.707

The baron was glad of a pretence to send for them home,
REEVE-1777-1,33.708

for he could no longer endure the absence of his children after the loss
of their mother.  REEVE-1777-1,33.709

The manuscript again defaced by moisture for many leaves,
REEVE-1777-1,33.710

<P_34>

From the time the young men returned from France, the enemies of Edmund
employed their utmost abilities to ruin him in the baron's opinion,
and get him dismissed from the family - REEVE-1777-1,34.714

they insinuated a thousand things against him that happened, as they said,
during his residence in France, and therefore could not be known to his
master; REEVE-1777-1,34.715

but when the baron privately enquired of his two elder sons, he found
there was no truth in their reports.  REEVE-1777-1,34.716

Sir Robert though he did not love him, scorned to join in untruths
against him.  REEVE-1777-1,34.717

Mr. William spoke of him with the warmth of fraternal affection -
REEVE-1777-1,34.718

the baron perceived that his kinsmen disliked Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,34.719

but his own good heart hindered him from seeing the baseness of theirs -
REEVE-1777-1,34.720

it is said that continual dropping will wear away a stone,
REEVE-1777-1,34.721

so did their incessant reports by insensible degrees produce a coolness
in his patron's behaviour towards him - REEVE-1777-1,34.722

if he behaved with manly spirit $, $it {TEXT:._is} was misconstrued into
pride and arrogance, REEVE-1777-1,34.723

his generosity was imprudence, REEVE-1777-1,34.724

his humility was hippocrisy, the better to cover his ambition -
REEVE-1777-1,34.725

Edmund bore patiently all the indignities that were thrown upon him,
REEVE-1777-1,34.726

and though he felt them severely in his bosom, yet he scorned to
justify his conduct at the expence $of {TEXT:of_of} even his enemies -
REEVE-1777-1,34.727

perhaps his gentle spirit might at length have sunk under this treatment
, REEVE-1777-1,34.728

but providence interposed in his behalf, REEVE-1777-1,34.729

and by accidental circumstances, conducted him imperceptibly towards
the crisis of his fate.  REEVE-1777-1,34.730

Father Oswald, who had been preceptor to the young men, had a strong
affection for Edmund, <P_35> from a thorough knowledge of his heart -
REEVE-1777-1,35.731

he saw through the mean artifices that were used to undermine him in
his patron's favour, REEVE-1777-1,35.732

he watched their machinations REEVE-1777-1,35.733

and strove to frustrate their designs.  REEVE-1777-1,35.734

This good man used frequently to walk out with Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,35.735

they conversed upon various subjects, REEVE-1777-1,35.736

and the youth would lament to him the unhappiness of his situation,
and the peculiar circumstances that attended him - REEVE-1777-1,35.737

the father by his wholesome advice comforted his drooping heart,
REEVE-1777-1,35.738

and $confirmed {TEXT:cenfirmed} his patience and fortitude to bear
unavoidable evils, by conscious innocence, and the assurance of a future
and eternal reward.  REEVE-1777-1,35.739

One day, as they were walking in a wood near the castle, Edmund asked
the father what meant the preparations for building, the cutting down
trees and burning of bricks.  REEVE-1777-1,35.740

- what said Oswald, have you not heard that my lord is going to build
a new apartment on the west side of the castle, REEVE-1777-1,35.741

and why said Edmund, should my lord be at that expence when there is
one on the east side that is never occupied?  REEVE-1777-1,35.742

- that apartment, said the friar, you must have observed is always shut
up; REEVE-1777-1,35.743

I have observed it often, said Edmund.  REEVE-1777-1,35.744

but I never presumed to ask any questions about it - REEVE-1777-1,35.745

you had then, said Oswald, less curiosity and more discretion than is
common at your age.  REEVE-1777-1,35.746

You have raised my curiosity, said Edmund, REEVE-1777-1,35.747

and if it be not improper I beg you to gratify it - REEVE-1777-1,35.748

we are alone, said Oswald, REEVE-1777-1,35.749

and I am so well assured of your prudence, that I will explain this
mystery in some degree to you.  REEVE-1777-1,35.750
