<P_378>

They are The {COM:sic_with_uppercase} Prophet's Mosque in the Munakhah.
BURTON2-1857-2,378.2

Abubekr's near the Ayn el Zarka.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.3

Ali's Mosque in the Zukak el Tayyar of the Munakhah.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.4

Some authors call this the"Musalla el Eed,"because the Prophet here
prayed the Festival Prayer.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.5

Omar's Mosque, near the Bab Kuba of the Munakhah, and close to the little
torrent called El Sayh.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.6

Belal's Mosque, celebrated in books; BURTON2-1857-2,378.7

I did not see it, BURTON2-1857-2,378.8

and some Madani assured me that it no longer exists.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.9

A description of one of these buildings will suffice,
BURTON2-1857-2,378.10

for they are all similar.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.11

Moahammed's Mosque in the Munakhah stands upon a spot formerly occupied,
some say, by the Jami Ghamamah.  BURTON2-1857-2,378.12

Others believe it to be founded upon the Musalla el Nabi, a place where
the Prophet recited the first Festival prayers after his arrival at El
Medinah, and used frequently to pray, and to address <P_379> those of
his followers who lived far from the Haram.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.13

It is a trim modern building of cut stone and lime in regular layers, of
parallelogrammic shape, surmounted by one large and four smaller cupolas.
BURTON2-1857-2,379.14

These are all white-washed, BURTON2-1857-2,379.15

and the principal is capped with a large crescent, or rather a trident
rising from a series of gilt globes: BURTON2-1857-2,379.16

the other domes crown the several corners.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.17

The minaret is of the usual Turkish shape, with a conical roof, and a
single gallery for the Muezzin.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.18

An Acacia tree or two on the eastern side, and behind it a wall-like
line of mud-houses, finish the coup-d'oeil; BURTON2-1857-2,379.19

the interior of this building is as simple as the exterior.
BURTON2-1857-2,379.20

And here I may remark that the Arabs have little idea of splendor, either
in their public or in their private architecture.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.21

Whatever strikes the traveller's eye in El Hejaz is always either an
importation or the work of foreign artists.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.22

This arises from the simple tastes of the people, combined, doubtless,
with their notable thriftiness.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.23

If strangers will build for them, they argue, why should they build
for themselves?  BURTON2-1857-2,379.24

Moreover, they have scant inducement to lavish money upon grand edifices.
BURTON2-1857-2,379.25

Whenever a disturbance takes place, domestic or from without, the
principal buildings are sure to suffer.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.26

And the climate is inimical to their enduring.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.27

Both ground and air at Meccah, as well as at El Medinah, are damp and
nitrous in winter, in summer dry and torrid: BURTON2-1857-2,379.28

the lime is poor; BURTON2-1857-2,379.29

palm-timber soon decays; BURTON2-1857-2,379.30

even foreign wood-work suffers, BURTON2-1857-2,379.31

and a few years suffice to level the proudest pile with the dust.
BURTON2-1857-2,379.32

The suburbs to the S. of El Medinah are a collection of walled
villages, with plantations, and gardens between.  BURTON2-1857-2,379.33

They are laid out in the form, called here as in Egypt, <P_380>
Hosh - court-yards, with single-storied buildings opening into them.
BURTON2-1857-2,380.34

These enclosures contain the cattle of the inhabitants;
BURTON2-1857-2,380.35

they have strong wooden doors, shut at night to prevent"lifting,
"BURTON2-1857-2,380.36

and are capable of being stoutly defended.  BURTON2-1857-2,380.37

The inhabitants of the suburb are for the most part Bedouin settlers
, and a race of schismatics who will be noticed in another chapter.
BURTON2-1857-2,380.38

Beyond these suburbs, to the S., as well as to the N.
and N.E. , lie gardens and extensive plantations of palm-trees.
BURTON2-1857-2,380.39

Chap. XIX.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.42

A ride to the mosque of Kuba.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.43

<$$heading>

The principal places of pious visitation in the vicinity of El Medinah,
are the Mosques of Kuba, the Cemetery El Bakia, and the martyr Hamzah's
tomb, at the foot of Mount Ohod.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.45

These the Zair is directed by all the Olema to visit, and on the holy
ground to pray Allah for a blessing upon himself, and upon his brethren
of the faith.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.46

Early one Saturday morning, I started for Kuba with a motley crowd
of devotees.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.47

Shaykh Hamid, my Muzawwir, was by my side, mounted upon an ass more
miserable than I had yet seen.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.48

The boy Mohammed had procured for me a Meccan dromedary, with splendid
trappings, a saddle with burnished metal peaks before and behind, covered
with a huge sheepskin dyed crimson, and girthed over fine saddle-bags,
whose enormous tassels hung almost to the ground.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.49

The youth himself, being too grand to ride a donkey, and unable to borrow
a horse, preferred walking.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.50

He was proud as a peacock, being habited in a style somewhat resembling
the plume of that gorgeous bird, in the coat of many colours - yellow,
red, and golden flowers, apparently sewed on a field of bright green
silk - which cost me so dear in the Haram.  BURTON2-1857-2,381.51

He was armed, as indeed all of us were, in readiness for the Bedouins ,
BURTON2-1857-2,381.52

and he anxiously awaited opportunities of discharging his pistol.
BURTON2-1857-2,381.53

Our course lay from Shaykh Hamid's house in the Munakkah, along and up
the Fiumara,"El <P_382> Sayh,"and through the Bab Kuba, a little gate
in the suburb wall, where, by the bye, my mounted companion was nearly
trampled down by a rush of half wild camels.  BURTON2-1857-2,382.54

Outside the town, in this direction, southward, is a plain of clay,
mixed with chalk, and here and there with sand, whence protrude blocks
and little ridges of basalt.  BURTON2-1857-2,382.55

As far as Kuba, and the Harrah ridge to the west, the earth is sweet
BURTON2-1857-2,382.56

and makes excellent gugglets.  BURTON2-1857-2,382.57

Immediately outside the gate I saw a kiln, where they were burning
tolerable bricks.  BURTON2-1857-2,382.58

Shortly after leaving the suburb, an Indian, who joined our party upon the
road, pointed out on the left of the way what he declared was the place
of the celebrated Khandak, or Moat, the Torres Vedras of Arabian History.
BURTON2-1857-2,382.59

Presently the Nakhil, or palm plantations, began.  BURTON2-1857-2,382.60

Nothing lovelier to the eye, weary with hot red glare, than the rich
green waving crops and cool shade - BURTON2-1857-2,382.61

for hours I could have sat and looked at it, requiring no other occupation
- the"food of vision,"as the Arabs call it, and" pure water to the
parched throat. "BURTON2-1857-2,382.62

The air was soft and balmy, BURTON2-1857-2,382.63

a perfumed breeze, strange luxury in El Hejaz, wandered amongst the date
fronds; BURTON2-1857-2,382.64

there were fresh flowers and bright foliage, in fact, at midsummer,
every beautiful feature of spring.  BURTON2-1857-2,382.65

Nothing more delightful to the ear than the warbling of the small birds ,
that sweet <P_383> familiar sound, the splashing of tiny cascades from the
wells into the wooden troughs, and the musical song of the water-wheels.
BURTON2-1857-2,383.66

Travellers - young travellers - in the East talk of the"dismal grating
,"the"mournful monotony,"and the"melancholy creaking of these dismal
machines. "BURTON2-1857-2,383.67

To the veteran wanderer their sound is delightful from association,
reminding him of green fields, cool water-courses, hospitable villagers ,
and plentiful crops.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.68

The expatriated Nubian, for instance, listens to the water-wheel with
as deep emotion as the Ranz des Vaches ever excited in the hearts of
Switzer mercenary at Naples, or"Lochaber no more,"among a regiment of
Highlanders in the West Indies.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.69

The date-trees of El Medinah merit their celebrity.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.70

Their stately columnar stems, here, seem higher than in other lands,
BURTON2-1857-2,383.71

and their lower fronds are allowed to tremble in the breeze without
mutilation.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.72

These enormous palms were loaded with ripening fruit,
BURTON2-1857-2,383.73

and the clusters, carefully tied up, must often have weighed upwards of
eighty pounds.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.74

They hung down between the lower branches by a bright yellow stem,
as thick as a man's ancle.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.75

Books enumerate 139 varieties of trees; BURTON2-1857-2,383.76

of these between sixty and seventy are well-known, BURTON2-1857-2,383.77

and each is distinguished, as usual among Arabs, by its peculiar name.
BURTON2-1857-2,383.78

The best kind is El Shelebi; BURTON2-1857-2,383.79

it is packed in skins, or in flat round boxes covered with paper,
somewhat in the manner of French prunes, and sent as presents to the
remotest parts of the Moslem world.  BURTON2-1857-2,383.80

The fruit is about <P_384> two inches long, with a small stone,
and what appeared to me a peculiar aromatic flavour and smell;
BURTON2-1857-2,384.81

it is seldom eaten by the citizens on account of the price, which varies
from two to ten piastres the pound.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.82

The tree, moreover, is rare, and said to be not so productive as the
other species.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.83

The Ajwah is eaten, but not sold, because a tradition of the Prophet
declares, that whoso breaketh his fast every day with six or seven of
the Ajwah-date need fear neither poison, nor magic.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.84

The third kind, El Hilwah, also a large date, derives a name from its
exceeding sweetness: BURTON2-1857-2,384.85

of this tree the Moslems relate that the Prophet planted a stone, which
in a few minutes grew up and bore fruit.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.86

Next comes El Birni, of which was said,"It causeth sickness to depart ,
BURTON2-1857-2,384.87

and there is no sickness in it. "BURTON2-1857-2,384.88

The Wahshi on one occasion bent its head, BURTON2-1857-2,384.89

and salamed to Mohammed as he ate its fruit, for which reason even now
its lofty tuft turns earthwards.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.90

The Sayhani is so called, because when the founder of El Islam, holding
Ali's hand, happened to pass beneath, it cried,"This is Mohammed the
Prince of Prophets, BURTON2-1857-2,384.91

and this is Ali the Prince of the Pious, and the progenitor of the
immaculate Imams. "BURTON2-1857-2,384.92

Of course the descendants of so intelligent a vegetable hold high rank
in the kingdom of palms, BURTON2-1857-2,384.93

and the vulgar were in the habit of eating the Sayhani and of throwing
the stones about the Haram.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.94

The Khuzayriyah is called so, because it preserves its green colour,
even when perfectly ripe; BURTON2-1857-2,384.95

it is dried and preserved as a curiosity.  BURTON2-1857-2,384.96

The Jebeli is that most usually eaten: BURTON2-1857-2,384.97

<P_385>

the poorest kinds are the Laun and the Hilayah, costing from 4 to 7
piastres per mudd.  BURTON2-1857-2,385.99

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that the dates of El Medinah are finer
than those of Meccah, although it be highly heretical to hold such tenet.
BURTON2-1857-2,385.100

The produce of the former city was the favorite food of the Prophet, who
invariably broke his fast with this food: a circumstance which invests
it with a certain degree of relic-sanctity.  BURTON2-1857-2,385.101

The citizens delight in speaking of dates as an Irishman does of potatoes
, with a manner of familiar fondness: BURTON2-1857-2,385.102

they eat them for medicine as well as food;"Rutab,"or wet dates, being
held to be the most saving.  BURTON2-1857-2,385.103

It is doubtless the most savoury of remedies.  BURTON2-1857-2,385.104

The fruit is prepared in a great variety of ways: BURTON2-1857-2,385.105

perhaps the most favorite dish is a broil with clarified butter, extremely
distasteful to the European palate.  BURTON2-1857-2,385.106

The date is also left upon the tree to dry, and then called"Balah:
"BURTON2-1857-2,385.107

this is eaten at dessert as the"Nukliyat"- the"quatre mendiants
"of Persia.  BURTON2-1857-2,385.108

Amongst peculiar preparations must be mentioned the Kulladat el Sham.
BURTON2-1857-2,385.109

The unripe fruit is dipped in boiling water to preserve its gamboge
color, strung upon a thick thread and hung out in the air to dry.
BURTON2-1857-2,385.110

These strings are worn all over El Hejaz as necklaces by children, who
seldom fail to munch the <P_386> ornament when not in fear of slappings
; BURTON2-1857-2,386.111

and they are sent as presents to distant countries.
BURTON2-1857-2,386.112

January and February are the time for the masculation of the palm.
BURTON2-1857-2,386.113

The"Nakhwali,"as he is called, opens the female flower,
BURTON2-1857-2,386.114

and having inserted the inverted male flowers, binds them together:
BURTON2-1857-2,386.115

this operation is performed, as in Egypt, upon each cluster.
BURTON2-1857-2,386.116

The fruit is ripe about the middle of May, BURTON2-1857-2,386.117

and the gathering of it forms the Arabs'"vendemmia. "
BURTON2-1857-2,386.118

The people make merry the more readily because their favorite fruit is
liable to a variety of accidents: BURTON2-1857-2,386.119

droughts injure the tree, BURTON2-1857-2,386.120

locusts destroy the produce, BURTON2-1857-2,386.121

and the date crop, like most productions which men are imprudent
enough to adopt singly as the staff of life, is subject to failure.
BURTON2-1857-2,386.122

One of the reasons for the excellence of Medinah dates is the quantity
of water they obtain: BURTON2-1857-2,386.123

each garden or field has its well, BURTON2-1857-2,386.124

and even in the hottest weather the Persian wheel floods the soil every
third day.  BURTON2-1857-2,386.125

It has been observed that the date-tree can live in dry and barren spots
; BURTON2-1857-2,386.126

but it loves the beds of streams and places where moisture is procurable.
BURTON2-1857-2,386.127

The palms scattered over the other parts of the plain, and depending
solely upon rain water, produce less fruit, and that too of an inferior
quality.  BURTON2-1857-2,386.128

Verdure is not usually wholesome in Arabia, BURTON2-1857-2,386.129

yet invalids leave the close atmosphere of El Medinah to seek health
under the cool shades of Kuba.  BURTON2-1857-2,386.130

The gardens are divided by what might almost be called lanes, long narrow
lines with tall reed fences on both sides.  BURTON2-1857-2,386.131

The graceful branches of the Tamarisk, pearled with manna, and
cottoned over with dew, and the broad leaves of the castor plant,
glistening in <P_387> the sun, protected us from the morning rays.
BURTON2-1857-2,387.132

The ground on both sides of the way was sunken, the earth being disposed
in heaps at the foot of the fences, an arrangement which facilitates
irrigation, by giving a fall to the water, and in some cases affords a
richer soil than the surface.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.133

This part of the Medinah plain, however, being higher than the rest,
is less subject to the disease of salt and nitre.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.134

On the way here and there the earth crumbles BURTON2-1857-2,387.135

and looks dark under the dew of morning, BURTON2-1857-2,387.136

but nowhere has it broken out into that glittering efflorescence which
notes the last stage of the attack.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.137

The fields and gardens are divided into small oblongs separated from one
another by little ridges of mould which form diminutive water-courses.
BURTON2-1857-2,387.138

Of the cereals there are luxuriant maize, wheat, and barley,
BURTON2-1857-2,387.139

but the latter two are in small quantities.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.140

Here and there patches of"Barsim,"or Egyptian clover, glitter brightly
in the sun.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.141

The principal vegetables are Badanjan <paren> Egg plant <$$paren>,
the Bamiyah <paren> a kind of esculent hibiscus, called Bhendi in
India <$$paren>, and Mulukhiyah <paren> Corchoris olitorius <$$paren>
, a mucilaginous spinage common throughout this part of the East.
BURTON2-1857-2,387.142

These three are eaten by citizens of every rank; BURTON2-1857-2,387.143

they are in fact the greens and the potatoes of Arabia.
BURTON2-1857-2,387.144

I remarked also onions and leeks in fair quantities, a few beds of carrots
and beans, some Fijl <paren> radishes <$$paren>, Lift <paren> turnips
<$$paren>, gourds, cucumbers, and similar plants.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.145

Fruit trees abound.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.146

There are five descriptions of vines, the best of which is El Sherifi , a
long white grape of a flavour somewhat resembling the produce of Tuscany.
BURTON2-1857-2,387.147

Next to it, and very similar, is El Birni.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.148

The Hejazi is a round fruit, sweet, but insipid, which is also the
reproach of the Sawadi, or black grapes.  BURTON2-1857-2,387.149

And lastly, the Raziki is a small white <P_388> fruit, with a diminutive
stone.  BURTON2-1857-2,388.150

The Nebek, or Jujube, is here a fine large tree with a dark green leaf,
roundish and polished like the olive; BURTON2-1857-2,388.151

it is armed with a short, curved, and sharp thorn, BURTON2-1857-2,388.152

and bears a pale straw-colored berry, about the size of a gooseberry,
with red streaks on the side next the sun.  BURTON2-1857-2,388.153

Little can be said in favor of the fruit, which has been compared
successively by disappointed"Lotus eaters"to a bad plum, an unripe cherry,
and an insipid apple.  BURTON2-1857-2,388.154

It is, however, a favorite with the people of El Medinah, who have
reckoned many varieties of the fruit: Hindi <paren> Indian <$$paren>,
Baladi <paren>"native"<$$paren>, Tamri <paren> date-like <$$paren> ,
&c. BURTON2-1857-2,388.155

There are a few peaches, hard like the Egyptian, and almost tasteless,
fit only for stewing, but greedily eaten in a half-ripe state, large
coarse bananas, lime trees, a few water melons, figs, and apples, but
neither apricots nor pears.  BURTON2-1857-2,388.156

There are three kinds of pomegranates: BURTON2-1857-2,388.157

the best is the Shami <paren> Syrian <$$paren>; BURTON2-1857-2,388.158

it is red outside, very sweet, BURTON2-1857-2,388.159

and costs one piastre; BURTON2-1857-2,388.160

the Turki is large, and of a white color; BURTON2-1857-2,388.161

and the Misri has a greenish rind, and a somewhat subacid and harsh
flavour: BURTON2-1857-2,388.162

the latter are sold four times as cheap as the best.
BURTON2-1857-2,388.163

I never saw in the East, except at Meccah, a finer fruit than the Shami:
BURTON2-1857-2,388.164

almost stoneless, like those of Muscat, they are delicately perfumed,
and as large as an infant's head.  BURTON2-1857-2,388.165

El Medinah is celebrated, like Taif, for its"Rubb Rumman,"a thick
pomegranate syrup, <P_389> drunk with water during the hot weather,
and esteemed cooling and wholesome.  BURTON2-1857-2,389.166

After threading our way through the gardens, an operation requiring
less time than to describe them, we saw, peeping through the groves,
Kuba's simple minaret.  BURTON2-1857-2,389.167

Then we came in sight of a confused heap of huts and dwelling-houses
, chapels and towers with trees between, and foul lanes, heaps of
rubbish, and barking dogs, - the usual material of a Hejazi village.
BURTON2-1857-2,389.168

Having dismounted, we gave our animals in charge of a dozen infant
Bedouins, the produce of the peasant gardeners, who shouted"Bakhshish
"the moment they saw us.  BURTON2-1857-2,389.169

To this they were urged by their mothers, BURTON2-1857-2,389.170

and I willingly parted with a few paras for the purpose of establishing an
intercourse with fellow-creatures so fearfully and wonderfully resembling
the tail-less baboon.  BURTON2-1857-2,389.171

Their bodies, unlike those of Egyptian children, were slim and straight
, BURTON2-1857-2,389.172

but their ribs stood out with a curious distinctness,
BURTON2-1857-2,389.173

the color of the skin was that oily lamp-black seen upon the face of a
European sweep, BURTON2-1857-2,389.174

and the elf-locks, thatching the cocoanut heads, had been stained by the
sun, wind, and rain to that reddish-brown hue which Hindu romances have
appropriated to their Rakshasas or demons.  BURTON2-1857-2,389.175

Each anatomy carried in his arms a stark-naked miniature of himself,
fierce-looking babies with faces all eyes, BURTON2-1857-2,389.176

and the strong little wretches were still able to extend the right hand
and exert their lungs with direful clamor.  BURTON2-1857-2,389.177

Their mothers were fit progenitors for such progeny: long, gaunt, with
emaciated limbs, wall-sided, high-shouldered, and straight-backed
, with pendulous bosoms, spider-like arms, and splay feet.
BURTON2-1857-2,389.178

Their long elf-locks, wrinkled faces, and high cheek-bones, their lips
darker than the epidermis, hollow <P_390> staring eyes, sparkling as
if to light up the extreme ugliness around, and voices screaming as
if in a perennial rage, invested them with all the"charms of Sycorax.
"BURTON2-1857-2,390.179

These"Houris of Zetannum"were habited in long night-gowns dyed blue to
conceal want of washing, BURTON2-1857-2,390.180

and the squalid children had about a yard of the same material wrapped
round their waist for all toilette.  BURTON2-1857-2,390.181

This is not an overdrawn portrait of the farmer race of Arabs, the most
despised by their fellow-countrymen, and the most hard-favored, morally
as well as physically, of all the breed.  BURTON2-1857-2,390.182

Before entering the Mosque of El Kuba it will be necessary to call to
mind some passages of its past history.  BURTON2-1857-2,390.183

When the Prophet's she-camel, El Kaswa, as he was approaching El Medinah
after the flight from Meccah, knelt down here, he desired his companions
to mount the animal.  BURTON2-1857-2,390.184

Abubekr and Omar did so; BURTON2-1857-2,390.185

still she sat upon the ground, BURTON2-1857-2,390.186

but when Ali obeyed the order, she arose.  BURTON2-1857-2,390.187

The Prophet bade him loose her halter, BURTON2-1857-2,390.188

for she was directed by Allah, BURTON2-1857-2,390.189

and the Mosque walls were built upon the line over which she trod.
BURTON2-1857-2,390.190

It was the first place of public prayer in El Islam.
BURTON2-1857-2,390.191

Mohammed laid the first brick, BURTON2-1857-2,390.192

and with an"Anzah"or iron-shod javelin, marked out the direction of
prayer, BURTON2-1857-2,390.193

each of his successors followed his example.  BURTON2-1857-2,390.194

According to most historians, the land belonged to Abu Ayyub <P_391>
the Ansari; for which reason the"Bayt Ayyub,"his descendants, still
perform the service of the Mosque, keep the key, and share with the
Bawwabs or porters the alms and fees here offered by the Faithful.
BURTON2-1857-2,391.195

Others declared that the ground was the property of one Linah, a woman
who was in the habit of tethering her ass there.  BURTON2-1857-2,391.196

The Prophet used to visit it every Saturday on foot,
BURTON2-1857-2,391.197

and always made a point of praying the dawn-prayer there on the 17th
Ramazan.  BURTON2-1857-2,391.198

A number of traditions testify to its dignity: BURTON2-1857-2,391.199

of these two are especially significant.  BURTON2-1857-2,391.200

The first assures all Moslems that a prayer at Kuba is equal to a Lesser
Pilgrimage at Meccah in religious efficacy; BURTON2-1857-2,391.201

and the second declares that such devotion is more acceptable to the Deity
than prostrations at the Bayt el Mukaddas <paren> Jerusalem <$$paren>.
BURTON2-1857-2,391.202

Moreover sundry miracles took place here, BURTON2-1857-2,391.203

and a verset of the Koran descended from heaven.  For which reasons
the Mosque was much respected by Omar, who, once finding it empty,
swept it himself with a broom of thorns, and expressed his wonder at
the lukewarmness of Moslem piety.  BURTON2-1857-2,391.204

It was originally a square building of very small size;
BURTON2-1857-2,391.205

Osman enlarged it in the direction of the minaret, making it sixty-six
cubits each way.  BURTON2-1857-2,391.206

It is no longer"mean and decayed"as in Burckhardt's time:
BURTON2-1857-2,391.207

the Sultan Abd el Hamid, father of Mahmud, erected a neat structure of
cut stone, whose <P_392> crenelles make it look more like a place of
defence than of prayer.  BURTON2-1857-2,392.208

It has, however, no pretensions to grandeur.  BURTON2-1857-2,392.209

The minaret is of the Turkish shape.  BURTON2-1857-2,392.210

To the south a small and narrow Riwak, or raised hypo-style, with
unpretending columns, looks out northwards upon a little open area simply
sanded over; BURTON2-1857-2,392.211

and this is the whole building.  BURTON2-1857-2,392.212

The large Mastabah or stone bench at the entrance of the Mosque, was
crowded with sitting people: BURTON2-1857-2,392.213

we therefore lost no time, after ablution and the Niyat <paren>"
the Intention"<$$paren> peculiar to this visitation, in ascending the
steps, in pulling off our slippers, and in entering the sacred building.
BURTON2-1857-2,392.214

We stood upon the Musalla el Nabi <paren> the Prophet's place of prayer
<$$paren>: BURTON2-1857-2,392.215

after Shaykh Nur and Hamid had forcibly cleared that auspicious spot of a
devout Indian, and had spread a rug upon the dirty matting, we performed a
two-bow prayer, in front of a pillar into which a diminutive marble Mihrab
or niche had been inserted by way of memento.  BURTON2-1857-2,392.216

Then came the Dua, or suplication {COM:sic}, which was as follows:
BURTON2-1857-2,392.217

"O Allah!  bless and preserve, and increase, and perpetuate, and benefit,
and be propitious to, our lord Mohammed, and to his family, and to his
companions, BURTON2-1857-2,392.218

and be thou their Preserver!  BURTON2-1857-2,392.219

O Allah!  this is the Mosque Kuba, and the place of the Prophet's prayers.
BURTON2-1857-2,392.220

O Allah!  pardon our sins, BURTON2-1857-2,392.221

and veil our faults, BURTON2-1857-2,392.222

and place not over us one who feareth not thee, and who pitieth not us ,
BURTON2-1857-2,392.223

and pardon us, and the true believers, men and women, the quick of them
and the dead; BURTON2-1857-2,392.224

for verily thou, O Lord, art the hearer, the near to us, the answerer
of our supplications. "After which we recited the Testification
and the Fatihah, and we drew our palms as usual down our faces.
BURTON2-1857-2,392.225

<P_393>

We then moved away to the south-eastern corner of the edifice,
BURTON2-1857-2,393.227

and stood before a Mihrab in the southern wall.  BURTON2-1857-2,393.228

It is called"Takat el Kashf"or"Niche of Disclosure,"by those who
believe that as the Prophet was standing undecided about the direction
of Meccah, the Archangel Gabriel removed all obstructions to his vision.
BURTON2-1857-2,393.229

There again we went through the two-bow prayer, the Supplication , the
Testification, and the Fatihah, under difficulties, BURTON2-1857-2,393.230

for people crowded us excessively.  BURTON2-1857-2,393.231

During our devotions, I vainly attempted to decypher a Cufic
inscription fixed in the wall above and on the right of the Mihrab,
BURTON2-1857-2,393.232

- my regret, however, at this failure was transitory, the character not
being of an ancient date.  BURTON2-1857-2,393.233

Then we left the Riwak, BURTON2-1857-2,393.234

and despite the morning sun which shone fiercely with a sickly heat,
we went to the open area where stands the"Mabrak el Nakah,"or the "Place
of kneeling of the she Dromedary. "BURTON2-1857-2,393.235

This, the exact spot where El Kaswa sat down, is covered with a diminutive
dome of cut stone, supported by four stone pillars: BURTON2-1857-2,393.236

the building is about eight feet high and a little less in length and
breadth.  BURTON2-1857-2,393.237

It has the appearance of being modern.  BURTON2-1857-2,393.238

On the floor, which was raised by steps above the level of the ground ,
lay, as usual, a bit of dirty matting, upon which we again went through
the ceremonies above detailed.  BURTON2-1857-2,393.239

Then issuing from the canopy into the sun, a little outside the Riwak
and close to the Mabrak, we prayed upon the"Makan el Ayat,"or the "Place
of Signs. "BURTON2-1857-2,393.240

Here was revealed to Mohammed a passage in the Koran <P_394> especially
alluding to the purity of the place and of the people of Kuba," a temple
founded in purity from its first day;"BURTON2-1857-2,394.241

and again;"there men live who love to be cleansed, BURTON2-1857-2,394.242

and verily Allah delights in the clean. "BURTON2-1857-2,394.243

The Prophet exclaimed in admiration,"O ye sons of Amr!  what have ye done
to deserve all this praise and beneficence? "when the people offered
him an explanation of their personal cleanliness which I do not care
to repeat.  BURTON2-1857-2,394.244

The temple of Kuba from that day took a fresh title - Masjid el Takwa,
or the"Mosque of Piety. "BURTON2-1857-2,394.245

Having finished our prayers and ceremonies at the Mosque of Piety
, we fought our way out through a crowd of importunate beggars,
BURTON2-1857-2,394.246

and turning a few paces to the left, halted near a small chapel adjoining
the south-west angle of the larger temple.  BURTON2-1857-2,394.247

We there stood at a grated window in the western wall,
BURTON2-1857-2,394.248

and recited a supplication looking the while most reverently at a dark
dwarf archway under which the Lady Fatimah used to sit grinding grain
in a hand mill.  BURTON2-1857-2,394.249

The Mosque in consequence bears the name of Sittna Fatimah.
BURTON2-1857-2,394.250

A surly-looking Khadim, or guardian, stood at the door demanding a dollar
in the most authoritative Arab tone - BURTON2-1857-2,394.251

we therefore did not enter.  BURTON2-1857-2,394.252

At El Medinah and at Meccah the traveller's hand must be perpetually in
his pouch: BURTON2-1857-2,394.253

no stranger in Paris or London is more surely or more severely taken in.
BURTON2-1857-2,394.254

Already I began to fear that my eighty pounds would not suffice for all
the expenses of sight-seeing, BURTON2-1857-2,394.255

and the apprehension was justified by the sequel.  BURTON2-1857-2,394.256

My only friend was the boy Mohammed, who displayed a fiery economy
that brought him into considerable disrepute with his countrymen.
BURTON2-1857-2,394.257

They saw with emotion that he was preaching parsimony to me solely
that I might have more money to spend at Meccah under his auspices.
BURTON2-1857-2,394.258

This being palpably the case, I threw all the blame of penuriousness
upon the young Machiavel's shoulders, BURTON2-1857-2,394.259

and resolved, as he had taken charge of my <P_395> finances at El Medinah,
so at Meccah to administer them myself.  BURTON2-1857-2,395.260

After praying at the window, to the great disgust of the Khadim, who
openly asserted that we were"low fellows,"we passed through some lanes
lined with beggars and Bedouin children, till we came to a third little
Mosque situated due south of the larger one.  BURTON2-1857-2,395.261

This is called the Masjid Arafat, BURTON2-1857-2,395.262

and is erected upon a mound also named Tall Arafat, because on one
occasion the Prophet, being unable to visit the Holy mountain at the
pilgrimage season, stood there, saw through the intervening space,
and in spirit performed the ceremony.  BURTON2-1857-2,395.263

Here also we looked into a window instead of opening the door with a
silver key, BURTON2-1857-2,395.264

and the mesquin appearance of all within prevented my regretting the
necessity of economy.  BURTON2-1857-2,395.265

In India or Sindh every village would have a better mosque.
BURTON2-1857-2,395.266

Our last visit was to a fourth chapel, the Masjid Ali, so termed
because the Prophet's son-in-law had a house upon this spot.
BURTON2-1857-2,395.267

After praying there - and terribly hot the little hole was!  - we
repaired to the last place of visitation at Kuba - a large deep well
called the Bir El Aris, in a garden to the west of the Mosque of Piety,
with a little oratory adjoining it.  BURTON2-1857-2,395.268

A Persian wheel was going drowsily round, BURTON2-1857-2,395.269

and the cool water fell into a tiny pool, whence it whirled and bubbled
away in childish mimicry of a river.  BURTON2-1857-2,395.270

The music sounded sweet in my ears, BURTON2-1857-2,395.271

I stubbornly refused to do any more praying - though Shaykh Hamid,
for form's sake, reiterated, with parental emphasis,"how very wrong
it was,"- and sat down, as the Prophet himself did not disdain to do,
with the resolution of enjoying on the brink of the well a few moments
of unwonted"Kayf. "BURTON2-1857-2,395.272

The heat was overpowering, though it was only nine <P_396> o'clock,
BURTON2-1857-2,396.273

the sound of the stream was soothing, BURTON2-1857-2,396.274

that water wheel was creaking a lullaby, BURTON2-1857-2,396.275

and the limes and pomegranates, gently rustling, shed voluptuous fragrance
through the morning air.  BURTON2-1857-2,396.276

I fell asleep - BURTON2-1857-2,396.277

and wondrous the contrast!  - dreamed that I was once more standing "By
the wall whereon hangeth the crucified vine,"looking upon the valley of
the Lianne, with its glaucous seas and grey skies, and banks here and
there white with snow.  BURTON2-1857-2,396.278

The Bir el Aris, so called after a Jew of El Medinah, is one which the
Prophet delighted to visit.  BURTON2-1857-2,396.279

He would sit upon its brink with his bare legs hanging over the side,
BURTON2-1857-2,396.280

and his companions used to imitate his example.  BURTON2-1857-2,396.281

This practice caused a sad disaster; BURTON2-1857-2,396.282

in the sixth year of his caliphate, Osman, according to Abulfeda and
Yakut, dropped from his finger Mohammed's seal ring, which, engraved
in three lines with"Mohammed - Apostle - <paren> of <$$paren> Allah,
"had served to seal the letters sent to neighboring kings, and had
descended to the first three successors.  BURTON2-1857-2,396.283

The precious article was not recovered after three days'search,
BURTON2-1857-2,396.284

and the well was thenceforward called Bir el Khatim - of the Seal Ring.
BURTON2-1857-2,396.285

It is also called the Bir el Taflat - of Saliva - because the Prophet
honored <P_397> it by expectoration, which, by the bye, he seems to have
done to almost all the wells in El Medinah.  BURTON2-1857-2,397.286

The effect of the operation upon the Bir el Aris, say the historians,
was to sweeten the water, which before was salt.  BURTON2-1857-2,397.287

Their testimony, however, did not prevent my detecting a pronounced
medicinal taste in the luke-warm draught drawn for me by Shaykh Hamid.
BURTON2-1857-2,397.288

In Mohammed's day the total number of wells is recorded to have been
twenty: BURTON2-1857-2,397.289

most of them have long since disappeared; BURTON2-1857-2,397.290

but there still remain seven, whose waters were drunk by the
Prophet , and which, in consequence, the Zair is directed to visit.
BURTON2-1857-2,397.291

They are known by the classical title of Saba Abar, or the seven wells ,
BURTON2-1857-2,397.292

and their names are included in this couplet,"Aris and Ghars , and Rumah
and Buzaat And Busat, with Bayruha and Ihn. " BURTON2-1857-2,397.293

<P_398>

After my sleep, which was allowed to last until a pipe or two
of Latakia had gone round the party, we remounted our animals.
BURTON2-1857-2,398.295

On the left of the village returning towards El Medinah, my companions
pointed out to me a garden, called El Madshuniyah.  BURTON2-1857-2,398.296

It contains a quarry of the yellow loam or bole-earth, called by
the Arabs Tafl, the Persians Gil i Sarshui and the Sindhians Met.
BURTON2-1857-2,398.297

It is used as soap in many parts of the East, BURTON2-1857-2,398.298

and, mixed with oil, it is supposed to cool the body, and to render the
skin fresh and supple.  BURTON2-1857-2,398.299

It is related that the Prophet cured a Bedouin of the Beni Haris
tribe of fever by washing him with a pot of Tafl dissolved in water,
BURTON2-1857-2,398.300

and hence the earth of El Medinah derived its healing fame.
BURTON2-1857-2,398.301

As far as I could learn from the Madani, this clay is no longer valued
by them, either medicinally or cosmetically; BURTON2-1857-2,398.302

the only use they could mention was its being eaten by the fair sex,
when in the peculiar state described by"chlorosis. "BURTON2-1857-2,398.303

Chap. XX.  BURTON2-1857-2,399.306

The visitation of Hamzah's tomb.  BURTON2-1857-2,399.307

<$$heading>

On the morning of Sunday, the twenty-third Zu'l Kaadah <paren> 28th
August, 1853 <$$paren>, arrived the great Caravan from El Sham or
Damascus.  BURTON2-1857-2,399.309

It is popularly called Hajj El Shami, the"Damascus pilgrimage,
"as the Egyptian Cafila is El Misri, or the Cairo pilgrimage.
BURTON2-1857-2,399.310

It is the main stream which carries off all the small currents that at
this season of general movement flow from central Asia towards the great
centre of the Islamitic world, and in 1853 amounted to about 7000 souls.
BURTON2-1857-2,399.311

It was anxiously expected by the people for several reasons.
BURTON2-1857-2,399.312

In the first place, it brought with it a new curtain for the Prophet's
Hujrah, the old one being in a tattered condition; BURTON2-1857-2,399.313

secondly, it had charge of the annual stipends and pensions of the
citizens; BURTON2-1857-2,399.314

and thirdly, many families expected members returning under its escort
to their homes.  BURTON2-1857-2,399.315

The popular anxiety was greatly increased by the disordered state of
the country round about; BURTON2-1857-2,399.316

and, moreover, the great caravan had been one day late, generally arriving
on the morning of the 22nd Zu'l Kaadah.  BURTON2-1857-2,399.317

During the night three of Shaykh Hamid's brothers, who had
entered as Muzawwirs with the Hajj, came suddenly to the house:
BURTON2-1857-2,399.318

they leaped off their camels, BURTON2-1857-2,399.319

and lost not a moment in going through the usual scene of kissing,
<P_400> embracing, and weeping bitterly for joy.  BURTON2-1857-2,400.320

I arose in the morning, BURTON2-1857-2,400.321

and looked out from the windows of the Majlis: BURTON2-1857-2,400.322

the Barr el Munakhah, from a dusty waste dotted with a few Bedouins
and hair tents, had assumed all the various shapes and the colors of
a kaleidescope.  BURTON2-1857-2,400.323

The eye was bewildered by the shifting of innumerable details, in all
parts totally different from one another, thrown confusedly together in
one small field; BURTON2-1857-2,400.324

and, however jaded with sight-seeing, it dwelt with delight upon the
vivacity, the variety, and the intense picturesqueness of the scene.
BURTON2-1857-2,400.325

In one night had sprung up a town of tents of every size, color,
and shape, - round, square and oblong, - open and closed, - from the
shawl-lined and gilt-topped pavilion of the Pacha, with all the luxurious
appurtenances of the Harem, to its neighbour the little dirty green"
rowtie"of the tobacco-seller.  BURTON2-1857-2,400.326

They were pitched in admirable order: here ranged in a long line, where
a street was required; there packed in dense masses, where thoroughfares
were unnecessary.  BURTON2-1857-2,400.327

But how describe the utter confusion in the crowding, the bustling,
and the vast variety and volume of sound?  BURTON2-1857-2,400.328

Huge white Syrian dromedaries, compared with which those of El Hejaz
appeared mere pony-camels, jingling large bells, and bearing Shugdufs
like miniature green tents, swaying and tossing upon their backs;
gorgeous Takhtrawan, or litters carried between camels or mules with
scarlet and brass trappings; Bedouins bestriding naked-backed"Daluls,
"and clinging like apes to the hairy <P_401> humps; Arnaut, Turkish
, and Kurd Irregular Cavalry, fiercer looking in their mirth than
Roman peasants in their rage; fainting Persian pilgrims, forcing their
stubborn dromedaries to kneel, or dismounted grumbling from jaded donkeys;
Kahwajis, sherbet sellers, and ambulant tobacconists crying their goods;
country-people driving flocks of sheep and goats with infinite clamor
through lines of horses fiercely snorting and rearing; towns-people
seeking their friends; returned travellers exchanging affectionate
salutes; devout Hajis jolting one another, running under the legs of
camels, and tumbling over the tents'ropes in their hurry to reach the
Haram; cannon roaring from the citadel; shopmen, water-carriers and
fruit vendors fighting over their bargains ; boys bullying heretics with
loud screams; a well-mounted party of fine old Arab Shaykhs of Hamidah
clan, preceded by their varlets, performing the Arzah or war dance, -
compared with which the Pyrenean bear's performance is grace itself, -
firing their duck-guns upwards, or blowing the powder into the calves
of those before them, brandishing their swords, leaping frantically the
while, with their bright-colored rags floating in the wind, tossing their
long spears tufted with ostrich feathers high in the air, reckless where
they fall; servants seeking their masters, and masters their tents with
vain cries of Ya Mohammed; grandees riding mules or stalking on foot,
preceded by their crowd-beaters, shouting to clear the way; - here the
loud shrieks of women and children, whose litters are bumping and rasping
against one another; - there the low moaning of some poor wretch that
is seeking a shady corner to die in: BURTON2-1857-2,401.329

- add a thick dust which blurs the outlines like a London fog, with a
flaming sun that draws sparkles of fire from the burnished weapons of
the crowd, <P_402> and the brass balls of tent and litter; and - I doubt,
gentle reader, that even the length, the jar, and the confusion of this
description is adequate to its subject, or that any"word-painting "of
mine can convey a just idea of the scene.  BURTON2-1857-2,402.330

This was the day appointed for our visiting the martyrs of Ohod.
BURTON2-1857-2,402.331

After praying the dawn-prayers as directed at the Haram, we mounted our
donkeys, BURTON2-1857-2,402.332

and, armed with pistols and knives, set out from the city.
BURTON2-1857-2,402.333

Our party was large.  BURTON2-1857-2,402.334

Saad the Devil had offered to accompany us, BURTON2-1857-2,402.335

and the bustle around kept him in the best of humours;
BURTON2-1857-2,402.336

Umar Effendi was also there, quiet-looking and humble as usual, leading
his ass to avoid the trouble of dismounting every second minute.
BURTON2-1857-2,402.337

I had the boy Mohammed and my"slave,"BURTON2-1857-2,402.338

and Shaykh Hamid was attended by half a dozen relations.
BURTON2-1857-2,402.339

To avoid the crush of the Barr el Munakhah, we made a detour westwards
, over the bridge and down the course of the torrent-bed"el Sayh.
"BURTON2-1857-2,402.340

We then passed along the southern wall of the castle,
BURTON2-1857-2,402.341

traversed its eastern outwork, BURTON2-1857-2,402.342

and issued from the Bab el Shami.  BURTON2-1857-2,402.343

During the greater part of the time we were struggling through a living
tide; BURTON2-1857-2,402.344

and among dromedaries and chargers a donkey is by no means a pleasant
monture.  BURTON2-1857-2,402.345

With some difficulty, but without any more serious accident than a fall
or two, we found ourselves in the space beyond and northward of the city.
BURTON2-1857-2,402.346

This also was covered with travellers and tents, amongst which,
on an eminence to the left of the road, rose conspicuous the bright
green pavilion of the Emir El Hajj, the commandant of the Caravan.
BURTON2-1857-2,402.347

Hard by, half <P_403> its height surrounded by a Kanat or tent wall,
stood the Syrian or Sultan's Mahmal, all glittering with green and
gilding and gold, BURTON2-1857-2,403.348

and around it were pitched the handsome habitations of the principal
officers and grandees of the pilgrimage.  BURTON2-1857-2,403.349

On the right hand lay extensive palm plantations, BURTON2-1857-2,403.350

and on the left, strewed over the plain, were signs of wells and tanks,
built to supply the Hajj with water.  BURTON2-1857-2,403.351

We pass two small buildings, - one the Kubbat El Sabak, or Dome of
Precedence, where the Prophet's warrior friends used to display their
horsemanship; the second the Makan, or burial-place of Sayyidna Zaki el
Din, one of Mohammed's multitudinous descendants.  BURTON2-1857-2,403.352

Then we fall into a plain, resembling that of Kuba, but less fertile.
BURTON2-1857-2,403.353

While we are jogging over it, a few words concerning Mount Ohod may not
be misplaced.  BURTON2-1857-2,403.354

A popular distich says,"Verily there is healing to the eye that looks
Unto Ohod and the two Harrahs near. "BURTON2-1857-2,403.355

<P_404>

And of this holy hill the Prophet declared,"Ohod is a mountain which
loves us and which we love: BURTON2-1857-2,404.357

it is upon the gate of Heaven"; BURTON2-1857-2,404.358

adding,"and Ayrf is a place which hates us and which we hate:
BURTON2-1857-2,404.359

it is upon the gate of Hell. "BURTON2-1857-2,404.360

The former sheltered Mohammed in the time of danger,
BURTON2-1857-2,404.361

therefore, on Resurrection Day it will be raised to Paradise: whereas
Jebel Ayr, its neighbour, having been so ill-judged as to refuse the
Prophet water on an occasion while he thirsted, will be cast incontinently
into Hell.  BURTON2-1857-2,404.362

Moslem divines, be it observed, ascribe to Mohammed miraculous authority
over animals, vegetables, and minerals, as well as over men, angels,
and jinns.  BURTON2-1857-2,404.363

Hence the speaking wolf, the weeping post, the oil-stone, and the love
and hate of these two mountains.  BURTON2-1857-2,404.364

It is probably one of the many remains of ancient paganism pulled
down and afterwards used to build up the edifice of El Islam.
BURTON2-1857-2,404.365

According to the old Persians, the sphere hath an active soul.
BURTON2-1857-2,404.366

Some <P_405> sects of Hindus believe"mother earth,"upon whose bosom we
little parasites crawl, to be a living being.  BURTON2-1857-2,405.367

This was a dogma also amongst the ancient Egyptians, who denoted it by
a peculiar symbol, - the globe with human legs.  BURTON2-1857-2,405.368

Hence the"Makrokosmos"of the plagiaristic Greeks, the animal on a large
scale, whose diminutive was the"Mikrokosmos"- man.  BURTON2-1857-2,405.369

"Tota natura,"repeats Malpighi,"existit in minimis. "
BURTON2-1857-2,405.370

Amongst the Romans, Tellus or Terra was a female deity, anthropomorphised
according to their syncretic system, which furnished with strange gods
their Pantheon, but forgot to append the scroll explaining the inner
sense of the symbol.  BURTON2-1857-2,405.371

And some modern philosophers, Kepler, Blackmore, and others, have
not scrupled to own their belief in a doctrine which as long as"Life
"is a mere word on man's tongue, can neither be disproved nor proved.
BURTON2-1857-2,405.372

The Mohammedans, as usual, exaggerate the dogma, BURTON2-1857-2,405.373

- a Hadis related by Abu Hurayrah casts on the day of judgment the sun
and the moon into hell fire.  BURTON2-1857-2,405.374

Jebel Ohod owes its present reputation to a cave which sheltered the
Prophet when pursued by his enemies, to certain springs of which he drank,
and especially to its being the scene of a battle celebrated in El Islam.
BURTON2-1857-2,405.375

On Saturday, the 11th Shawwal, in the 3rd year of the Hijrah <paren>
26th January A.D.  625 <$$paren> Mohammed with 700 men engaged 3000
infidels under the command of Abu Sufiyan, BURTON2-1857-2,405.376

ran great personal danger, BURTON2-1857-2,405.377

and lost his uncle Hamzah, the"Lord of Martyrs. " BURTON2-1857-2,405.378

On the topmost pinnacle, also, is the Kubbat Harun, the dome erected
over Aaron's remains.  BURTON2-1857-2,405.379

It is now, I was told, in a ruinous condition, BURTON2-1857-2,405.380

and <P_406> is placed upon the"pinnacle of seven hills"in a position
somewhat like that of certain buildings on St. Angelo in the bay
of Naples.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.381

Alluding to the toil of reaching it, the Madani quote a facetious rhyme
inscribed upon the wall by one of their number who had wasted his breath:
-"Malun ibn Malun Man talaa Kubbat Harun!  BURTON2-1857-2,406.382

"Anglice`,"The man must be a ruffian who climbs up to Aaron's Dome.
"BURTON2-1857-2,406.383

Devout Moslems visit Ohod every Thursday morning after the dawn devotions
in the Haram, BURTON2-1857-2,406.384

pray for the Shuhada of Ohod, BURTON2-1857-2,406.385

and, after going through the ceremonies, return to the Haram in time
for mid-day worship.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.386

On the 12th of Rajab, Zairs come out in large bodies from the city,
BURTON2-1857-2,406.387

encamp here for three or four days, BURTON2-1857-2,406.388

pass the time in feasting, jollity, and devotion, as usual at saints'
festivals and pilgrimages in general.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.389

After half an hour's ride we came to the Mustarah or resting place,
so called because the Prophet sat here for a few minutes on his way to
the battle of Ohod.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.390

It is a newly-built square enclosure of dwarf whitewashed walls, within
which devotees pray.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.391

On the outside fronting El Medinah is a seat like a chair of rough stones.
BURTON2-1857-2,406.392

Here I was placed by my Muzawwir, who recited an insignificant
supplication to be repeated after him.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.393

At its end with the Fatihah and accompaniments, we remounted our asses
BURTON2-1857-2,406.394

and resumed our way.  BURTON2-1857-2,406.395

Travelling onwards, we came in sight of the second Harrah or ridge.
BURTON2-1857-2,406.396

It lies to the right and left of the road, BURTON2-1857-2,406.397

and resembles lines of lava, BURTON2-1857-2,406.398

but I had not $one {TEXT:on} opportunity to examine it narrowly,
BURTON2-1857-2,406.399

Then we <P_407> reached the gardens of Ohod, which reflect in miniature
those of Kuba, BURTON2-1857-2,407.400

and presently we arrived at what explained the presence of verdure and
vegetable life, - a deep Fiumara full of loose sand and large stones
denoting an impetuous stream.  BURTON2-1857-2,407.401

It flows along the southern base of Ohod, said to be part of the Medinah
plain, BURTON2-1857-2,407.402

and collects the drainage of the high lands to the S. and S.E.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.403

The bed becomes impassable after rain, BURTON2-1857-2,407.404

and sometimes the torrents overflow the neighbouring gardens.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.405

By the direction of this Fiumara I judged that it must supply the Ghabbah
or"basin"in the hills north of the plain.  BURTON2-1857-2,407.406

Good authorities, however, informed me that a large volume of water will
not stand there, but flows down the beds that wind through the Ghauts
westward of El Medinah and falls into the sea near the harbour of Wijh.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.407

To the south of the Fiumara is a village on an eminence, containing some
large brick houses now in a ruinous state; BURTON2-1857-2,407.408

these are the villas of opulent and religious citizens who visited
the place for change of air, recreation, and worship at Hamzah's tomb.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.409

Our donkeys sank fetlock-deep in the loose sand of the torrent-bed.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.410

Then reaching the northern side and ascending a gentle slope, we found
ourselves upon the battle-field.  BURTON2-1857-2,407.411

This spot, so celebrated in the annals of El Islam, is a shelving strip
of land, close to the southern base of Mount Ohod.  BURTON2-1857-2,407.412

The army of the Infidels advanced from the Fiumara in crescent
shape , with Abu Sufiyan, the general, and his idols in the centre.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.413

It is distant about three miles from El Medinah, in a northerly direction.
BURTON2-1857-2,407.414

All the <P_408> visitor sees is hard gravelly ground, covered with little
heaps of various colored granite, red sandstone, and bits of porphyry,
to denote the different places where the martyrs fell, and were buried.
BURTON2-1857-2,408.415

Seen from this point, there is something appalling in the look of the
Holy Mountain.  BURTON2-1857-2,408.416

Its seared and jagged flanks rise like masses of iron from the plain,
BURTON2-1857-2,408.417

and the crevice into which the Moslem host retired, when the disobedience
of the archers in hastening to plunder enabled Khalid bin Walid
to fall upon Mohammed's rear, is the only break in the grim wall.
BURTON2-1857-2,408.418

Reeking with heat, its surface produces not one green shrub or stunted
tree; BURTON2-1857-2,408.419

not a bird or beast appeared upon its inhospitable sides,
BURTON2-1857-2,408.420

and the bright blue sky glaring above its bald and sullen brow, made it
look only the more repulsive.  BURTON2-1857-2,408.421

I was glad to turn my eyes away from it.  BURTON2-1857-2,408.422

To the left of the road N. of the Fiumara, and leading to the
mountains, stands Hamzah's Mosque, which, like the Haram of El Medinah ,
is a mausoleum as well as a fane.  BURTON2-1857-2,408.423

It is a small square strongly-built edifice of hewn {COM:diagram_omitted}
stone, with a dome covering the solitary hypostyle to the south, and
the usual minaret.  BURTON2-1857-2,408.424

The westward wing is a Zawiyah or oratory, frequented by the celebrated
Sufi and Saint, Mohammed el Samman, the"clarified butter-seller, "one
of whose blood, the reader will remember, stood by my side in the person
of Shaykh Hamid.  BURTON2-1857-2,408.425

On the eastern side of the building a half wing projects,
BURTON2-1857-2,408.426

and opens to the south, with a small door upon a Mustabah or stone bench
five or <P_409> six feet high, which completes the square of the edifice.
BURTON2-1857-2,409.427

On the right of the road opposite Hamzah's Mosque, is a large erection ,
now in ruins, containing a deep hole leading to a well, and huge platforms
for the accommodation of travellers, BURTON2-1857-2,409.428

and beyond, towards the mountains, are the small edifices presently to
be described.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.429

Some Turkish women were sitting veiled upon the shady platform opposite
the Martyrs'Mosque.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.430

At a little distance their husbands, and the servants holding horses
and asses, lay upon the ground, BURTON2-1857-2,409.431

and a large crowd of Bedouins, boys, girls, and old women, had gathered
around to beg, draw water, and sell dry dates.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.432

They were awaiting the guardian, who had not yet acknowledged the summons.
BURTON2-1857-2,409.433

After half an hour's vain patience, we determined to proceed with the
ceremonies.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.434

Ascending by its steps the Mastabah subtending half the eastern wall,
Shaykh Hamid placed me so as to front the tomb.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.435

There, standing in the burning sun, we repeated the following prayer:
BURTON2-1857-2,409.436

"Peace be upon thee, O our lord Hamzah!  O paternal uncle of Allah's
messenger!  O paternal uncle of Allah's Prophet!  BURTON2-1857-2,409.437

Peace be upon thee, O paternal uncle of Mustafa!  BURTON2-1857-2,409.438

Peace be upon thee, O Prince of the Martyrs!  O Prince of the Happy!
BURTON2-1857-2,409.439

Peace be upon thee, O Lion of Allah!  O Lion of his Prophet!
"BURTON2-1857-2,409.440

After which, we asked Hamzah and his companions to lend us their aid,
in obtaining for us and ours pardon, worldly prosperity, and future
happiness.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.441

Scarcely had we finished when, mounted on a high-trotting dromedary,
appeared the emissary of Mohammed Khalifah, descendant of El Abbas,
who keeps the key of the Mosque, and receives the fees and donations of
the devout.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.442

It was to be opened for the Turkish pilgrims.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.443

I waited to see the interior.  BURTON2-1857-2,409.444

The Arab drew forth from his pouch, with abundant solemnity, a bunch of
curiously made keys, BURTON2-1857-2,409.445

and sharply directed me to stand away from and out of sight <P_410>
of the door.  BURTON2-1857-2,410.446

When I obeyed, grumblingly, he began to rattle the locks, and to snap
the padlocks, opening them slowly, shaking them, and making as much
noise as possible.  BURTON2-1857-2,410.447

The reason of the precaution - it sounded like poetry if not sense -
is this.  BURTON2-1857-2,410.448

It is believed that the souls of martyrs, leaving the habitations of
their senseless clay, are fond of sitting together in spiritual converse
, BURTON2-1857-2,410.449

and profane eye must not fall upon the scene.  BURTON2-1857-2,410.450

What grand pictures these imaginative Arabs see!  BURTON2-1857-2,410.451

Conceive the majestic figures of the saints - for the soul with
Mohammedans is like the old European spirit, a something immaterial in
the shape of the body - with long grey beards, earnest faces, and solemn
eyes, reposing beneath the palms, and discussing events now buried in
the darkness of a thousand years.  BURTON2-1857-2,410.452

I would fain be hard upon this superstition, BURTON2-1857-2,410.453

but shame prevents.  BURTON2-1857-2,410.454

When in Nottingham, eggs may not be carried out after sunset;
BURTON2-1857-2,410.455

when Ireland hears Banshees, or apparitional old women, with streaming
hair, and dressed in blue mantles; when Scotland sees a shroud about a
person, showing his approaching death; when France has her loup-garous
, revenants, and poules du Vendredi Saint <paren> <font> i.
e. <$$font> hens hatched on Good Friday supposed to change
color every year <$$paren>: as long as the Holy Coat cures devotees
at Tre`ves, Madonnas wink at Rimini, San Gennaro melts at Naples, and
Addolorate and Estatiche make converts to hysteria at Rome - whilst
the Virgin manifests herself to children on the Alps, whilst Germany
sends forth Psychography, <P_411> whilst Europe, the civilised, the
enlightened, the sceptical, dotes over such puerilities as clairvoyance
and table-turning; and whilst even hard-headed America believes in"
mediums,"in"snail-telegraphs,"and"spirit-rappings,"- I must hold the men
of El Medinah to be as wise, and their superstition to be as respectable
as others.  BURTON2-1857-2,411.456

But the realities of Hamzah's Mosque have little to recommend them.
BURTON2-1857-2,411.457

The building is like that of Kuba, only smaller, BURTON2-1857-2,411.458

and the hypostyle is hung with oil lamps and ostrich eggs, the usual
paltry furniture of an Arab mausoleum.  BURTON2-1857-2,411.459

On the walls are a few modern inscriptions and framed poetry, written
in a caligraphic hand.  BURTON2-1857-2,411.460

Beneath the Riwak lies Hamzah, under a mass of black basaltic stone,
resembling that of Aden, only more porous and scoriaceous, convex at the
top, like a heap of earth, without the Kiswah, or cover of a saint's tomb,
and railed round with wooden bars.  BURTON2-1857-2,411.461

At his head, or westward, lies Abdullah bin Jaysh, a name little known to
fame, under a plain whitewashed tomb, also convex; BURTON2-1857-2,411.462

and in the courtyard is a similar pile, erected over the remains of
Shammas bin Usman, another obscure companion.  BURTON2-1857-2,411.463

We then passed through a door in the northern part of the western wall,
BURTON2-1857-2,411.464

and saw a diminutive palm plantation and a well.  After which we left
the Mosque, and I was under the"fatal necessity"of paying a dollar for
the honor of entering it.  BURTON2-1857-2,411.465

But the guardian promised that the chapters Y. S. and El
Ikhlas should be recited for my benefit - the latter <P_412> forty times
- BURTON2-1857-2,412.466

and if their efficacy be one-twentieth part of what men say it is,
the reader $can $not {TEXT:cannot} quote against me a certain popular
proverb, concerning an order of men easily parted from their money.
BURTON2-1857-2,412.467

Issuing from the Mosque, we advanced a few paces towards the mountain.
BURTON2-1857-2,412.468

On our left we passed by - at a respectful distance, for the Turkish
Hajis cried out that their women were engaged in ablution - a large
Sehrij or tank, built of cut stone with steps, and intended to detain
the overflowing waters of the torrent.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.469

The next place we prayed at was a small square, enclosed with dwarf
whitewashed walls, containing a few graves denoted by ovals of loose
stones thinly spread upon the ground.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.470

This is primitive Arab simplicity.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.471

The Bedouins still mark the places of their dead with four stones planted
at the head, the feet, and the sides; BURTON2-1857-2,412.472

in the centre the earth is either heaped up Musannam <paren> <font>
i. e. <$$font> like the hump of a camel <$$paren>, or more
generally left Musattah - level.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.473

I therefore suppose that the latter was the original shape of the
Prophet's tomb.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.474

Within the enclosure certain martyrs of the holy army were buried.
BURTON2-1857-2,412.475

After praying there, we repaired to a small building still nearer to
the foot of the mountain.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.476

It is the usual cupola springing from four square walls, not in the
best preservation.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.477

Here the Prophet prayed, BURTON2-1857-2,412.478

and it is called the Kubbat el Sanaya,"Dome of the Front Teeth, "from
the following circumstance.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.479

Five Infidels were bound by oath to slay Mohammed at the battle of Ohod
: BURTON2-1857-2,412.480

one of these, Ibn Kumayyah, threw so many stones, and with such good
will that two rings of the Prophet's helmet were driven into his cheek,
and blood poured from his brow down his mustachios, which he wiped with a
cloak to prevent the drops falling to the ground.  BURTON2-1857-2,412.481

Then Utbah bin Abi Wakkas hurled a stone at him, which, splitting
his lower lip, <P_413> knocked out one of his front teeth.
BURTON2-1857-2,413.482

On the left of the Mihrab, inserted low down in the wall, is a square
stone, upon which Shaykh Hamid showed me the impression of a tooth:
BURTON2-1857-2,413.483

he kissed it with peculiar reverence, BURTON2-1857-2,413.484

and so did I.  BURTON2-1857-2,413.485

But the boy Mohammed being by me objurgated - for I remarked in him a
jaunty demeanour combined with neglectfulness of ceremonies - saluted it
sulkily, muttering the while hints about the holiness of his birthplace
exempting him from the trouble of stooping.  BURTON2-1857-2,413.486

Already he had appeared at the Haram without his Jubbah, and with ungirt
loins, - in waistcoat and shirt sleeves.  BURTON2-1857-2,413.487

Moreover he had conducted himself indecorously by nudging Shaykh Hamid's
sides during divine service.  BURTON2-1857-2,413.488

Feeling that the youth's"moral man"was, like his physical, under
my charge, and determined to arrest a course of conduct which must
have ended in obtaining for me, the master, the reputation of a"son of
Belial,"I insisted upon his joining us in the customary two-bow prayers.
BURTON2-1857-2,413.489

And Saad the Devil taking my side of the question with his usual alacrity
when a disturbance was in prospect, the youth found it necessary to yield.
BURTON2-1857-2,413.490

After this little scene, Shaykh Hamid pointed out a sprawling inscription
blessing the companions of the Prophet.  BURTON2-1857-2,413.491

The unhappy Abubekr's name had been half effaced by some fanatic Shiah
, a circumstance which seemed to arouse all the evil in my companions'
nature, BURTON2-1857-2,413.492

and looking close at the wall I found a line of Persian verse to this
effect:"I am weary of my life <paren> Umr <$$paren>, because it bears
the name of Umar. "BURTON2-1857-2,413.493

<P_414>

We English wanderers are beginning to be shamed out of our habit of
scribbling names and nonsense in noted spots.  BURTON2-1857-2,414.495

Yet the practice is both classical and oriental.  BURTON2-1857-2,414.496

The Greeks and Persians left their marks everywhere, as Egypt shows,
BURTON2-1857-2,414.497

and the paws of the Sphinx bear scratches which, being interpreted, are
found to be the same manner of trash as that written upon the remains
of Thebes in A.D.  1853.  BURTON2-1857-2,414.498

And Easterns appear never to enter a building with a white wall without
inditing upon it platitudes in verse and prose.  BURTON2-1857-2,414.499

Influenced by these considerations, I drew forth a pencil
BURTON2-1857-2,414.500

and inscribed in the Kubbat el Sanaya, {COM:arabic_omitted}"Abdullah,
the servant of Allah. "BURTON2-1857-2,414.501

<paren> A. H. 1269.  <$$paren> BURTON2-1857-2,414.502

Issuing from the dome we turned a few paces to the left,
BURTON2-1857-2,414.503

passed northwards, BURTON2-1857-2,414.504

and thus blessed the Martyrs of Ohod: BURTON2-1857-2,414.505

"Peace be upon ye, O Martyrs!  BURTON2-1857-2,414.506

Peace be upon ye, O blessed!  ye pious!  ye pure!  who fought upon
Allah's path the good fight, who worshipped your Lord until He brought
you to certainty.  BURTON2-1857-2,414.507

Peace be upon you of whom Allah said <paren> viz. in the
Koran <$$paren>'Verily repute not them slain on God's path <paren>
<font> i. e. <$$font> warring with Infidels <$$paren>
; BURTON2-1857-2,414.508

nay, rather they are alive, BURTON2-1857-2,414.509

and there is no fear upon them, BURTON2-1857-2,414.510

nor are they sorrowful! 'BURTON2-1857-2,414.511

Peace be upon ye, O Martyrs <P_415> of Ohod!  one and all, and the mercy
of Allah and his blessings. "BURTON2-1857-2,415.512

Then again we moved a few paces forward BURTON2-1857-2,415.513

and went through a similar ceremony, supposing ourselves to be in the
cave that sheltered the Prophet.  After which, returning towards the
torrent-bed by the way we came, we stood a small distance from a cupola
called Kubbat el Masra.  BURTON2-1857-2,415.514

It resembles that of the"Front-teeth,"BURTON2-1857-2,415.515

and notes, as its name proves, the place where the gallant Hamzah fell
by the spear of Wahshi the slave.  BURTON2-1857-2,415.516

We faced towards <P_416> it BURTON2-1857-2,416.517

and finished the ceremonies of this Ziyarat by a Supplication, the
Testification, and the Fatihah.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.518

In the evening I went with my friends to the Haram.
BURTON2-1857-2,416.519

The minaret galleries were hung with lamps, BURTON2-1857-2,416.520

and the inside of the temple was illuminated.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.521

It was crowded with Hajis, amongst whom were many women, a circumstance
which struck me from its being unusual.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.522

Some pious pilgrims, who had duly paid for the privilege, were
perched upon ladders trimming wax candles of vast dimensions,
BURTON2-1857-2,416.523

others were laying up for themselves rewards in Paradise, by performing
the same office to the lamps; BURTON2-1857-2,416.524

many were going through the ceremonies of Ziyarat, BURTON2-1857-2,416.525

and not a few were sitting in different parts of the Mosque apparently
overwhelmed with emotion.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.526

The boys and the beggars were inspired with fresh energy,
BURTON2-1857-2,416.527

the Aghawat were gruffer and surlier than I had ever seen them,

and the young men about town walked and talked with a freer and an easier
demeanour than usual.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.529

My old friends the Persians - there were about 1200 of them in the Hajj
caravan - attracted my attention.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.530

The doorkeepers stopped them with curses as they were about to enter,
BURTON2-1857-2,416.531

and all claimed from each the sum of five piastres, whilst other Moslems
are allowed to enter the Mosque free.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.532

Unhappy men!  they had lost all the Shiraz swagger, BURTON2-1857-2,416.533

their mustachios drooped pitiably, BURTON2-1857-2,416.534

their eyes would not look any one in the face, BURTON2-1857-2,416.535

and not a head bore a cap stuck upon it crookedly.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.536

Whenever an"Ajami,"whatever might be his rank, stood in the way of an
Arab or a Turk, he was rudely thrust aside, with abuse muttered loud
enough to be heard by all around.  BURTON2-1857-2,416.537

All eyes followed them as they went through the ceremonies of Ziyarat,
especially as they <P_417> approached the tombs of Abubekr and Omar, -
which every man is bound to defile if he can, - and the supposed place
of Fatimah's burial.  BURTON2-1857-2,417.538

Here they stood in parties, after praying before the Prophet's window:
BURTON2-1857-2,417.539

one read from a book the pathetic tale of the Lady's life, sorrows,
and mourning death, whilst the others listened to him with breathless
attention.  BURTON2-1857-2,417.540

Sometimes their emotion was too strong to be repressed.
BURTON2-1857-2,417.541

"Ay Fatimah!  Ay Mazlumah!  Way!  way!  - O Fatimah!  O thou injured one!
Alas!  alas! "- burst involuntarily from their lips, despite the danger
of such exclamations, BURTON2-1857-2,417.542

tears trickled down their hairy cheeks, BURTON2-1857-2,417.543

and their brawny bosoms heaved with sobs.  BURTON2-1857-2,417.544

A strange sight it was to see rugged fellows, mountaineers perhaps,
or the fierce Iliyat of the plains, sometimes weeping silently like
children, sometimes shrieking like hysteric girls, and utterly careless
to conceal a grief so coarse and grisly, at the same time so true and
real, that we knew not how to behold it.  BURTON2-1857-2,417.545

Then the Satanic scowls with which they passed by or pretended to pray
at the hated Omar's tomb!  BURTON2-1857-2,417.546

With what curses their hearts are belying those mouths full of blessings!
BURTON2-1857-2,417.547

How they are internally canonising Fayruz, and praying for his eternal
happiness in the presence of the murdered man!  BURTON2-1857-2,417.548

Sticks and stones, however, and not unfrequently the knife and the
sabre, have taught them the hard lesson of disciplining their feelings ,
BURTON2-1857-2,417.549

and nothing but a furious contraction of the brow, a roll of the eye,
intensely vicious, and a twitching of the muscles about the region of
the mouth, denotes the wild storm of wrath within.  BURTON2-1857-2,417.550

They generally, too, manage to discharge some part of their passion
in words.  BURTON2-1857-2,417.551

"Hail Omar thou hog! "exclaims some fanatic Madani as he passes by the
heretic - a demand more outraging than requiring a red-hot, black-north
Protestant to bless the <P_418> Pope.  BURTON2-1857-2,418.552

"O Allah!  <font> hell <$$font> him! "meekly responds the Persian ,
changing the benediction to a curse most intelligible to, and most
delicious in, his fellows'ears.  BURTON2-1857-2,418.553

I found an evening hour in the steamy heat of the Haram equal to half
a dozen afternoons; BURTON2-1857-2,418.554

and left it resolved never to revisit it till the Hajj departed from
El Medinah.  BURTON2-1857-2,418.555

It was only prudent not to see much of the Ajamis; BURTON2-1857-2,418.556

and as I did so somewhat ostentatiously, my companions discovered that
the Hajj Abdullah, having slain many of those heretics in some war or
other, was avoiding them to escape retaliation.  BURTON2-1857-2,418.557

In proof of my generalistic qualities, the rolling down of the water
jar upon the heads of the Maghribi pilgrims in the"Golden Thread" was
quoted, BURTON2-1857-2,418.558

and all offered to fight for me a` l'outrance.  BURTON2-1857-2,418.559

I took care not to contradict the report.  BURTON2-1857-2,418.560
