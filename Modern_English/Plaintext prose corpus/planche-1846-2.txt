<font> With Tree called"King Charles's Swing,"in the centre.  <$$font>
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.6

Ormonde, Wentworth, Norris, <font> and other officers, seated at a table
under the tree, with wine before them <$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,5.7

<font> Went. <$$font> $You $'ve {TEXT:You've} passed the wine
again, Ormonde!  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.8

One would suppose the bottle was a lady, you are so remarkably shy of it.
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.9

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Wentworth, you are so far right,
that I treat wine as I do women - with the greatest respect; but taking
care that neither shall intoxicate me.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.10

<font> Enter <$$font> Hector O'Donoghue, C. PLANCHE-1846-2,5.11

<font> Nor. <$$font> $Here $'s {TEXT:Here's} Hector at last.

<font> Went. <$$font> Where the deuce do you come from?
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.13

<font> Hec. <$$font> From the county of Wicklow:
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.14

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} told you so often enough.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.15

PLANCHE-1846-2,5.18

Where have you been?  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.19

<font> Hec. <$$font> Is it where have I been?  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.20

Doing the agreeable to the Ladies of the Bedchamber and the Maids of
Honour - long life to'em.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.21

Sure $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} had six of the beauties all alone to myself
this blessed morning, more shame for you, boys; PLANCHE-1846-2,5.22

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} a disgrace to the corps.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.23

<font> Orm. <$$font> $He $'s {TEXT:He's} right -
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.24

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} right: PLANCHE-1846-2,5.25

$we $'ve {TEXT:we've} been remiss in our duties.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.26

Hector is certainly the most gallant officer amongst us.
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.27

For my part, I confess - much as I admire the sex - I am the worst
dangler after a petticoat in existence.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.28

<font> Hec. <$$font> You are, PLANCHE-1846-2,5.29

you are - PLANCHE-1846-2,5.30

you may say that: PLANCHE-1846-2,5.31

notwithstanding my brilliant example, I shall never make a lady's man
of you.  PLANCHE-1846-2,5.32

But $you $'re {TEXT:you're} a good fellow, Ormonde, and my friend;
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.33

and I m {COM:sic} yours, my boy - PLANCHE-1846-2,5.34

you may take your oath of that -"till death do us part,"as the saying is.
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.35

Oh, musha!  $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} be run through the body for you any day.
PLANCHE-1846-2,5.36

<P_6>

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Hector, I hope I shall never
need such a proof of your friendship.  <font> Nor. <$$font>
Notwithstanding which, he would not hesitate to run away with your
mistress, if you had one - and run you through the body if you ran
after him.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.38

<font> Hec. <$$font> Captain Norris, allow me politely to inform
you that you labour under a mistake, sir.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.39

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} as likely to make myself a fool for a woman as any man;
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.40

but I have the weakness of being particular upon one point,
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.41

and $that $'s {TEXT:that's} this - PLANCHE-1846-2,6.42

if even the wife, or the mistress, of any friend of mine, was to get
on the blind side of my heart, and make me the victim of my natural
susceptibility, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} my own throat that $I $'d {TEXT:I'd}
cut, for shame - and not that of the friend I had injured, like a big
blackguard as I should be.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.43

<font> Went. <$$font> Hear, hear, the Irish moralist - the reverend
Father O'Donoghue!  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.44

Gentlemen, I vote for the canonization of our holy brother!
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.45

He shall figure in the calendar as Saint Hector, the patron of husbands.
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.46

<font> Hec. <$$font> By the powers, Lieutenant Wentworth, $I
$'ll {TEXT:I'll} give you an opportunity of being sainted before me.

<font> Orm. <$$font> Hector, put up, this moment!
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.50

Are you mad?  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.51

Do you know where we are?  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.52

- in the palace: PLANCHE-1846-2,6.53

and for a harmless joke - PLANCHE-1846-2,6.54

<font> Went. <$$font> Oh, if Captain O'Donoghue wishes it, ten
minutes walk will take us clear of the royal domain.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.55

<font> Nor. <$$font> No, no - this is folly, PLANCHE-1846-2,6.56

and I am to blame more than any one.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.57

I began the attack, PLANCHE-1846-2,6.58

and if anybody fights, it must be me.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.59

<font> Orm. <$$font> But nobody shall fight upon this silly matter.
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.60

Hector, give me a proof of your friendship by offering your hand to
Wentworth, who, I am sure, never meant to offend you.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.61

<font> Hec. <$$font> If the gentleman himself will say as much?
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.62

<font> Went. <$$font> I should only speak the truth -

<font> Hec. <$$font> $There $'s {TEXT:There's} my hand, then ,
with all the pleasure in life.  <bracket> <font> They shake hands <$$font>
<$$bracket> PLANCHE-1846-2,6.64

By the mass!  though $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} an Irishman, $I $'ve {TEXT:I've}
no fancy for fighting my friends - unless $they $'re {TEXT:they're}
my enemies: PLANCHE-1846-2,6.65

and $that $'s {TEXT:that's} no bull, though it sounds like one;
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.66

for $there $'s {TEXT:there's} many a man ruined by his friends, $who $'d
{TEXT:who'd} have been never the worse for all his foes could have done
to him.  PLANCHE-1846-2,6.67

<font> Nor. <$$font> $It $'s {TEXT:It's} lucky, Ormonde, that
another of your friends was not here, PLANCHE-1846-2,6.68

we might have had more difficulty in keeping the king's peace.
PLANCHE-1846-2,6.69

<font> Orm. <$$font> You mean my Scotch kinsman, the Laird of
Killiecrankie, <P_7> of course.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.70

It would not have been his fault, certainly, if matters had taken
a quiet turn.  <font> Hec. <$$font> Particularly as I had the
honour to be of the party.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.71

$He $'d {TEXT:He'd} give his ears, I believe, to pick a quarrel with me;
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.72

and it is only because I know it vexes him that I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}
give him the opportunity.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.73

<font> Orm. <$$font> Why, how have you offended him?
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.74

<font> Hec. <$$font> I wear Brussells point PLANCHE-1846-2,7.75

and use Hungary water - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.76

scent my gloves with musk and amber, PLANCHE-1846-2,7.77

and carry a gold toothpick.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.78

What does it signify?  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.79

When you want to beat a dog $it $'s {TEXT:it's} easy to find a stick.
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.80

<font> Orm. <$$font> But why want to quarrel with you in
particular?  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.81

<font> Hec. <$$font> For the sake of contradiction - because I
$wo $n't {TEXT:won't} let him.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.82

I overpower him with civility - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.83

take all his rude speeches as compliments - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.84

and keep him in a magnificent state of inflammation, that may ultimately
end in spontaneous combustion.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.85

<font> Orm. <$$font> Have a care, Hector - PLANCHE-1846-2,7.86

he is an awkward person to jest with.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.87

He is a master of fence; PLANCHE-1846-2,7.88

and has, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} said, a particular lunge, that no man has
yet effectually parried.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.89

<font> Hec. <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} trouble him for a
specimen of it some day when $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} tired of my life.
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.90

He shall keep me for one by way of a <font> bonne bouche <$$font>.
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.91

And, talk of the devil, here he comes with his Andrea Ferrara, which
is so inseparable from his body that I believe he was born with it.
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.92

It would puzzle St. Patrick to say, whether he carries the sword or

and pledge you in return.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.104

<font> Hec. <$$font> Bravo, major!  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.105

Hear the major.  PLANCHE-1846-2,7.106

<font> Kil. <$$font> Hoolie and fairlie, Captain O'Donoghue -
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.107

or in the excess o'your cordiality you may disarrange your toilet.
PLANCHE-1846-2,7.108

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, faith, then, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} rather

and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a mighty big hole $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} make in them

PLANCHE-1846-2,8.113

<font> Kil. <$$font> $You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} pardon me, sir,

The number and issue of my encounters are matters o'history.
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.123

I will not say unfortunately, PLANCHE-1846-2,8.124

for my opinions upon the subject of duelling are equally well known.
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.125

I consider the duello, or personal combat <font> a l'outrance
<$$font>, one of the grandest institutions of civilized society.
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.126

Two gentlemen are fairly brought face to face, weapon to weapon.
The sun and wind equally divided, no secret armour allowed, no undue
advantage permitted.  PLANCHE-1846-2,8.127

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} nae risk o'a random shot, or a chance blow
from some mercenary soldier, which i'the confusion o'battle has cut
short the career o'many a gallant officer - PLANCHE-1846-2,8.128

a'depends upon your ain courage, your ain skill; PLANCHE-1846-2,8.129

you attack, defend, according to established rules, PLANCHE-1846-2,8.130

and kill your antagonist PLANCHE-1846-2,8.131

or fall $yourself {TEXT:yoursel}, like a man of honour and gude breeding.

<font> Went. <$$font> $It $'s {TEXT:It's} a pity, laird, that
you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} convert his majesty to your opinion.
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.133

His objection to duelling renders an appeal to arms almost as fatal to
the victors as the vanquished.  <font> Orm. <$$font> And the
loss of one's right hand a certainty, if but a blow be struck within
the precincts of the palace.  PLANCHE-1846-2,8.134

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, $we $'ve {TEXT:we've} fallen upon
degenerate days, PLANCHE-1846-2,8.135

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} the truth of it: PLANCHE-1846-2,8.136

$there $'s {TEXT:there's} no spirit, no fight in us!  <font> Nor.
<$$font> For which reason you had all but crossed swords with Wentworth,
on this spot, a few minutes ago, for a mere jest.  PLANCHE-1846-2,8.137

<font> Kil. <$$font> Ah, indeed!  PLANCHE-1846-2,8.138

Well, well, PLANCHE-1846-2,8.139

but see you me now, gentlemen, PLANCHE-1846-2,8.140

if the affair is not settled, perhaps a meeting might yet be arranged,
that - PLANCHE-1846-2,8.141

<font> Orm. <$$font> But it is settled - quite settled:
PLANCHE-1846-2,8.142

they have shaken hands, PLANCHE-1846-2,8.143

no offence was intended.  PLANCHE-1846-2,8.144

<font> Hec. <$$font> Yes, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} a little too

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, the ladies, by all means; and

for she spoke of it as a matter arranged, and immediately to take place.
PLANCHE-1846-2,10.206

<font> Ara. <$$font> Oh, Lucy, what will become of me?
PLANCHE-1846-2,10.207

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Become of you, child!  PLANCHE-1846-2,10.208

Why, you will be Duchess of Villa Hermosa, and wife of one of the greatest
grandees of the court of Spain.  PLANCHE-1846-2,10.209

$You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} ride in a carriage drawn by eight mules,
and see your husband wear his hat in presence of his sovereign.
PLANCHE-1846-2,10.210

<font> Ara. <$$font> It will kill me, Lucy, this hated marriage;
and ah!  not only me - PLANCHE-1846-2,10.211

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Not only you?  PLANCHE-1846-2,10.212

Oh, there is a third party concerned - eh?  PLANCHE-1846-2,10.213

I fancied as much.  PLANCHE-1846-2,10.214

And who is he, pray?  PLANCHE-1846-2,10.215

You are dying to tell me, I see; PLANCHE-1846-2,10.216

and therefore there can be no impertinence in asking the question.
PLANCHE-1846-2,10.217

<font> Ara. <$$font> I confess, my dear Lucy, that I require the
advice and assistance of a true friend; PLANCHE-1846-2,10.218

and such I know you $are {TEXT:ar} <P_11> notwithstanding the levity with
which you appear to treat a circumstance so fraught with misery to me,
and - PLANCHE-1846-2,11.219

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> And - PLANCHE-1846-2,11.220

<font> Ara. <$$font> I tremble to name him; PLANCHE-1846-2,11.221

but you shall - you must - know all.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.222

Four months ago, sitting in an arbour, in the gardens yonder, with
Signora Maria, the young Italian lady who came over with the queen -
<font> Lucy.  <$$font> And has just taken the veil in the convent of
Saint Paul at Milan.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.223

I know.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.224

<font> Ara. <$$font> We were talking of her intended profession.
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.225

She was expatiating on the happiness of becoming the"bride of heaven,
"as she termed it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.226

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> And you naturally recorded your opinion in favor
of an earthly bridegroom to begin with.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.227

<font> Ara. <$$font> I acknowledged that I entertained a
secret affection for a gentleman in the service of his majesty;
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.228

and, by the most unfortunate accident, my confession was overheard.
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.229

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> By some stranger?  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.230

<font> Ara. <$$font> Alas, no!  by the gentleman himself.
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.231

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Unfortunate!  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.232

why, my dear, no accident could be more fortunate.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.233

It saved a world of trouble to both of you - that is, if the gentleman
was as much smitten as yourself.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.234

<font> Ara. <$$font> Oh, of his love I am certain.
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.235

That very evening he wrote to acknowledge his fault, request my pardon,
and assure me of his eternal devotion.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.236

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> That evening!  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.237

- what!  - did the fellow wait till the evening?  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.238

did he not, on the instant, fall at your feet, in a convulsion of
happiness and gratitude.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.239

<font> Ara. <$$font> Oh, no!  he acted with more delicacy and
discretion.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.240

He knew the necessity of secrecy - the obstacles to be surmounted;
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.241

and therefore requested but to be allowed to adore me in silence -
to continue to hope: {COM:sic} PLANCHE-1846-2,11.242

and, in order to prevent even a suspicion of our mutual affection, he
proposed that we should avoid meeting each other as much as possible
- and, when we could not avoid it, meet as utter strangers, without
exchanging even a glance which might betray us {TEXT:missing_period}
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.243

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> And do you mean to say that you have never
once met him alone - that he has never obtained a private interview?
PLANCHE-1846-2,11.244

<font> Ara. <$$font> Never.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.245

He writes to me daily - PLANCHE-1846-2,11.246

contrives by some mysterious agency to convey to me the most passionate,
and at the same time the most respectful letters; PLANCHE-1846-2,11.247

but if we meet by accident, in the palace or the gardens, he either
passes me quickly without a look, PLANCHE-1846-2,11.248

or turns suddenly round PLANCHE-1846-2,11.249

and disappears as soon as possible.  PLANCHE-1846-2,11.250

<P_12>

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Well, that is being rather more delicate
and discreet than I should think agreeable under the circumstances;
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.252

but you were always an oddity, my dear, PLANCHE-1846-2,12.253

and the young gentleman seems an admirable match for you, as far as
singularity goes.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.254

What did you say his name was?  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.255

<font> Ara. <$$font> I have never yet named him to you, Lucy.
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.256

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> But you did to the signora.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.257

Are you going to treat me with less confidence?  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.258

<font> Ara. <$$font> No; for it is necessary you should be fully
acquainted with my position; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.259

how else could you aid me?  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.260

The person in question is Henry Ormonde.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.261

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Ormonde!  - the shy, handsome lieutenant in the
Life Guards.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.262

Upon my word, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a lucky fellow to have entrapped your
confession; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.263

for $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sure $he $'d {TEXT:he'd} never have had courage
to declare himself: PLANCHE-1846-2,12.264

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} fancy his delicacy and discretion so exceedingly
personal, my love; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.265

for he runs away from petticoats in general, as if they had all got the
remains of the great plague; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.266

and looks as red, if spoken to by a woman, as if he were gazing on Paul's
church during the great fire!  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.267

And so he writes to you daily, does he?  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.268

And, pray, what would be the consequence if any portion of your
correspondence fell into the hands of the queen.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.269

<font> Ara. <$$font> Ruin, my dear - utter ruin - if they could
be traced to either of us.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.270

But his letters are never signed; PLANCHE-1846-2,12.271

and I have written but one to him, PLANCHE-1846-2,12.272

and that one contained but two words - <font> Patience <$$font>
and <font> Hope <$$font> - without either signature or direction.
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.273

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> The sweetest words that ever lover starved upon ;
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.274

and now, in two other words, equally clear and easy to remember, tell
me how I can serve you?  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.275

<font> Ara. <$$font> Read that note, PLANCHE-1846-2,12.276

and tell me what I shall do.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.277

To-night, as the clock strikes eleven, I will be in Queen Mary's Bower.
PLANCHE-1846-2,12.280

If you come not I shall deem all hope is over, PLANCHE-1846-2,12.281

Humph.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.283

<font> Ara. <$$font> Well, Lucy.  PLANCHE-1846-2,12.284

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Well, my dear, you must go: not that I think the

at that hour.  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.289

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> You shall not be alone: PLANCHE-1846-2,13.290

I will go with you.  <font> Ara <$$font> And risk the displeasure
of the queen - the chance of compromising your own reputation.
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.291

No, Lucy, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} accept this too generous offer.
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.292

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> You must: PLANCHE-1846-2,13.293

you have placed your case in my hands, PLANCHE-1846-2,13.294

and have no discretionary power.  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.295

Come, PLANCHE-1846-2,13.296

it is nearly dusk already, and time for us to enter the Palace.
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.297

We are neither of us in attendance this evening, PLANCHE-1846-2,13.298

and may therefore steal out unnoticed.  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.299

<font> Ara. <$$font> Stay, PLANCHE-1846-2,13.300

who is that yonder?  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.301

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Oh!  Captain O'Donoghue - a devoted admirer of
mine - and of forty others, I have no doubt; an agreeable, rattling
young Irishman, who has got a heart, I verily believe - somewhere;
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.302

but he is always losing, or rather mislaying it: PLANCHE-1846-2,13.303

so perhaps $it $'s {TEXT:it's} not worth keeping - certainly not
exchanging one's own for.  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.304

<font> Ara. <$$font> Has he requested the exchange, Lucy?
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.305

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Oh, half a dozen times.  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.306

He had the impudence this morning to run away with one of my gloves,
PLANCHE-1846-2,13.307

and vowed, before I know not how many people, he would never give it me
back, till I promised him the hand it belonged to.  PLANCHE-1846-2,13.308

<font> Ara. <$$font> And but for the people you would have

it was perfectly unavoidable.  PLANCHE-1846-2,14.344

<font> Orm. <$$font> Pardon me, major - PLANCHE-1846-2,14.345

it was not unavoidable.  PLANCHE-1846-2,14.346

He was evidently flushed with wine; PLANCHE-1846-2,14.347

and, but for your interference the matter might have passed without
notice.  PLANCHE-1846-2,14.348

<font> Kil. <$$font> Without notice!  PLANCHE-1846-2,14.349

A fellow like that take precedence of an officer of His Majesty's Life
Guards, PLANCHE-1846-2,14.350

and you are to pass it without notice!  PLANCHE-1846-2,14.351

Lieutenant Ormonde, I promised your deceased father - my dear friend
and brother-officer - that I would watch over the honour o'his son,
PLANCHE-1846-2,14.352

and when that honour is implicated - PLANCHE-1846-2,14.353

<font> Orm. <$$font> Honour!  PLANCHE-1846-2,14.354

- what honour is to be gained by a quarrel with such a man as Barnwell
, a dissipated hanger-on of Sunderland's - a reputed spy - but just
enough of a gentleman by birth to prevent my refusing to meet him.
PLANCHE-1846-2,14.355

As for my life, heaven knows, were I about to risk it in the field of
battle - or in a conflict with any worthy adversary, in a good <P_15>
cause - it would give me little uneasiness.  PLANCHE-1846-2,15.356

Were it now the Duke of Villa Hermosa - PLANCHE-1846-2,15.357

The duke - PLANCHE-1846-2,15.360

but nae matter.  PLANCHE-1846-2,15.361

If he have offended you, my dear friend, I shall be proud to wait on
him in your name, PLANCHE-1846-2,15.362

Although of the younger branch, your family is one o'the best in England
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.363

and he $can $na'{TEXT:canna'} refuse.  PLANCHE-1846-2,15.364

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear major, I never saw the duke in my
life, PLANCHE-1846-2,15.365

and he, most probably, is not aware even of my existence.
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.366

He is, therefore, perfectly innocent of any offence to me.
PLANCHE-1846-2,15.367

<font> Kil. <$$font> Then wherefore single him out, wi'such
remarkable expression?  PLANCHE-1846-2,15.368

<font> Orm. <$$font> No matter, PLANCHE-1846-2,15.369

that is my secret; PLANCHE-1846-2,15.370

and if Barnwell is sober enough by six o'clock to-morrow morning to kill
me, that secret will die with me.  PLANCHE-1846-2,15.371

You have settled the place, I presume, as well as the time?

PLANCHE-1846-2,16.414

<bracket> <font> in a whisper.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Arabella, my angel!
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.415

<bracket> <font> She starts and retires a little <$$font> - <font>
aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Och, St. Patrick forgive me;
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.416

but $it $'s {TEXT:it's} that confounded brogue that will ruin me, if I
$can $n't {TEXT:can't} smother it entirely.  PLANCHE-1846-2,16.417

<font> Ara. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
There is a freedom in his $manner {TEXT:maner}.  PLANCHE-1846-2,16.418

<bracket> <font> Aloud <$$font> <$$bracket> I am here at your request.
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.419

Speak quickly - PLANCHE-1846-2,16.420

consider the risk I run, PLANCHE-1846-2,16.421

and state in the fewest words the object of this interview.
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.422

<font> Hec. <$$font> First say that you love me!
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.423

Let me hear it once more from your own sweet lips.  PLANCHE-1846-2,16.424

<font> Ara. <$$font> My presence here, at such an hour, is a
sufficient answer.  PLANCHE-1846-2,16.425

Let me know why you exacted it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,16.426

<font> Hec. <$$font> You are about to be torn from me, to be
forced into the arms of another; PLANCHE-1846-2,16.427

can you wonder that I should pant to fold in mine, for the first,
and perhaps, the last time - <bracket> <font> Catches her in his arms.
<$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,16.428

<font> Ara. <$$font> Nay - I entreat, PLANCHE-1846-2,16.429

I implore; PLANCHE-1846-2,16.430

you alarm, PLANCHE-1846-2,16.431

<bracket> <font> breaks from him <$$font> <$$bracket> you offend me!
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.432

Oh, I have done wrong indeed, to meet you here; PLANCHE-1846-2,16.433

but it is unmanly, ungenerous of you, thus to reprove me.
PLANCHE-1846-2,16.434

<font> Hec. <$$font> Arabella!  <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font>
<$$bracket> Oh, burn it, PLANCHE-1846-2,16.435

I shall lose her, <P_17> and never know who I am!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.436

<bracket> <font> Aloud.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Adored Arabella pardon
the violence of my passion.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.437

Say you forgive your repentant - PLANCHE-1846-2,17.438

<bracket> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$bracket> If $she $'d {TEXT:she'd} only
tell me my Christian name, I might guess the other.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.439

<font> Ara. <$$font> I do forgive you, PLANCHE-1846-2,17.440

for the fault was mine.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.441

I have acted too lightly myself to censure the conduct of another.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.442

I feel I have forfeited my claim to that respect which pervaded your
letters, and gave a value to your love.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.443

Farewell, sir, it is not fitting I should remain here longer.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.444

<font> Hec. <$$font> Nay, you must not leave me thus.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.445

Recall the moment when in fancied security you faintly faltered forth
the name of - him you loved.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.446

Repeat that name!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.447

only repeat it, and it will be a spell to conjure back those soft
emotions.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.448

<font> Ara. <$$font> Repeat it!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.449

No, I shall endeavour to forget it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.450

The name of - <font> Hec. <$$font> Of - yes; of - go on - <font>
Ara. <$$font> Of him I loved - PLANCHE-1846-2,17.451

<font> Hec. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Oh, plague upon it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.452

<font> Ara. <$$font> That name was - <font> Hec.
<$$font> Was!  yes - it was - $you $'re {TEXT:you're} right.  <font>
Ara. <$$font> Was associated with all my fancy could imagine -
<font> Hec. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$bracket>
The $devil $'s {TEXT:devil's} in it.  <font> Ara. <$$font>
Of deep respectful devotion; of pure and delicate affection.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.453

But the spell is broken - PLANCHE-1846-2,17.454

I awake from a dream, in which I should never have indulged.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.455

Let me pass, sir - Nay, then - Lucy!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.456

<font> Hec. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Lucy, I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} bargain for that!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.457

I must beat a retreat!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.458

<bracket> <font> Aloud.  <$$font> <$$bracket> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} enough,
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.459

I see I have lost you.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.460

Farewell, farewell.  <bracket> <font> Exit, rapidly <$$font> L.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.461

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> You called!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.463

What is the matter?  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.464

He is gone.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.465

<font> Ara. <$$font> Oh, Lucy!  we have met, but to part for ever!
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.466

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Oh, a lover's quarrel!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.467

<font> Ara. <$$font> No, no; I will tell you all.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.468

Let us leave this place.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.469

Oh, Ormonde, Ormonde!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.470

you have indeed deceived me.  <font> Exit, {COM:sic} <$$font>

<font> Enter <$$font> Ormonde <font> and <$$font> Killiecrankie,
R. PLANCHE-1846-2,17.475

<font> Orm. <$$font> What strange news is this you bring me!
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.476

Barnwell dead?  <font> Kil. <$$font> As a pickled herring;
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.477

found last night stretched at fu'length in a copse near Teddington.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.478

<font> Orm. <$$font> And no evidence as to how he came by his
death?  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.479

<font> Kil. <$$font> Hoot toot, man, the clearest.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.480

There was a hole through his body big enough to let out as many lives
as a cat's!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.481

<font> Orm. <$$font> Most singular!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.482

Had he an affair upon his hands then, when our altercation took place;
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.483

or did he fall in some sudden and unlooked-for quarrel?
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.484

<font> Kil. <$$font> $There $'s {TEXT:There's} nae telling yet;
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.485

and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} odds, but if the dead man could speak, he $could
$na'{TEXT:couldna'} gie us much information on the subject - he was sae
drunk when they killed him.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.486

<font> Orm. <$$font> How know you that, if you know not who did it?
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.487

<font> Kil. <$$font> The host of The Toy says that he was
unco fu'when he reeled out o'his doors at a quarter to eleven.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.488

You ken $yourself {TEXT:yoursel} he was in a fair way towards it, when
we made our little appointment with him.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.489

<font> Orm. <$$font> Certainly, PLANCHE-1846-2,17.490

for I named it at the time, as a reason for not taking offence at his
madness.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.491

The wretched man, doubtless insulted some passing stranger, who took
immediate vengeance upon him.  <font> Kil. <$$font> And prevented
your meeting this morning, de'il tak {COM:sic} him!  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.492

Well, well, you must bear your disappointment like a man, Ormonde.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.493

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Killiecrankie, I wish I may never
have a more serious one to try my philosophy.  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.494

<font> Enter <$$font> Robert, <font> with a packet, <$$font> L.
PLANCHE-1846-2,17.495

What have you there, Robert?  PLANCHE-1846-2,17.496

<P_19>

<font> Rob. <$$font> A messenger, with this packet for your honour,
has ridden post-haste from London.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.498

<font> Orm. <$$font> A black seal!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.499

What doing else of death affecting me?  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.500

<bracket> <font> Opens PLANCHE-1846-2,19.501

and reads hastily <$$font> <$$bracket> PLANCHE-1846-2,19.502

Ha, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} surely a dream!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.503

<font> Kil. <$$font> Is there any offence in it?
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.504

If so - PLANCHE-1846-2,19.505

<font> Orm. <$$font> Offence, my dear major!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.506

read, read.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.507

<font> Kil {TEXT:missing_period} <$$font> <bracket> <font> Glancing over

Yer cousin, the marquis, deceased, without issue male,
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.509

and you the heir to his title and fortune.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.510

My service to your most honourable lordship!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.511

$Wha $'d {TEXT:Wha'd} ever ha'thought I should ha'lived to say sae.
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.512

<font> Orm. <$$font> My father's bitter enemy and mine.
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.513

I will not affect to sorrow for a loss which brings such gain along
with it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.514

At such a moment, too, - the most eventful of my life!
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.515

Oh, major!  you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} conceive the importance of this
unlooked-for elevation.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.516

<font> Kil. <$$font> Gude faith man!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.517

It requires nae great power of imagination to conceive the importance
of fifteen thousand pounds per annum, and a marquis's coronet, to a
landless lieutenant o'five-and-twenty!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.518

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} nae great arithmetician, PLANCHE-1846-2,19.519

but I can just add sae much to your twelve months'pay, and perceive a
considerable augmentation of the sum-total.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.520

<font> Orm. <$$font> Nay, nay - $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} neither
the money, nor the rank that could make my heart beat, as now it does
, but for the hope they bring withal.  The courage which my altered
position gives me to struggle for a prize a thousand times more valued.
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.521

<font> Kil. <$$font> A thousand times!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.522

Gude guide us, PLANCHE-1846-2,19.523

what can that be?  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.524

<font> Orm. <$$font> My old kind friend; my excellent
Killiecrankie, you shall know all ere long.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.525

A few hours will decide my fate.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.526

Excuse me now.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.527

Robert, let me see this messenger, PLANCHE-1846-2,19.528

and send to Captain O'Donoghue.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.529

I would speak with him instantly.  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.530

<font> Rob. <$$font> Yes, my lord marquis!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.531

This way my lord!  PLANCHE-1846-2,19.532

<bracket> <font> Exeunt, <$$font> L. PLANCHE-1846-2,19.533

<font> Kil. <$$font> The $lad $'s {TEXT:lad's} gane daft wi'

"A thousand times more valued! "PLANCHE-1846-2,19.535

Does he reckon on being made King o'Spain and the Indies?
PLANCHE-1846-2,19.536

Well, well I must say $it $'s {TEXT:it's} an ill wind that blows naebody
good, PLANCHE-1846-2,19.537

for if Barnwell had lived to fight Henry Ormonde this morning, $it $'s

<font> PLANCHE-1846-2,20.544

Hec. <$$font> My dear Ormonde, my darling boy!  long life to you!
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.545

So $you $'re {TEXT:you're} a peer of the realm, and rolling in riches,
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.546

and can make a marchioness of your tailor's daughter, or any other
good-looking young baggage you may take a fancy to.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.547

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Hector, there is no chance of my
forming such a <font> mes-alliance!  <$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,20.548

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, faith I $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't}
answer for you; PLANCHE-1846-2,20.549

for you fellows that swagger so about never falling in love, always
finish by making the greatest fools of yourselves.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.550

<font> Orm. <$$font> But I am in love, Hector!  Deeply, desperately
in love, PLANCHE-1846-2,20.551

and it was to consult you on the subject that I sent for you.
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.552

<font> Hec. <$$font> The devil you are!  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.553

And since when, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} be glad to know?  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.554

For you gave me your honour, last night, that you $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't}
a lady to quarrel for.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.555

<font> Orm. <$$font> Nor had I, then; PLANCHE-1846-2,20.556

nor have I, even now, a right to quarrel for her - perhaps not even to
name her - PLANCHE-1846-2,20.557

for she is ignorant of my love; PLANCHE-1846-2,20.558

but I have long adored her, although so utterly hopeless did I consider my
passion, that I scarcely avowed it even to myself.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.559

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, ye equivocating villain!  $ar $n't
{TEXT:arn't} you ashamed of yourself - to have deceived your best friend
in this fashion, and make him believe you were an icicle, all the while
you were a salamander.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.560

<font> Orm. <$$font> My dear Hector, you will never need to blush
for your own want of confidence.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.561

Had I but a tithe part of your confidence, I should have declared myself
to the lady long ago.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.562

<font> Hec. <$$font> And who is the lady, after all?
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.563

<font> Orm. <$$font> One whom you know well, at least by sight.
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.564

<font> Hec. <$$font> You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} say so!
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.565

Who?  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.566

<font> Orm. <$$font> An angel - PLANCHE-1846-2,20.567

$can $n't {TEXT:can't} you guess?  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.568

<font> Hec. <$$font> Not exactly, by that description.
PLANCHE-1846-2,20.569

I know so many angels, by sight.  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.570

<font> Orm. <$$font> Oh, but Arabella!  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.571

What Arabella?  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.573

<font> Orm. <$$font> Arabella Mordaunt The divine, enchanting
Lady Arabella Mordaunt!  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.574

<font> Hec. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside, after a long whistle
<$$font> <$$bracket> Phew!  PLANCHE-1846-2,20.575

Hector <P_21> O'Donoghue, by the mass $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} made a
beautiful blunder this time, PLANCHE-1846-2,21.576

and be hanged to you.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.577

<font> Orm. <$$font> Oh, the hours that I have watched but
for a distant glimpse of that form, which I dared not approach, lest
an uncontrollable glance should have revealed the secret of my soul.
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.578

Oh, the pangs which wrung my heart, when I heard that the queen had
declared her intention to give that matchless creature in marriage to
the Duke of Villa Hermosa: PLANCHE-1846-2,21.579

for though I felt the impossibility of her being mine, I had not
philosophy enough to contemplate the prospect of another's triumph!
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.580

But now, now my friend, I may boldly enter the lists and dispute the
prize, even with the duke.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.581

No longer a poor lieutenant of horse, my title, my fortune, authorize
my pretensions; PLANCHE-1846-2,21.582

and as I know she does not love the duke - PLANCHE-1846-2,21.583

<font> Hec. <$$font> The duke!  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.584

perhaps not - PLANCHE-1846-2,21.585

but are you sure she $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} love anybody else?
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.586

<font> Orm. <$$font> Oh, do not, I beseech you, destroy my new-born
hopes, by so fatal a suspicion.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.587

I have watched with all the Argus-eyed vigilance of a doting lover,
too prone to conjure up a rival in every shadow; PLANCHE-1846-2,21.588

yet though herself an object of general admiration and attention,
I have never been able to detect the slightest mask of preference,
the least token of favor.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.589

<font> Hec. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Poor divil!  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.590

And I $dare $n't {TEXT:daren't} tell him that I know she does love
somebody else.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.591

<font> Orm. <$$font> Now, my dear Hector, put yourself in my place.
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.592

<font> Hec. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Faith $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} done that without asking.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.593

<font> Orm. <$$font> And tell me what step you would take, how
you should proceed, under my circumstances?  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.594

<font> Hec. <$$font> Why, you see $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a mighty
ticklish sort of a matter, PLANCHE-1846-2,21.595

and I feel rather awkward in offering my advice on the subject.
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.596

<font> Orm. <$$font> It occurred to me - PLANCHE-1846-2,21.597

<font> Hec <$$font> Ah, $let $'s {TEXT:let's} know that!
PLANCHE-1846-2,21.598

Tell me first what occurred to you.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.599

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> For $it $'s {TEXT:it's}

<font> Orm. <$$font> Why, $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} pardon me for
alluding to it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.601

<font> Hec. <$$font> Pardon you; PLANCHE-1846-2,21.602

- to be sure I will.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.603

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> You may have to return
the compliment some day or other with interest.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.604

<font> Orm. <$$font> Well, then, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} aware of your
affection for Miss Desborough.  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.605

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, you are, are you?  PLANCHE-1846-2,21.606

Well, now you mention it I believe I have a sort of a <font> penchant.
<$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,21.607

<font> Orm. <$$font> And I have reason to think it is not
displeasing to the lady PLANCHE-1846-2,21.608

<P_22>

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, you have - PLANCHE-1846-2,22.610

well, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} happy to hear that anyhow.  PLANCHE-1846-2,22.611

<font> Orm. <$$font> Now, as she is the most intimate friend of
the Lady Arabella, you might serve me greatly by ascertaining through her
assistance, the real state of my adored one's heart; PLANCHE-1846-2,22.612

for should some happier mortal already have awaken'd an interest in it;
I will continue to suffer in silence the agony of a hopeless attachment
, and conjure you, my friend, to forget I have ever confessed to its

Captain O'Donoghue has just sent me word, the man who killed Barnwell
has been taken.  PLANCHE-1846-2,27.830

He is one of Monmouth's adherents, PLANCHE-1846-2,27.831

and has been in hiding since the battle of Sedgmoor -
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.832

having been suddenly met and recognised by Barnwell, who he knew would
denounce him - he drew upon him PLANCHE-1846-2,27.833

and slew him - PLANCHE-1846-2,27.834

<font> Ara. <$$font> And the letter - the charge of treason?
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.835

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> It was his cousin, the late marquis, to whom the
passage alluded.  PLANCHE-1846-2,27.836

It appears he was in secret correspondence with all the leaders of
the rebellion.  PLANCHE-1846-2,27.837

The king himself has signified his perfect confidence in the loyalty
of Lord Elrington, and promised to obtain her majesty's consent to your
marriage - PLANCHE-1846-2,27.838

so you see, dearest Arabella, instead of the terrible tragedy you
expected, the affair will turn out a comedy, and end as all comedies
should do, with a wedding.  PLANCHE-1846-2,27.839

<font> Ara. <$$font> How shall I ever repay you for your noble
friendship - your generous defence of me, to the queen, to the whole
court PLANCHE-1846-2,27.840

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> My dear creature, it was my defence as much
as yours.  PLANCHE-1846-2,27.841

I was the person who advised your meeting the young gentleman, and had
a right to share any disgrace that could fall upon you in consequence.
PLANCHE-1846-2,27.842

As it happens, your lover would have been acquitted without our extremely
handsome offer to prove an <font> alibi.  <$$font> PLANCHE-1846-2,27.843

But it has caused such fine gossip in the palace, and scandalized so many
malicious old maids, who can get no assignations at all, that it would
have been a thousand pities not to have made it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,27.844

<P_28>

<font> Ara. <$$font> Dear Lucy.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.846

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Besides $there $'s {TEXT:there's} an end
of the Duke of Villa Hermosa and his two and thirty quarters.
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.847

His grandeeship can never think of marrying a young lady, who has been
guilty of so shocking a piece of indecrorum.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.848

<font> Ara. <$$font> Alas, may not Lord Elrington himself hesitate
to marry one who has been made the subject of so much animadversion -
even though on his account?  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.849

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> It would be like his horrid sex.  I grant -
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.850

but I think better of Henry Ormonde.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.851

Should he, however, prove such a man-monster, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll}
marry that old Highland scarecrow, Major Killi-what-d'ye-call-him
{TEXT:Killi-what-d'ye_call_him}, on the special condition that he will
cut my Lord Elrington into Scotch collops, PLANCHE-1846-2,28.852

and $he $'ll {TEXT:he'll} do it at that price I know;
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.853

for he has been saying what he thinks tender things to me ever since
yesterday.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.854

<font> Ara. <$$font> And if the old Scotch major demurs, Lucy -
why, you $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} particularly object to make the
same bargain with the young Irish captain.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.855

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> O, my service to your ladyship - you are not under
much apprehension of your swain's ingratitude if you begin to banter me.
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.856

The young Irish captain, indeed - an impudent - handsome - good for
nothing - agreeable.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.857

Psha - hang the fellow - PLANCHE-1846-2,28.858

if he wants me to have him, why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} he say so in
good earnest.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.859

<font>> Enter <$$font> Page, L. PLANCHE-1846-2,28.860

<font> Page.  <$$font> The Marquis of Elrington is below, madam,
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.861

and requests permission to speak with your ladyship.
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.862

<font> Ara. <$$font> O, Lucy.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.863

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> O, Arabella, what a delicious flutter you are
in now.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.864

Show his lordship up.  <bracket> <font> To <$$font> Page.  <$$bracket>
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.865

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} vanish.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.866

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Page, L. PLANCHE-1846-2,28.867

<font> Ara. <$$font> Stay for a few minutes, till I have recovered
my compusure.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.868

<font> Lucy.  <$$font> Come with me then for the few minutes,
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.869

and let his lordship wait.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.870

If his love is as hot as it should be, it $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} get cold
in less than half an hour, I warrant you.  <bracket> <font> Exit <$$font>,
R. PLANCHE-1846-2,28.871

<font> Enter <$$font> Page, L. <font> and <$$font> Ormonde.
PLANCHE-1846-2,28.872

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font>, P. PLANCHE-1846-2,28.873

<font> Orm. <$$font> Not here!  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.874

Another moment to nerve myself for this interview, upon the result of
which all my hopes of happiness depend.  PLANCHE-1846-2,28.875

She may, she surely will explain this <P_29> mystery, which I have vainly
tortured my brain to unravel {TEXT:missing_period} PLANCHE-1846-2,29.876

That she loves me, has long known, and returned my affection, has become
a matter of notoriety to the whole court.  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.877

That her love prompted the astonishing declaration which she made
yesterday, may yet be possible.  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.878

That Miss Desvorough's generous friendship induced her to support that
assertion, may be equally so.  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.879

But if, as I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help fearing, some deception has
been practised on her, there is as much danger to her happiness in
unmasking it, as to mine in the cruel conviction!  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.880

Heaven grant me coolness enough to question without alarming her -
PLANCHE-1846-2,29.881

she comes!  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.882

<font> Enter <$$font> Arabella, R. PLANCHE-1846-2,29.883

<font> Ara. <$$font> My lord!  <bracket> <font> timidly, and then
with a burst of feeling.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Henry, my dearest Henry,
- blessed be providence you are safe!  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.884

<font> Orm. <$$font> In what words can I express my rapture,
my gratitude, for such unexampled proofs of your affection!  How, at
the same time, convey to you an idea of what I have suffered, what I
still suffer at the recollection of the sacrifice you have made for me.
PLANCHE-1846-2,29.885

<font> Ara. <$$font> What sacrifice?  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.886

The favor of the queen?  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.887

His majesty has graciously offered his mediation - PLANCHE-1846-2,29.888

a marriage with a foreign nobleman, whom I have never seen, and could
never love; you will not call that a sacrifice?  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.889

<font> Orm. <$$font> But your name, Arabella - your fair name
to be made the bye-word of the court.  The title of a hundred absurd
and scandalous stories; your conduct censured, your honor, perhaps,
called in question.  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.890

<font> Ara. <$$font> If <font> you <$$font> do not question it - if
<font> you <$$font> do not censure my conduct, what care I for the world.
PLANCHE-1846-2,29.891

Was I to stand calmly by, hear you accused of the most dreadful crime;
see your life in peril, and not speak the words could save you, and
those words the truth!  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.892

<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
The truth!  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.893

<font> Ara. <$$font> Had I not even loved you as I do, could I
have offered you to perish, when it was in my power so clearly to prove
your innocence?  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.894

<font> Orm. <$$font> And had your testimony been needed, you would
not have hesitated, in a public court of justice, to have confirmed it
by a sacred oath!  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.895

<font> Ara. <$$font> Assuredly not - PLANCHE-1846-2,29.896

nor my dear friend, Miss Desborough, by whose advice I consented to
the meeting so $urgently {COM:word_unclear} requested in your $note
{TEXT:vote}.  PLANCHE-1846-2,29.897

<P_30>

<font> Orm. <$$font> My note!  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.899

Hah, well thought of!  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.900

Let me see that note.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.901

I - PLANCHE-1846-2,30.902

<font> Ara. <$$font> I have destroyed it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.903

<font> Orm. <$$font> Destroyed it.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.904

<font> Ara <$$font> Certainly, as I have all your other letters, by your
own request.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.905

Indeed, common prudence would have induced me.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.906

Had one of them fallen into the hands of her majesty, altho'unsigned -
<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Unsigned!  <font> Ara. <$$font> They might have led to the
discovery of the writer <font> PLANCHE-1846-2,30.907

Orm. <$$font> True, they might.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.908

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> And that clue is denied me!
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.909

<font> Ara. <$$font> And from the moment when accident wafted to
your ear my unguarded confession - to that of our first and only secret
meeting in Queen Mary's Bower - <font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket>
<font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> First and only - <font> Ara.
<$$font> I have trembled lest a look, or a word, should escape either
of us, which might awake suspicion; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.910

for you were then a poor lieutenant, without fortune, without influence
, at the mercy of those whose anger could and would have crushed you.
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.911

You are now an $independent {TEXT:indepeendnt} nobleman
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.912

and can justify your pretension; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.913

but do not forget, Henry, it was whilst you were poor and friendless
that Arabella first saw and loved you - PLANCHE-1846-2,30.914

and believe me, that when startled by your manner the other night,
I broke from your arms.  {COM:sic} it was in sorrow, more than anger,
and because I felt I had more to fear from my own heart than from yours.
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.915

<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
It is too plain; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.916

my worst suspicions are verified!  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.917

What villain - what base, treacherous villain!  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.918

<font> Ara. <$$font> Henry, you are moved, distressed.
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.919

There is no cause, PLANCHE-1846-2,30.920

I have forgiven you - PLANCHE-1846-2,30.921

nay, was to blame myself, perhaps - too hasty, too severe.
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.922

<font> Orm. <$$font> No, no, no, you are the noblest of your sex,
as in my sight you are the fairest.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.923

The wretch that could tamper with such a heart as yours, should be torn
piece meal.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.924

An honest sword would be for ever tarnished with his blood.
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.925

<font> $Ara. {TEXT:Ora.} <$$font> Henry, you terrify me!
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.926

Who should tamper with me?  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.927

<font> Orm. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Kneels.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Not I, not I; PLANCHE-1846-2,30.928

at your feet, Arabella, I swear eternal fidelity to you, and vengeance
upon any who shall dare to breathe a whisper to your prejudice!
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.929

<bracket> <font> Rises.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Farewell!  but for a short
time, PLANCHE-1846-2,30.930

I will return to claim you with the sanction of the queen,
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.931

and will devote my life to the repayment of your love, and the vindication
of your honor.  <bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Ormonde, {COM:word_unclear}
PLANCHE-1846-2,30.932

<font> Ara. <$$font> Happy, happy Arabella.  PLANCHE-1846-2,30.933
