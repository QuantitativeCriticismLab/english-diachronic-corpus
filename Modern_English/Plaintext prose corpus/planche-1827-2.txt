The Green-eyed Monster.  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.3

Act I.  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.4

Scene I.  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.5

- <font> A Shrubbery in the Grounds of Baron Speyenhausen.  <$$font>
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.6

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Colonel Arnsdorf <font> and <$$font> Marcus,
L. PLANCHE-1827-2,9.8

<font> Col. <$$font> Not approach the house, when my love is
returned, and my intentions are honourable?  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.9

<font> Mar. <$$font> Not during the baron's absence, sir.
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.10

He is expected home to-morrow, and then - PLANCHE-1827-2,9.11

<font> Col. <$$font> To-morrow!  to-morrow!  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.12

- why should I be debarred for a moment the sight of my Amelia?
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.13

- what could the baron say?  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.14

<font> Mar. <$$font> He would say nothing, sir - nothing but what
would be perfectly polite and gentlemanly.  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.15

His consent, indeed, you might hope in vain for; PLANCHE-1827-2,9.16

but his reception of you would be the most fascinating thing possible.
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.17

How fortunate for you, sir, that I should not only have entered the
baron's service within the last six months, but be the first person you
met upon the grounds.  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.18

If any one else had seen you, $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} have been ruined, sir.
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.19

<font> Col. <$$font> What do you mean?  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.20

<font> Mar. <$$font> You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know the baron,
sir; PLANCHE-1827-2,9.21

nor do you seem aware of the crime you have committed.
PLANCHE-1827-2,9.22

<font> Col. <$$font> Crime!  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.23

what crime?  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.24

<font> Mar. <$$font> Why, sir, you have fallen desperately in
love with Lady Speyenhausen.  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.25

<font> Col. <$$font> With the baroness!  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.26

what do you mean by this impertinence?  PLANCHE-1827-2,9.27

<font> Mar. <$$font> Nay, sir, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} be angry
with me: PLANCHE-1827-2,9.28

her husband believes you have, which is exactly the same thing, as far
as he is concerned; PLANCHE-1827-2,9.29

and that belief is not likely to be shaken by the report that, during his
absence, you <P_10> have jumped over a quickset hedge into his shrubbery,
instead of ringing the great bell in the forecourt, and leaving a card
with the porter.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.30

<font> Col. <$$font> Psha!  it saved my going a mile about;
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.31

and, so far from knowing he was absent, I came expressly to see him,
to ask the hand of his ward; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.32

and I shall await his return in her company.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.33

<font> Mar. <$$font> Then, sir, I repeat, $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll}
ruin all.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.34

- You are the suspected person - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.35

your attentions at a certain fancy ball in Munich - <font> Col.
<$$font> Were directed to Amelia.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.36

<font> Mar. <$$font> You followed the carriage home -
<font> Col. <$$font> To discover the residence of Amelia.
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.37

<font> Mar. <$$font> You prowled about the house, night after
night, PLANCHE-1827-2,10.38

and serenaded yourself into a quinsey - <font> Col. <$$font>
For Amelia!  for Amelia!  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.39

I had not then my father's consent, PLANCHE-1827-2,10.40

and was compelled to be very cautious in my proceedings.
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.41

<font> Mar. <$$font> Have you it now, sir?  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.42

<font> Col. <$$font> I have.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.43

<font> Mar. <$$font> In writing?  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.44

<font> Col. <$$font> No; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.45

but - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.46

<font> Mar. <$$font> There it is, sir; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.47

you have nothing to prove your affection is really for Mademoiselle
Amelia.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.48

<font> Col. <$$font>'Sdeath!  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.49

when I come to ask her in marriage?  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.50

<font> Mar. <$$font> It does not signify, PLANCHE-1827-2,10.51

the baron will consider that a mere pretence to gain admission to the
house, and approach my lady.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.52

<font> Col. <$$font> But I expect a letter, this very day, from my
father; which I have ordered to be forwarded to Engleberg Castle to me.
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.53

<font> Mar. <$$font> Then wait till you get it, sir:
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.54

at any rate do not think of setting foot over the threshold of our house
before the baron returns.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.55

You have no idea how ingeniously he can torment himself and every one
around him - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.56

a glance, a cough, a whisper, drives him mad - PLANCHE-1827-2,10.57

explanations are idle; PLANCHE-1827-2,10.58

for, so completely is he the slave of the green-eyed monster, that he
rather seeks to create doubts than to dissipate them, PLANCHE-1827-2,10.59

and tortures the clearest proofs of his folly into the strongest food
for his fear.  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.60

Do you see that little girl tripping across the lawn, yonder?
PLANCHE-1827-2,10.61

<font> Col. <$$font> What of her?  PLANCHE-1827-2,10.62

<font> Mar. <$$font> Why that, now, is one of the baron's spies
, little Luise, an orphan, taken into his service expressly to <P_11>
watch proceedings during his absence.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.63

He has promised her in marriage to another of his creatures, Kraut the
gardener - Sour Kraut, as we call him - who is as mad as his master, and
glories in displaying, while the baron labours to conceal, his jealousy.
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.64

<font> Col. <$$font> But, then, if she sees us together -
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.65

<font> Mar. <$$font> Oh, never mind that - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.66

she and I are great friends.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.67

Kraut worries her to death, PLANCHE-1827-2,11.68

and we have determined between us that he shall not be jealous for
nothing.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.69

But, if he should set eyes on you - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.70

<font> Col. <$$font> Oh, a few florins, I suppose -
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.71

<font> Mar. <$$font> Oh, bless you!  no sir.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.72

Incorruptible, like me.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.73

<font> Col. <$$font> Like you, indeed!  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.74

<font> Mar. <$$font> Yes, sir, like me: PLANCHE-1827-2,11.75

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} a reformed man, sir; quite another person to the
roguish, intriguing, fibbing, impudent fellow you knew at Vienna -
who took as many fees as a physician, and did nearly as much mischief.
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.76

My eyes are open to the enormity of my former ways, sir:
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.77

and it must be a - great - a very - great temptation, which could induce
me to return to them.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.78

<font> Col. <$$font> Ay, ay!  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.79

<font> Mar. <$$font> $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not going to be a
tale-bearer, certainly; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.80

but you must expect no assistance from me, further than the mere holding
my tongue, sir.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.81

<font> Col. <$$font> Humph!  $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you think
you could hold your hand, Marcus, if you thought I should put anything
into it?  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.82

<font> Mar. <$$font> Anything but a bribe, certainly.
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.83

<font> Col. <$$font> A bribe!  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.84

I should blush at the idea.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.85

But, since you so strongly advise me not to present myself at the house,
I wish you to deliver a letter to Amelia; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.86

and I am sure, out of friendship for me, you will just take care of this
purse, till I ask you for it again.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.87

<font> Mar. <$$font> Friendship!  Ah!  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.88

there, now, you attack me on my weak side.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.89

What I would not have done for a mine of gold, that little word compels
me to, without a moment's hesitation.  PLANCHE-1827-2,11.90

The letter shall be delivered, sir; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.91

and, conjured by that sacred name, I put the purse in my pocket.
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.92

And now, sir, let me recommend you to retreat by the way you came, and
lie concealed at the castle, till I give you information of the baron's
return; PLANCHE-1827-2,11.93

then come down boldly to the house - the front way, mind you -
PLANCHE-1827-2,11.94

ring a peal on the great bell - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.95

send up your name - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.96

produce the letter you say you expect - PLANCHE-1827-2,11.97

{COM:previous_imperatives_also_part_of_the_pseudo-imperative} demand
the hand of Mademoiselle Amelia; and he must be <P_12> madder than even
I think him, if we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} convince him you have no
designs upon my lady.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.98

<font> Col. <$$font> Well, you used to be a tolerably
knowing fellow, when you were in my uncle's service, at Vienna;
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.99

and $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} take your advice in this affair, which I confess
presents more difficulties than I could possibly have anticipated.
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.100

<bracket> <font> Takes out his pocket-book, PLANCHE-1827-2,12.101

writes in a blank leaf, PLANCHE-1827-2,12.102

tears it out, PLANCHE-1827-2,12.103

and gives it to Marcus.  <$$font> <$$bracket> PLANCHE-1827-2,12.104

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} the note - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.105

deliver it directly, PLANCHE-1827-2,12.106

and give me immediate notice of the baron's return.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.107

<bracket> <font> Crosses to <$$font> L. PLANCHE-1827-2,12.108

<font> Mar. <$$font> Mind nobody sees you jump over the hedge, sir.
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.109

<font> Col. <$$font> Ay, ay; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.110

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} set you an example of prudence to all marrying men -
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.111

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} look before I leap, Marcus.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.112

<bracket> <font> Exit, <$$font> L. PLANCHE-1827-2,12.113

<font> Mar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Looking at the purse.
<$$font> <$$bracket> So will I.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.114

Ten ducats - I think I may jump.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.115

Now $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the sort of person who ought to succeed;
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.116

and it shall not be my fault if he does not.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.117

My lady should assist me in this business: PLANCHE-1827-2,12.118

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} as much to her interest as the colonel's, to convince
the baron, her niece, and not herself, is the object of his attraction.
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.119

I know the name of Arnsdorf has been wormwood to him ever since the
masked ball at Munich, from which the colonel dogged the ladies home.
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.120

Hah!  here comes Luise - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.121

what a bustle the girl seems in.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.122

<font> Enter <$$font> Luise, R. U. E.
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.123

<font> Mar. <$$font> Well, Luise; I thought you had forgotten me.
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.124

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Oh, no, Mr. Marcus - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.125

but - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.126

<font> Mar. <$$font> But what?  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.127

you seem scared.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.128

<font> Luise.  <$$font> $Master $'s {TEXT:Master's} come home!
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.129

<font> Mar. <$$font> The baron!  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.130

why, how did he come?  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.131

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} heard no carriage.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.132

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Oh dear, no; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.133

he must have left the carriage somewhere, and walked through the wood
to the house - PLANCHE-1827-2,12.134

for I was on the terrace, PLANCHE-1827-2,12.135

and I saw him slide down into the dry ditch, and creep close under the
wall, all the way round to the little gate in the park, open it with
his master-key, and slip in.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.136

<font> Mar. <$$font> And what did you do?  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.137

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Ran to tell my lady; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.138

but, as I went up the great staircase, he came up the back -
PLANCHE-1827-2,12.139

and so we met on the landing-place; PLANCHE-1827-2,12.140

and he sent me down again, PLANCHE-1827-2,12.141

and told me not to say a word about his arrival, as he wished to give
my mistress a pleasurable surprise.  PLANCHE-1827-2,12.142

<font> Mar. <$$font> Dear man!  $that $'s {TEXT:that's} so like
him: PLANCHE-1827-2,12.143

write to say he <P_13> shall be at home on such a day,
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.144

then come the day before - just to give his wife a pleasant surprise;
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.145

glide into the house as if he was going to steal his own
silver candlesticks - all to give his wife a pleasant surprise!
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.146

$He $'ll {TEXT:He'll} get shot for a poacher, some day, by his own
gamekeeper - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.147

and that <font> will <$$font> give his wife a pleasant surprise!
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.148

Well, my little Venus, have you thought on what I said to you the
other day?  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.149

<font> Luise.  <$$font> About Kraut?  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.150

<font> Mar. <$$font> Yes, my darling.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.151

You find, upon consideration, that you love me a great deal better than
you do him.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.152

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Why, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know, because
you see $it $'s {TEXT:it's} quite another sort of love I have for him,
to that which I have for you.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.153

<font> Mar. <$$font> So I should hope, my angel:
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.154

but $what $'s {TEXT:what's} the difference, now?  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.155

You can tell me that.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.156

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Oh!  $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} known Kraut ever since
I was <font> that <$$font> high, and loved him little by little, because
he told me I ought to do so - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.157

now the other love came all of a sudden - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.158

Boh!  there it was.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.159

<font> Mar. <$$font> Boh!  there it was!  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.160

Bless her unsophisticated heart!  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.161

what a nice little fellow it is!  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.162

but I must run and overtake the colonel, with the news.
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.163

I hope the baron $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} catch a glimpse of him, in his
retreat, PLANCHE-1827-2,13.164

for that would settle the business.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.165

By-by, my Hebe - one sweet kiss, PLANCHE-1827-2,13.166

and - PLANCHE-1827-2,13.167

<font> Enter <$$font> Kraut, R. U. E.
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.168

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Forty thousand devils!  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.169

<bracket> <font> Rushes between them.  <$$font> PLANCHE-1827-2,13.170

<font> Mar. <$$font> Sour Kraut, by all $that $'s {TEXT:that's}
unpleasant!  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.171

Run, run.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.172

<bracket> <font> Exeunt Luise and Marcus <$$font>, L., <font>

<$$font>, <$$bracket> Ha, ha, ha!  pardon me, my dear Lady Speyenhausen,

but I must laugh, ha, ha, ha!  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.181

<font> Lady.  <$$font> But what at, my dear?  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.182

I am delighted to see you so merry, PLANCHE-1827-2,13.183

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} understand what particularly excites
your risibility.  PLANCHE-1827-2,13.184

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  I shall die with laughing -
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.185

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} the most comical thing in the world.
PLANCHE-1827-2,13.186

<P_14>

<font> Lady.  <$$font> What is comical?  PLANCHE-1827-2,14.188

Certainly, nothing you have told me - PLANCHE-1827-2,14.189

you say that the old Countess of Kirchenberg is dead, and that, contrary
to expectation, she has not left her nephew a florin, but bequeathed the
whole of her property to an officer who was distantly related to her -
PLANCHE-1827-2,14.190

now, what is there comical in this story?  PLANCHE-1827-2,14.191

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  $It $'s {TEXT:It's} not the
story - PLANCHE-1827-2,14.192

but you asked me in such a careless manner -"Do you know the officer?

Is he young - handsome?  PLANCHE-1827-2,14.194

In what regiment? "PLANCHE-1827-2,14.195

In a tone, I say, of such utter indifference, as if - ha, ha, ha!
as if it was of no earthly consequence to you, ha!  ha!  ha!

Why are our friends to be sent from our door, because I $do $n't

PLANCHE-1827-2,14.222

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help laughing, though it annoys me, at the
extreme folly of the thing.  PLANCHE-1827-2,14.223

I, who, during the five years'{COM:sic} we have been married, never
laid the slightest constraint upon your pleasures, your inclinations
<P_15> - I, whose extreme anxiety to escape so odious a charge - <font>
Lady.  <$$font> Betrays the troubled source from whence it springs.
PLANCHE-1827-2,15.224

Baron Speyenhausen, you will excuse my finishing the sentence for you,
and allow me also to repeat, for perhaps the hundredth time since our
marriage, that, being as anxious to avoid affording you a pretence
for jealousy, as you are to escape the suspicion of entertaining it,
the unlimited freedom to which you allude has ever been, and ever will
be, until your nature changes, the most severe restriction that can be
imposed upon my actions.  PLANCHE-1827-2,15.225

<font> Bar. <$$font> Very well, madam - as you please:
PLANCHE-1827-2,15.226

but my character, Lady Speyenhausen, shall not suffer for your folly;
PLANCHE-1827-2,15.227

my nature, as you phrase it, shall not be seen through the glasses of
your prejudice; PLANCHE-1827-2,15.228

I will throw my doors wide open - PLANCHE-1827-2,15.229

they never shall be shut, day or night; PLANCHE-1827-2,15.230

I will make my house an hotel, and my park a thoroughfare;
PLANCHE-1827-2,15.231

I will write to Colonel Arnsdorf - Colonel Arnsdorf, madam!  the gentleman
whom you evidently think I fear; PLANCHE-1827-2,15.232

$I $'ll invite him to my table, go abroad as soon as he comes, and leave
you to do the honours; PLANCHE-1827-2,15.233

<font> Enter <$$font> Colonel Arnsdorf, R. PLANCHE-1827-2,15.243

My dear colonel, this is an unexpected pleasure, ha, ha, ha!  and -
the most curious coincidence possible: PLANCHE-1827-2,15.244

would you believe it - I was, at the moment of your arrival, telling Lady
Speyenhausen that I intended writing to you, and requesting the favour
of your company for a few days, during the approaching shooting-season,
ha, ha, ha!  PLANCHE-1827-2,15.245

PLANCHE-1827-2,16.262

<font> Lady.  <$$font> I have to congratulate Colonel Arnsdorf, I believe,
upon his accession to some considerable property.  PLANCHE-1827-2,16.263

<font> Col. <$$font> Indeed, madam, I do not consider it as a
subject for congratulation: PLANCHE-1827-2,16.264

the right heir has been most capriciously deprived of it,
PLANCHE-1827-2,16.265

and I am impatient till my lawyers arrange some plan for its
restoration to him, without infringing the commands of the will.

PLANCHE-1827-2,16.276

and, my love, order refreshments into the dining-parlour -
PLANCHE-1827-2,16.278

you pay no attention to your guests.  PLANCHE-1827-2,16.279

<font> Col. <$$font> None for me, I beg - PLANCHE-1827-2,16.280

PLANCHE-1827-2,16.289

<bracket> <font> Exit with Colonel, <$$font> L.
PLANCHE-1827-2,16.290

<font> Lady.  <$$font> What is to be done?  PLANCHE-1827-2,16.291

The baron's malady increases daily, in spite of every plan, every
exertion.  PLANCHE-1827-2,16.292

My invention and my patience are alike exhausted.  PLANCHE-1827-2,16.293

If the storm would rise and burst, well and good; PLANCHE-1827-2,16.294

there might be some hope of the weather clearing; PLANCHE-1827-2,16.295

but I am weary of seeing a cloud for ever on the horizon, which, despite
its golden hues and fleecy softness, I know bears thunder in its bosom.
PLANCHE-1827-2,16.296

<font> Enter <$$font> Amelia, R. PLANCHE-1827-2,16.297

<font> Ame. <$$font> Oh, my dear aunt!  PLANCHE-1827-2,16.298

I am so pleased, and so <P_17> frightened!  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.299

Colonel Arnsdorf is here; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.300

I saw him cross the lawn: PLANCHE-1827-2,17.301

what can he be come for?  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.302

<font> Lady.  <$$font> To make a formal proposal, I hope, my love,
to your guardian; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.303

and would he had done so two years ago!  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.304

<font> Ame. <$$font> But you know, my dear aunt, that was
impossible; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.305

his father insisted on his marrying the only daughter of Count Persenberg
; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.306

but the young lady has pleased herself, and eloped with her music-master
, PLANCHE-1827-2,17.307

and Frederick's hand is now as free as his heart is faithful.
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.308

<font> Lady.  <$$font> <bracket> <font> Smiling.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
And so, being perfectly aware of these circumstances, you wonder what
he can be come for?  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.309

But let me advise you, my dear Amelia, not to be too sanguine;
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.310

I have strong fears that your uncle's consent will not be easily obtained.
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.311

<font> Ame. <$$font> Mercy on me!  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.312

why, what objection can he possibly make?  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.313

<font> Lady.  <$$font> You know it was my poor sister's dying request ,
that, while we both lived, I should never suffer you, married or single,
to reside under another roof.  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.314

Baron Speyhenhausen, as my husband and your guardian, pledged himself
to respect that injunction.  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.315

If Colonel Arnsdorf, therefore, should become your husband, he must
inevitably reside with us.  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.316

<font> Ame. <$$font> Well, and provided the colonel has no
objection - PLANCHE-1827-2,17.317

<font> Lady.  <$$font> The baron has one, an insuperable one.
PLANCHE-1827-2,17.318

My dear Amelia, it is painful, humiliating to me, to enter into this
explanation; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.319

but - you are aware of the baron's foible, his incurable, but secret
jealousy.  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.320

Ever since that unlucky evening, when, having, with his usual affectation
of confidence, absolutely compelled us to go to the Austrian minister's
fancy-ball, he heard Colonel Arnsdorf followed our carriage to the door
of our mansion in Munich, Baron Speyenhausen has persisted in the belief
that I am the object of his pursuit; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.321

and all my endeavours to convince him of your mutual attachment he
obstinately considers as attempts to hoodwink him to the real state of
the case.  PLANCHE-1827-2,17.322

<font> Ame. <$$font> But, surely, this open proposition of the
colonel's - <font> Lady.  <$$font> Would convince anybody but Baron
Speyenhausen, PLANCHE-1827-2,17.323

and I sincerely hope it may him; PLANCHE-1827-2,17.324

but jealousy has so distorted his perceptions, that I confess I should
not be surprised, if he saw nothing in that proposal, <P_18> but a plan
of the colonel's to establish himself, at any price, in the same house
with me.  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.325

<font> Ame. <$$font> Ridiculous!  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.326

<font> Lady.  <$$font> But too probable, as you may shortly have an
opportunity of assuring yourself.  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.327

<bracket> <font> Goes up <$$font> C. PLANCHE-1827-2,18.328

<font> Ame. <$$font> What do I hear!  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.329

my uncle, with all his foolish fancies, can never be so absurd as to
imagine - PLANCHE-1827-2,18.330

or, mercy on me!  should it be true!  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.331

My aunt is still a young woman - a handsome woman; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.332

Frederick always spoke in raptures of her: PLANCHE-1827-2,18.333

can he be so false - so base - so - oh dear - oh dear!
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.334

Sure, $jealousy $'s {TEXT:jealousy's} catching; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.335

I begin to have such strange sensations - PLANCHE-1827-2,18.336

I - PLANCHE-1827-2,18.337

<font> Lady.  <$$font> Here comes the baron again, and without the
colonel; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.338

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} as I feared, then.  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.339

<font> Ame. <$$font> Without Frederick!  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.340

<font> Bar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
So, $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} got rid of the colonel; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.342

the plan was too obvious; PLANCHE-1827-2,18.343

he saw I penetrated it, PLANCHE-1827-2,18.344

and retired in confusion!  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.345

Now will my wife put all sorts of questions to me to know the why and
the wherefore, PLANCHE-1827-2,18.346

but $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} disappoint her.  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.347

<bracket> <font> Goes up <$$font> C., PLANCHE-1827-2,18.348

he would be sure to misconstrue my motives.  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.352

<bracket> <font> Exit Lady Speyenhausen.  <$$font> PLANCHE-1827-2,18.353

<font> Bar. <$$font> Gone!  Gone without a word!
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.356

Now, what can be more convincing?  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.357

Were there no understanding between them, $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't}

PLANCHE-1827-2,18.358

But no, $she $'s {TEXT:she's} afraid to venture on the subject.
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.360

And the impudence of that fellow!  to pretend a passion for Amelia all
the while - nay, to propose marriage!  PLANCHE-1827-2,18.361

But $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} got rid of him for ever, if he has any prudence

Why, zounds, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} not gone though, yet!
PLANCHE-1827-2,18.363

PLANCHE-1827-2,19.380

professed his sincere sorrow at being obliged to refuse my request;
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.381

assured me there was no mortal breathing he would be prouder to admit to
his family, but that he had, unfortunately, passed his word to another,
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.382

and therefore, painful as it was to him, he must request me to abandon
all thoughts of Amelia.  PLANCHE-1827-2,19.383

<font> Mar. <font> It is no more than I expected.
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.384

<font> Col. <$$font> Vehemently!  PLANCHE-1827-2,19.386

Threw myself at his feet; PLANCHE-1827-2,19.387

implored his pity; PLANCHE-1827-2,19.388

started up again, PLANCHE-1827-2,19.389

and accused him of cruelty to his ward, and injustice to the baroness.
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.390

his fury; forced a laugh, at what he called my egregious mistake, and
begged me, of all things, to stay dinner {COM:sic_without_preposition}.
PLANCHE-1827-2,19.395

I swore I $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} stay another moment in the house,

What can I do?  PLANCHE-1827-2,19.398

See her, I must, and will; PLANCHE-1827-2,19.399

<font> Bar. <$$font> The more I think on this business, the more
I am puzzled!  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.439

Should I be wrong!  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.440

- should the colonel have gone to such a length, as to propose marriage
, for the mere purpose of furthering his designs on the baroness.
PLANCHE-1827-2,20.441

It seems incredible, PLANCHE-1827-2,20.442

and Amelia really loves him.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.443

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} taxed her with it, PLANCHE-1827-2,20.444

and she is broken-hearted about my refusal.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.445

But were I to consent!  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.446

- Say they were married, living under the same roof with my wife -
PLANCHE-1827-2,20.447

might not his affection cool for my niece, and his manners and person
gradually captivate the aunt, who is already but too much prepossessed
in his favour.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.448

Yes, yes!  it would be dangerous to the peace of the poor girl.
PLANCHE-1827-2,20.449

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} better as it is; PLANCHE-1827-2,20.450

he has his answer; PLANCHE-1827-2,20.451

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} gone.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.452

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Oh sir, horrible news!  frightful news!
PLANCHE-1827-2,20.457

PLANCHE-1827-2,20.458

<font> Bar. <$$font> Eh!  why - PLANCHE-1827-2,20.459

what - PLANCHE-1827-2,20.460

what news - PLANCHE-1827-2,20.461

something fresh about Luise.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.462

Eh!  $you $'re {TEXT:you're} always worrying yourself about some trifle
or another, PLANCHE-1827-2,20.463

- I wonder you $a'$n't {TEXT:a'nt} ashamed to let people see your silly
jealousy.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.464

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Not I.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.465

I say to all the world $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} jealous, PLANCHE-1827-2,20.466

and $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} more so now than ever - PLANCHE-1827-2,20.467

this new jager of yours, sir, Master Marcus - PLANCHE-1827-2,20.468

<font> Bar. <$$font> Marcus!  what of him?  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.469

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> I want an excuse to send
him packing.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.470

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> I caught him kissing Luise in the shrubbery
this morning.  PLANCHE-1827-2,20.471

<P_21>

<font> Bar. <$$font> Then I shall discharge him instantly.
PLANCHE-1827-2,21.473

The rascal knows very well that you have my consent to marry her; that
she is as good as contracted to you; PLANCHE-1827-2,21.474

and I will have no such libertine in my establishment.
PLANCHE-1827-2,21.475

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Oh, sir!  $you $'re {TEXT:you're} my only
consolation; PLANCHE-1827-2,21.476

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} a horrid libertine, that Marcus; PLANCHE-1827-2,21.477

for he is not content with making love to her herself {COM:sic},
PLANCHE-1827-2,21.478

but he takes bribes to betray her to another - a fine gentleman,
an officer.  PLANCHE-1827-2,21.479

<font> Bar. <$$font> An officer!  PLANCHE-1827-2,21.480

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Hush!  I saw him this morning jump over the
hedge there, out of the shrubbery - PLANCHE-1827-2,21.481

<font> Bar. Out <$$font> of the shrubbery!  PLANCHE-1827-2,21.482

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Oh, that I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know;

but are you sure it was he?  PLANCHE-1827-2,21.495

<font> Kraut.  <$$font> Certain.  PLANCHE-1827-2,21.496

the arbiter of her fate, has, from a ridiculous motive, of which, I

every way desirable.  PLANCHE-1827-2,27.774

monster incarnate.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1101

The baron is in his study brooding upon his supposed wrongs, and hatching
mortal vengeance.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1102

Luise, if perfect in her lesson, is with him by this time,
PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1103

and Kraut will make his appearance just in the nick, to crown the
glorious confusion.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1104

Scene III.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1107

- <font> Interior of the Baron's Study - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1108

glass-door in the centre, with blinds drawn down - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1109

arm-chair - an India cabinet, <$$font> L., PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1110

<font> Bar. <$$font> $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} done it;
PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1114

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} broken out.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1115

It will be all over the country!  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1116

I shall be the talk of the whole kingdom!  a jealous husband - the wonder
of Germany!  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1117

I shall be made a show of - stared at like a <font> lusus naturae <$$font>
- hunted like a wild beast - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1118

serve him right, says one for marrying a woman so much younger than
himself - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1119

"why $did $n't {TEXT:did'nt} {COM:sic} he go to Italy or England,
"says another: PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1120

"$he $'d {TEXT:he'd} have had company there - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1121

but to be jealous in Germany! "PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1122

and this in addition to my sufferings - to my tortures - Ugh!
PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1123

to be flayed alive first, and then crammed into a nest of hornets,
PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1124

and for what?  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1125

For not sitting down quietly, and seeing my wife seduced under my
own nose!  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1126

But then, if I should be mistaken - If {COM:sic} it was, as she says,
that he really was soliciting her interest only - I wish $I $'d {TEXT:I'd}
read the letter PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1127

- I wish - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1128

I wish - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1129

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what I wish, or what to do, or what to
think - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1130

<bracket> <font> Knock at the door.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1131

How now?  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1132

$Who $'s {TEXT:Who's} there?  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1133

<font> Enter <$$font> Luise <font> at the glass-door <$$font>, C. ,
<font> opening it cautiously.  <$$font> PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1134

<font> Luise.  <$$font> <bracket> <font> Advancing slowly.  <$$font>
<$$bracket> My lord.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1135

<font> Bar. <$$font> Luise!  who sent for you?
PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1136

what do you want?  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1137

Go away directly - PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1138

how dare you come here?  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1139

you know I never let any body come here.  PLANCHE-1827-2,35.1140

<P_36>

<font> Luise.  <$$font> But if you please, my lord, you told me always
to tell you when I saw anything going forward, PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1142

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} understand - PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1143

<font> Bar. <$$font> Eh!  well, so I did; PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1144

and what, is there anything going forward, then?  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1145

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Yes, my lord; something very strange indeed!
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1146

<font> Bar. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
Ah!  now perhaps this may lead to something - PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1147

this may satisfy me one way or the other.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1148

<bracket> <font> Aloud.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Come in,
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1149

come in directly, PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1150

and shut the door.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1151

- Now - now speak - PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1152

what is it?  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1153

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Indeed, my lord, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} so frightened,
I hardly can speak.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1154

<font> Bar. <$$font> Pho!  pho!  $do $n't {TEXT:don't} be
frightened; PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1155

be calm and collected as you see I am; PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1156

- now speak.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1157

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Well, then.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1158

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
know what to say to keep him on the tenter-hooks till somebody comes.
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1159

- <bracket> <font> Aloud.  <$$font> <$$bracket> In the first place, my
lord, you must promise you $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} tell any mortal soul
how you came to know it.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1160

<font> Bar. <$$font> Yes, yes, yes - of course, of course.
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1161

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Because it would be the ruin of me, if -
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1162

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ay, ay, ay; PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1163

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be cautious - PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1164

I give you my honour nobody shall know; PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1165

and so, go on, PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1166

$there $'s {TEXT:there's} a good little girl; PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1167

what have you heard or seen?  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1168

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Dear me, I do tremble so!  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1169

- <font> Bar. <$$font> Oh, rot your trembling!
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1170

so do I, with curiosity.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1171

Now speak, PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1172

do.  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1173

<font> Luise.  <$$font> Well, then, my lord, you must know -
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1174

but if you are very, very busy, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} come some other time.
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1175

<font> Bar. <$$font> No, no, no; $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not busy,
PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1176

go on, PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1177

- go on!  PLANCHE-1827-2,36.1178
