Mr. Norton.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.3

<$$heading>

May it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, the noble
prisoner at the bar, George Gordon, Esq. commonly called Lord
George Gordon, stands indicted of high treason, in intending to levy
war against his present Majesty, within the kingdom of Great Britain;
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.5

and Gentlemen {COM:sic_missing_comma} the indictment further states,
that the prisoner to effect this traiterous {COM:sic} intention, did,
on the 2d of June last, and at divers other times, between that day and
the 10th of the same month, at the parish of St. Margaret's within
the liberty of Westminster, in this country, with a great multitude of
persons, armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, with weapons offensive
and defensive, and with colours flying; being then and there unlawfully
and traiterously assembled, most wickedly, maliciously, and traiterously
did prepare and levy publick war against our sovereign Lord the king,
contrary to the duty of his allegiance against the peace of our said
Lord the king, his crown and dignity, and against the statute, in such
case made and provided.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.6

To this indictment the prisoner has pleaded that he is not guilty,
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.7

and hath put himself upon his trial; GORDON-1781-2,1,6.8

we who are of counsel for the crown shall call our witnesses in support
of the prosecution; GORDON-1781-2,1,6.9

and if the evidence shall prove the charge to your satisfaction, then
it will be your duty, under the direction of the court, to find the
prisoner guilty.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.10

<heading>

Mr. Attorney-General.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.12

<$$heading>

May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am also of
counsel in support of this prosecution against the prisoner at the bar,
which imputes to him a crime in the highest class of offences known to
the law of this country - that of High Treason; GORDON-1781-2,1,6.14

and the particular species of high treason you find, from the opening
of the indictment, is levying war against the King within his realm.
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.15

The offence of levying war against the King within the statute of the 25th
of Edward the Third, is of two sorts, the one directly and immediately
against the person of the King, GORDON-1781-2,1,6.16

the other, called constructive levying of war, is against the majesty
of the King, as a great and numerous insurrection of the people to
effect by force an alternation of the established law of the country,
the redress of national grievances, or the reformation of evils, real or
imaginary, in which the insurgents have no particular or special interest.
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.17

It is of the latter kind of levying war with which the prisoner at the
bar stands accused by this indictment.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.18

You, Gentlemen, who reside in this county, are not strangers to the
occasion of this prosecution - GORDON-1781-2,1,6.19

In the latter end of the year 1778, an act of parliament passed to
repeal certain provisions affecting the Roman Catholicks in this country,
contained in an act of parliament made in the eleventh and twelfth year
of the reign of King William the Third.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.20

The particular provisions which it was the object of this act to repeal
were these: GORDON-1781-2,1,6.21

By the statute of King William every Popish priest, exercising any part
of his function in this kingdom, was liable to perpetual imprisonment;
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.22

every person of the Popish religion keeping a school, or taking upon
himself the education, government, or boarding of youth, was liable to
the same punishment.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.23

And by another part of this act, Roman Catholicks were rendered incapable
of inheriting or taking by devise or limitation any estates from
their parents or others, unless they should take oaths and subscribe a
declaration, which by their religion they could not conscientiously do,
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.24

and their estates were to go immediately over to their next of kin
being protestants, and them {COM:sic} and their families left to starve.
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.25

There was another provision too which made them incapable of taking an
estate by purchase.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.26

This act containing such severe penalties could only be justified by the
necessity of the case, for the salvation of the state and our religion.
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.27

It is the height of severity to punish men for serving God in their
own way, or employing themselves in one of the most important duties to
society, the education of youth; GORDON-1781-2,1,6.28

that men shall for these reasons alone be doomed to a loathsome prison
for their lives, and to the perpetual society of the most profligate
and wretched of mankind, is cruel and horrid.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.29

The other part of the act was extremely severe in depriving a man of
his birthright and inheritance.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.30

The history of the time indeed does not furnish any proof of the
necessity, nor afford an apology for the hardship of these provisions;
GORDON-1781-2,1,6.31

an account of the commencement and progress of the act is given by a
very learned divine, who was at that time a member of the House of Peers,
Bishop Burnet.  GORDON-1781-2,1,6.32

It originated in party faction, in opposition to the court <P_1,7>
at that time.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.33

The bill was brought into the House of Commons that the court party might
reject it, and draw upon themselves the odium of a measure in favour of
the Catholicks GORDON-1781-2,1,7.34

for those that brought in the bill did not mean it should pass;
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.35

they were disappointed in their views, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.36

for the court party made no opposition to it.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.37

They then wished to drop it GORDON-1781-2,1,7.38

but they could not; upon which Bishop Burnet says they added very severe
and unreasonable clauses to the bill and sent it up to the House of Lords,
in hopes that that House would reject it; GORDON-1781-2,1,7.39

in this they were disappointed too, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.40

for the House of Lords did not reject the bill, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.41

but suffered it to pass with the severe penalties and punishments I
have stated.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.42

It is too much, in my opinion, for any party or faction to stake upon
their game the liberties and fortunes of others.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.43

The Catholicks submitted to this law, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.44

they expected no doubt, that parliament would see the hardship
imposed upon them by these provisions, and administer redress.
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.45

They made no application, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.46

and indeed the penalties and punishments appeared to every body so
extremely harsh and severe, that very few prosecutions were carried on
upon this act; GORDON-1781-2,1,7.47

in my own time I only remember one, which was against a person for saying
mass in a house somewhere about Wapping; GORDON-1781-2,1,7.48

he was convicted, and of course doomed by the provisions of this act to
perpetual imprisonment.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.49

But the Roman Catholicks were still liable to private extortionary
demands, which they yielded to, to {COM:sic} avoid either prosecution
, or that they might have the liberty of enjoying what had long been
in their families and had descended to them as their birth-right.
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.50

This law remained in the statute book <paren> and though seldom put
in execution was sufficient to occasion perpetual alarm <$$paren> till
the year 1778, when an act of parliament was brought into the House of
Commons to relieve his Majesty's Roman Catholick subjects against the
particular provisions I have stated.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.51

The propriety and justice of that measure, the circumstances attending
it pretty plainly evince.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.52

The bill was brought in by a member of the House of Commons distinguished
for his love of the civil rights of mankind, and for his firm and zealous
attachment to the Protestant religion, and who besides possesses every
publick and private virtue that can adorn the citizen and the man.
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.53

I mean Sir George Savile - GORDON-1781-2,1,7.54

It passed through the House of Commons with almost unamimity,
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.55

the opposition made to it from some was not to the principle of the
bill, but that it did $not {TEXT:no} go far enough in the redress;
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.56

it should in the opinion of those have been extended to other penalites
, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.57

for I must inform you that in the time of passing the act of King William
, the Roman Catholicks stood by law excluded from any share in government
, for any office of trust, civil or military, and the persons of that
religion performing any part of their functions, as priests or keeping
of schools or educating youth, stood liable to many pecuniary penalties,
and in some instances to temporary imprisonments.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.58

This was their situation at the time when these additional penalties
and punishments were inflicted upon them.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.59

This repeal was not absolute and extending to all affected by the statute
of King William GORDON-1781-2,1,7.60

but was conditional, and restrained to those who should take an oath
established, by that act, of the strongest assurance of their loyalty
and affection to the government, and an abjuration in explicit terms
of every pretender to the crown and government of this kingdom, and
besides a positive renunciation of any authority of the see of Rome,
in civil or temporal cases, within this kingdom.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.61

None could receive the benefit of this repeal, who did not give the
public that pledge.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.62

Upon the passing of this act, many of the Roman Catholicks of the first
characters and fortunes in the kingdom, and others of all descriptions,
came in, GORDON-1781-2,1,7.63

and gave the security to government, under the sanction of an oath,
which the act required; GORDON-1781-2,1,7.64

no person at the time seemed dissatified; GORDON-1781-2,1,7.65

but in the winter following it was supposed that a Bill would be brought
into parliament, to take off some penalties which were inflicted
by the laws of Scotland upon the Roman Catholicks of that country.
GORDON-1781-2,1,7.66

And in the beginning of February were received from Edinburgh, and
published in every paper, accounts of a most violent insurrection in
that country, to put a stop to that measure.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.67

It appeared from these accounts that, upon the 2d of February, an
insurrection happened in the city of Edinburgh, the two Roman Catholick
chapels had been attacked and set on fire; that the houses of the
Roman Catholicks there in different parts of the town, were attacked
, ransacked, and demolished; that the utmost exertions of the civil
magistrate, assisted by some of the fencibles, could not suppress the
tumult; not until the provost of the city gave assurances in the most
publick manner, that the scheme was dropped, that no act of parliament
would be applied for, respecting the Roman Catholicks of Scotland,
could any check be given to the violence and outrages committing to the
distruction {COM:sic} of many innocent men.  GORDON-1781-2,1,7.68

This put an end to an attempt to obtain the act of parliament, conceived
by some gentlemen of distinction of that country, to be a very salutary,
<P_1,8> proper, and just measure.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.69

I take notice of this insurrection in Scotland, because when I come to
state to you the conduct of the prisoner at the bar, it will be found
to be a very material circumstance.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.70

Things remained for some time quiet in this country, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.71

but an Association was formed, called the Protestant Association, every
one of you, Gentlemen, have heard of it, and where pains were taken to
create a belief that the repeal of the statute of King William would
be attended with immediate danger to the state, and to the Protestant
religion; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.72

upon that ground it seems a petition was determined upon,
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.73

and if they apprehended danger, they did right to petition;
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.74

it is the inherent right of the subject to petition parliament;
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.75

and whenever they imagine a case proper for the consideration of
parliament, they do right to bring it before them; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.76

and I believe this petition was at one time intended to have
been presented in a legal, constitutional, and orderly manner.
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.77

You will find, for I shall give you the general outlines of the business
before I state the particular conduct of the prisoner, that upon the
2d of June, in consequence of publick advertisements published in the
news papers, and pasted up at the corners of streets, and of hand bills
distributed, there was collected together in St. George's Fields,
a multitude of people, or more properly, a very large army; I believe
consisting <paren> the particulars we may hear from the witnesses
<$$paren> of many thousands - twenty, thirty, or forty thousand - under
the pretext of presenting a petition to parliament, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.78

yet the petitioners are not to dictate to parliament, or take
from parliament their deliberation and judgement upon the subject;
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.79

that would tend directly to the dissolution of the constitution, and
the subversion of government.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.80

This body of men were arranged, according to the direction of the
advertisement, into three or four divisions; the London to the right ,
the Scotch division to the left, and the Westminster to one part, and
the Southwark division in another; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.81

one division, consisting of many many thousands, marched over
London-bridge, through the city, down the Strand, and so to the House
of Commons, with colours flying, distinguished by blue cockades, and
making a march as regular as an army trained to it; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.82

they had bagpipes, which belonged, I fancy, to the Scotch division;
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.83

in this way they marched; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.84

they arrived at the House of Commons about one o'clock;
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.85

and, being joined by the other divisions, took possession of all the
avenues leading to the House, and of the lobby, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.86

and it was with the utmost difficulty the members got admittance into
the house; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.87

some members of each house were insulted and ill-treated by the populace ,
as examples I presume of what the rest were to expect, if the wishes of
the mob were not complied with; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.88

in this situation the petition was presented, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.89

and those in the lobby were desired to withdraw.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.90

If it was a constitutional purpose they had in coming to the house,
it was answered; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.91

but they would not stir, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.92

and with great riot and confusion insisted upon a repeal of the act;
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.93

the cry was A repeal!  A repeal!  No popery.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.94

- The civil power was in vain sent for to disperse them,
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.95

they still kept possession; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.96

they besieged the House, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.97

they kept the members imprisoned.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.98

Thus they continued till between nine and ten at night, when the civil
power, by the assistance of the military, were able to deliver the House
of Commons from the disgraceful situation in which they had been in
{COM:sic_doubled_preposition} to that time, and must have been confined
till they had granted, as far as they could, the prayer of this petition.
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.99

As soon as the house was delivered, they ordered the business to be
considered, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.100

and adjounred to the Tuesday following; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.101

but the mob, not having succeeded in their purpose, and being driven from
the house in the manner I have stated, immediately betook themselves to
other measures; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.102

they instantly resolved to attack the chapels of the foreign ministers,
which, in every civilized country are protected and deemed sacred from
insult; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.103

some of them were apprehended, I think about thirteen, that night or
the next morning.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.104

On Saturday they paraded in different parts of the town,
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.105

but I do not find that much mischief was done: GORDON-1781-2,1,8.106

On the Sunday they appeared in Moorfields, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.107

they there attacked a chapel in that neighborhood, and the houses of
many Roman Catholicks, situated thereabouts, GORDON-1781-2,1,8.108

and completely demolished the houses and effects of these unfortunate
people.  GORDON-1781-2,1,8.109

I only give in general, an account of what they did.
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.110

I am convinced many of you were eye-witnesses to what I am now stating.
GORDON-1781-2,1,8.111

On the Monday, the men who were taken up were examined at Sir John
Fielding's: GORDON-1781-2,1,8.112

five of them were committed to Newgate: GORDON-1781-2,1,8.113

they were examined under the apprehension of a rescue from the violence
that was without the door; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.114

it was with difficulty that they were conducted to Newgate by the Guards
; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.115

but, as soon as they were lodged there, these people made an attack upon
the house of a Mr. Rainsforth, who had been active in apprehending
them, and a witness against them; GORDON-1781-2,1,8.116

they made an attack too upon the <P_1,9> house of a Mr. Maberly,
who had been a witness before the magistrate; and also upon the house
of Sir George Savile; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.117

and they did other injury that night.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.118

The next day, being the Tuesday when the parliament was to meet again,
all the parties of this army re-assembled about the House of Commons,
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.119

and there continued with great riot and confusion, with shouts for
A repeal, and No popery, till the house was obliged to adjourn.
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.120

Upon this their first attack was upon the house of Mr. Hyde;
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.121

the offence given by Mr. Hyde, was partly his attendance at the
justices upon the Monday at the examination, but principally for his
activity as a magistrate in saving the life of a member of the House of
Peers, the Earl of Sandwich, who in going to attend his duty, had been
violently attacked by the mob.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.122

They ransacked and set fire to Mr. Hyde's house,
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.123

and burnt the furniture, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.124

and totally demolished every thing they could.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.125

In this they were accompanied with their colours, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.126

for they appeared again with their flags and with their cockades.
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.127

Very large parts of the mob marched to Newgate; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.128

they set fire to the keeper's house; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.129

they attacked the prison; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.130

and, in a very short time, they set at large all the prisoners;
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.131

a place which for its security seemed to be equal to a prison in the
centre of the earth.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.132

They afterwards attacked and demolished many houses belonging to Roman
Catholicks, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.133

burnt and destroyed the furniture and effects.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.134

Upon the Wednesday they attacked and broke open the other prisons in
and about this metropolis, with an exception of the Poultry Compter,
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.135

and set at liberty all the prisoners; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.136

they continued their proceedings without control or check all that night,
and until some time the next morning; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.137

in that night various houses in different parts of the town were in
flames at the same time; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.138

in short nothing was expected less than general conflagration.
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.139

The next day an attack was meditated upon the Bank, and I believe upon
the Pay and Excise offices, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.140

happily his Majesty by his anxious care, and extraordinary and
unremitting exertions, had been able to collect together a force;
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.141

all the troops within a considerable distance were brought up to the
metropolis, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.142

and they gave a check to the fury of the mob; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.143

this was upon the Thursday, when they were making an attempt upon the
Poultry Compter.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.144

Every person I believe is convinced, that if a stop had not been then
put to the outrages, the whole of this Town would have been destroyed
in a very short time; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.145

for though the repeal of the Bill was the pretended cause, and the Roman
Catholicks the object at first of their violence, that distinction would
soon have vanished - GORDON-1781-2,1,9.146

the reputed papist - the friend of the papist, and those who had not
the least connection with them, if in any respect obnoxious to the mob,
would have suffered - GORDON-1781-2,1,9.147

It is astonishing to me, that the whole town was not destroyed,
considering the number of Roman Catholicks employed in our manufacturies
here, and others who are doomed to the most laborious employments in
this town; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.148

had they interposed in defence of their innocent bretheren to preserve
them from ruin what must have been the consequence!  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.149

- A bloody war must have taken place; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.150

and if an attack upon the houses of protestants had been provoked, the
whole of this town, even before the military could have arrived to our
assistance, might have been destroyed - GORDON-1781-2,1,9.151

Before the insurrection was put an end to there appeared strong marks
of the machinations of our inveterate enemies.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.152

What was the meaning of opening the prisons - GORDON-1781-2,1,9.153

what was the intent of that attack upon the national credit of the
Kingdom, the Bank of England?  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.154

was that upon the ground of Popery, or for the repeal of this Bill?
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.155

Other circumstances concurring, leave no doubt that greater designs than
at first appeared were opening to the Public.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.156

Having stated in general the outlines of the violences committed during
these few days, to the eternal disgrace of this Country, for it can
never be wiped off, it remains for me to state to you, what share the
prisoner at the bar had in them; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.157

for there can be no doubt that all persons who contributed to the
perpetration of them are as criminal as the very persons who committed
the act, and more so, especially, if they are to $be {TEXT:he} ascribed
to their incitement and encouragement.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.158

Gentlemen, you have now before you, as will appear upon the evidence,
the author of all these violent and disgraceful proceedings, to whom
the whole is to be imputed, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.159

an offender of such a description has not often appeared in a court
of justice.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.160

I have already stated to you the Protestant Association,
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.161

but have not mentioned to you, leaving it to this stage of the
business, that the prisoner was the president of that association.
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.162

I stated to you, that I have great reasons to believe, and I hope it will
come out before this day is over, that there were some of that association
who meant no more than to lay their apprehensions before parliament,
willing to leave them to their consideration and judgment, intended to
present their petition in the ordinary form, and in a constitutional way,
attended by very few of the petitioners.  GORDON-1781-2,1,9.163

But that did not square with the view of their president.
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.164

Their president had been in parliament, GORDON-1781-2,1,9.165

- he had observed the sentiments of many upon the subject of this repeal
; GORDON-1781-2,1,9.166

he possibly despaired of any immediate relief being given,
GORDON-1781-2,1,9.167

for <P_1,10> certainly the subject required great consideration;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.168

the circumstances, if any, to shew danger to be apprehended from the
repeal of the Bill were to be investigated.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.169

A difficulty was thrown upon the business; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.170

this Bill invited the Catholicks to give a pledge of their fidelity and
loyalty; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.171

this they had done upon the faith of enjoying that degree of freedom
from penalties and punishments which the act held out to them;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.172

there were besides other weighty considerations.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.173

But deliberate proceedings would not answer the purpose;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.174

the session of parliament was near expiring; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.175

the prisoner at the bar advertized for a general meeting to propose an
attendance on this petition by numbers; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.176

the proposal at a general meeting, where all came that pleased without
distinction, was immediately assented to; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.177

there are people who attend these places who $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
exist without the opportunity of plunder; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.178

the prisoner upon this declared that he would not present the petition
unless he was attended by twenty thousand people; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.179

did such an idea ever strike any man that meant well to the peace and
tranquillity of the country, that he would not present it without he was
attended by twenty thousand people, and they were to be marked, they were
to be distinguished by cockades, that he might know the friends of the
petition or the friends to the protestant cause.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.180

Good God!  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.181

is a cockade the test of adherence to any good cause;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.182

every man that came there with a cockade, whatever his views were, was
considered as a friend to the Protestant religion; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.183

there was no other title to admission into this body, but merely having
cockades in their hats - GORDON-1781-2,1,10.184

Then he gave directions, that they should be formed into divisions;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.185

a general could not make a more proper disposition of his army;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.186

the London division was to go to the right, the Scotch to the
left, Westminster to one part, Southwark to the other part;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.187

and then they were to be marched off in these divisions.
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.188

I dare say it struck many who were there, that this proposal must
be attended with tumult and breaches of the peace at the least;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.189

the very collection of so great a number was never made in any country
without doing mischief; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.190

but to take off apprehensions of that kind, $he {TEXT:be} bid them
recollect what the Scotch had done.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.191

By their firm conduct they had prevented the Bill from extending to them
; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.192

he recommended to this body, to twenty thousand men!  the firm conduct
of the Scotch, which consisted in the most violent insurrection and
tumult that ever was known in that city, and in acts of violence against
the Roman Catholicks who committed no fault, nor applied for redress,
but were taken up as men innocently suffering and men that ought to
be relieved.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.193

Is a mob not able to take the hint?  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.194

it should have been too much for the prisoner to have said, Gentlemen
go GORDON-1781-2,1,10.195

and pull down all the houses of the Roman Catholicks;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.196

the civil magistrates would have interposed; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.197

but it was, Recollect what the Scotch did by their firm conduct;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.198

and he added, he did not desire them to run any danger which he was not
ready to share with them, and that he would meet them there; and was
ready to go to the gallows for their cause; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.199

greater encouragement could not be given to a set of men;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.200

they looked up to him as a man of education and high birth;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.201

they probably did not at that time suspect the snare he was drawing them
into, when he offered and pledged himself, and that he would even go to
the gallows with them in the business; GORDON-1781-2,1,10.202

he published an advertisement for a meeting of these people,
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.203

and though he mentioned only twenty thousand, he had an expectation of
a much larger army.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.204

The advertisement I will read to you, GORDON-1781-2,1,10.205

"Protestant Association.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.206

Whereas no hall in London can contain forty thousand men
, Resolved that this association do meet on Friday next
{COM:sentence_interrupted_and_continued_below}. "GORDON-1781-2,1,10.207

<font> Court.  <$$font> Gentlemen of the Jury.  I observe some of you
are taking notes, GORDON-1781-2,1,10.208

you are not to attend to any thing stated to you by the counsel unless
it is afterwards proved by the witnesses.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.209

Mr. Attorney General.  I open to you from my instructions what
is given me as facts, and where witnesses are put down to prove them;
GORDON-1781-2,1,10.210

I am not answerable for the truth of them, GORDON-1781-2,1,10.211

God forbid that any thing I mention unsupported by proof should turn to
the prejudice of the prisoner at the bar.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.212

The first resolution says,"Resolved that this association do meet on
Friday next, June the 2d, in St. George's Fields, at ten o'clock
in the morning; to consider of the most prudent and respectful manner
of attending their petition, which will be presented the same day to
the House of Commons.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.213

Forty thousand men to meet to consider of the most prudent and respectful
manner of presenting a petition, GORDON-1781-2,1,10.214

how are they to be consulted!  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.215

how is their opinion to be asked!  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.216

this is a disguised business.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.217

-"Resolved, for the sake of good order and regularity, that this
association, on coming to the grounds, do separate themselves into four
divisions; to wit, the London division, the Westminster division, the
Southwark division, and the Scotch division.  GORDON-1781-2,1,10.218

Resolved, that the London division do take place upon the right of the
ground toward Southwark; the Westminster division second; the Southwark
division third; and the Scotch division upon the left; all wearing blue
cockades in their hats to distinguish themselves from the Papists,
and those who approved of the late act in favour of <P_1,11> popery.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,11.219

So every man that did not wear a cockade in his hat was to be
distinguished as a favourer of Popery and of the late act of parliament;
and that every man who would put a cockade in his hat, be his description
what it might, was to be considered as a friend to this petition;
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.220

in short he was to be a friend to the purposes in view.
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.221

"Resolved, that the magistrates of London, Westminster, and Southwark,
are requested to attend, that their presence may over-awe and control
any riotous or evil minded persons who may wish to disturb the
legal and peaceable deportment of his majesty's protestant subjects.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,11.222

- Now, Gentlemen, what an insult is this upon the civil magistrates!
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.223

this last parpagraph adds to the mockery of the advertisement;
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.224

is of a piece with the other I observed upon in the circumstances
of these people calling for a protection from the civil magistrates
against those who should disturb their legal and peaceable deportment;
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.225

for God's sake, who is there that durst look in the face of forty
thousand men!  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.226

this army wants a protection, GORDON-1781-2,1,11.227

and calls upon the magistrates for it; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.228

but what magistrates?  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.229

the London, Westminster, and Southwark; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.230

of the two first none could act but in London and Westminster,
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.231

and in Southwark I believe hardly one magistrate resided,
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.232

and besides these men were out of the Borough of Southwark so that not
one of the magistrates, if called upon to keep the peace, and to protect
forty thousand men, could act at all.  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.233

This advertisement was evidently to disguise the real purpose and views
of the meeting.  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.234

I have already stated to you the assembly the advertisement produced on
the 2d of June; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.235

the prisoner at the bar appeared at their head with his cockade;
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.236

they were drawn up and under orders, I presume, under him.
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.237

Upon a person's carrying a message from the prisoner to them the march
began, that I have already stated to you; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.238

he received them, GORDON-1781-2,1,11.239

or came along with them, I do not know which, to the House of Commons ,
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.240

and there presented the petition.  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.241

This body of men will appear to you to have been totally under his
influence and management; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.242

the insult and violence at the House of Commons, I have already described
to you, and the force used there; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.243

no persuasion whatever, no exertion could deliver the House of
Commons from the situation they were in till very late at night.
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.244

He had it in his power at any moment to have done it,
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.245

nay in the height of the tumult those in the lobby called to him to know
whether they should quit the lobby; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.246

it was impossible to have a division until the lobby was cleared,
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.247

but nothing could be done without his directions; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.248

it was not safe for him to order them to stay and obstruct the proceedings
of the House in plain terms; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.249

but he did that which was equivalent; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.250

he told them to be steady and persevere; that he would state to them
the case; that he had called for a division, that there was no doubt
at all that it was against them, but, if they continued in the lobby,
the house could not divide; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.251

this he stated to them, not that he advised them; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.252

and then that he might not appear to have given them any directions,
he left it to them to do as they pleased; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.253

it was enough to leave to them that by clearing the lobby the business
would be put off, whereas they wanted it to be instantly urged on,
and carried through; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.254

he was applied to over and over to desire them to go out;
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.255

a word from him would have done it, GORDON-1781-2,1,11.256

and then parliament would not have been compelled to suffer the disgrace
of passing an act without examination, and without forming a judgement
upon the subject.  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.257

Gentlemen, you will find that he reminded them over and over of the
conduct of the Scotch; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.258

he told them the civil magistrate was sent for, but they need not regard
him, for he believed he was a petitioner; that the Guards, if they came,
would do them no hurt; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.259

in short, by his persuasions and incitement, he kept that body at the
door, imprisoning the members.  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.260

When the Scotch, said he, pulled down the mass-houses, they had redress.
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.261

Lord Weymouth sent an assurance that the bill should not be extended to
Scotland, GORDON-1781-2,1,11.262

and shall the Scotch be better than you?  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.263

No language could convey more intelligible directions to these people;
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.264

if they did not succeed by the force upon the House of Commons, they
were to resort to the other plan; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.265

the Scotch, said he, had redress when they pulled down the mass-houses ,
GORDON-1781-2,1,11.266

you know what the Scotch did by their firm conduct; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.267

this he said to them who were under his influence and command; men who
would have departed if he had given them the word; who looked to him
solely for instructions for their conduct, GORDON-1781-2,1,11.268

and besides he mentioned too that there was no doubt that his majesty,
when he heard of the insurrections within ten miles of London, and of
their flocking up to town, would send his ministers to promise a repeal
: GORDON-1781-2,1,11.269

if the prisoner and his adherents were not able to accomplish their
purposes at the House, the Scotch plan he had recommended was to be
adopted; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.270

they $instantly {TEXT:instanty} flew to the chapels of the ambassadors,
afterwards to the houses of the Roman Catholicks, and of those who had
given obstruction to the mob.  GORDON-1781-2,1,11.271

What became of the prisoner does not appear; GORDON-1781-2,1,11.272

but you will find when they re-assembled again upon the Tuesday, after
the violent outrages on the preceding evening, Sunday and Monday, he
came to the House of Commons, with the same symbol of being their head
and leader, that of a cockade, and which <P_1,12> was a plain token of
his approbation of their actions.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.273

They had all their colours flying about Palace Yard.
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.274

- Without remorse, without advising them to depart peaceably, without
remonstrating with them about the mischiefs they had done; he was led
off in triumph through the city of London to the Mansion-house, and
other places, by a large body; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.275

this happened upon the Tuesday.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.276

On the Wednesday he sent an advertisement to the papers of a very singular
nature to be inserted in the Thursday's papers, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.277

it did get into some papers, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.278

it is this; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.279

-"Lord George Gordon went in person to three different places, where
the tumults were subsisting, to harangue the mob, and exhort them to a
peaceable and legal deportment; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.280

he stood for a considerable time among parties of foot soldiers,
accompanied by one of the London sheriffs, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.281

but all this was without effect Lord George Gordon not being able
to give them any assurances that the act would be repealed. "
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.282

This advertisement held out to the mob, that they were to look forward
to some assurances; that they were to continue their depredations till
some assurance should be given, and that this was the only reason why
the violences were not stopped.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.283

Did he flatter himself that he should have assurance from any quarter
that this bill would be repealed!  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.284

He adds, several merchants requested Lord George Gordon to sign
papers that they were friends to the Protestant interest, &c.
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.285

So he states himself in his own hand-writing, that he was the
person who had been, and was to be applied to, for protections;
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.286

we shall shew you one of his protections granted upon the Wednesday,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.287

but nothing carries with it stronger evidence, under his own hand ,
that all the world looked upon him as the only person who had the
government of the mob, in the depredations they were then committing;
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.288

he does not say I refused them, or that I granted them,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.289

he certainly meant that others should apply in the same way for
protections, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.290

it was to demonstrate that he was, and was looked upon to be the only
man whose name and signature would protect them from the violence of
this mob; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.291

his name did furnish a protection in one case which we shall give in
evidence; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.292

he gave a protection to a person who had a Roman Catholick tenant or
lodger in his house - GORDON-1781-2,1,12.293

he found his house had been threatened GORDON-1781-2,1,12.294

and applied to the prisoner for a protection - GORDON-1781-2,1,12.295

he got one GORDON-1781-2,1,12.296

and experienced the benefit of it.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.297

Can any body doubt, after this evidence, that the prisoner at the bar
was not the author of these disturbances, and that to his encouragement,
incitement, and means, they are to be ascribed.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.298

Perhaps he will tell us, he had no other object but the repeal of this
bill; and that if other views, or a more alarming and extensive nature
, mixed in the operations of the mob, they are not imputable to him;
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.299

but if he had no other object than the repeal of this bill, sure, his
measure of guilt is of no ordinary size; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.300

will it be enough for him to say, I would have checked the mob in the
violence of their proceedings, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.301

but I was not able to do it; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.302

that will be no excuse, if he exhorted them to begin, and look to that
as the means to procure a repeal.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.303

If he has turned out upon the public, this many headed monster, to ravage
and destroy, it will be no excuse, to say, I wanted to check its rage
and fury!  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.304

he has designedly given birth to the outrage, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.305

and must stand by the consequences, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.306

it is just he should.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.307

Gentlemen, if these facts are proved, lay your hands upon your hearts ,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.308

and ask yourselves, whether to the prisoner, all that was done, is not
to be imputed.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.309

It is not an accidental assistance, or encouragement,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.310

but he is the contriver of the whole.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.311

If you are satisfied of this, you will pronounce him guilty,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.312

and your verdict will teach the present and future ages this lesson, that
no man, however exalted in birth, situation, or connexion, can violate
the peace, the order, the government, and the laws of his country,
with impunity.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.313

I shall, in order to prove the case, call some witnesses, not so many,
I hope, as you may have seen in a list, which, by some means, has been
published; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.314

it is not the object I know, of delivering lists of witnesses, that they
should appear in the public news-papers, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.315

but you have seen a great many in a list of witnesses published -
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.316

the necessity of putting down many will be obvious to you,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.317

for we had no power over the witnesses at the time their names were
inserted, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.318

several are to the same fact, that if any, from accident, sickness,
or any other cause, could not attend, others, in that list, might be
called, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.319

for we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} supply their {TEXT:there} place by
witnesses not named in the list; GORDON-1781-2,1,12.320

it is therefore of necessity, that we have inserted so many witnesses
to the same transaction, GORDON-1781-2,1,12.321

but I shall not trouble you with more than I think sufficient to establish
the facts.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.322

Gentlemen, I beg pardon for taking up so much of your time,
GORDON-1781-2,1,12.323

but in a cause of such importance and expectation, it becomes my duty
to be as particular in the state of the facts, materially affecting the
prisoner, as it is in my power to do.  GORDON-1781-2,1,12.324

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know the prisoner Lord George Gordon?
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.333

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.334

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember seeing him at any time at
Coachmaker's-Hall?  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.335

<font> A. <$$font> I saw the prisoner at Coachmaker's-Hall on
the 7th of January, 1780.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.336

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see him at different times at that
meeting between the 7th of January and the 2d of June, the day the
multitude went to the House of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.337

<font> A. <$$font> Five or six times, GORDON-1781-2,1,13.338

but not at that place, GORDON-1781-2,1,13.339

the association - GORDON-1781-2,1,13.340

<font> Q. <$$font> What association?  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.341

<font> A. <$$font> The association called the Protestant
Association; was adjourned from place to place.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.342

It was adjourned to Greenwood's Rooms, in the Hay market; to the Old Crown
and Rolls, in Chancery lane; to the London Tavern, in Bishopsgate-street;
and to St. Margaret's-Hall, in the Borough of Southwark.
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.343

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the prisoner at all or at any of
those places?  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.344

<font> A. <$$font> Not at all but at most of them.
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.345

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect which of them you saw him at?
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.346

<font> A. <$$font> I saw him at St. Margaret's-Hall, at
Greenwood's rooms, at the Old Crown and Rolls Tavern, Chancery-lane,
and at Coachmaker's-Hall.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.347

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember seeing him at Coachmaker's-Hall
, at the last meeting, previous to their going up to the House of Commons?
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.348

<font> A. <$$font> I remember it very well.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.349

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect at that time any thing said
by the prisoner, GORDON-1781-2,1,13.350

and if you do, mention what it was?  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.351

<font> A. <$$font> It was on the 29th of May I heard the prisoner
announce to a very numerous assembly, the Hall was crowded,"That the
associated Protestants <paren> as they were called <$$paren> amounted
to upwards of forty thousand in number; that on Friday the 2d of June
it was resolved, they should meet, at ten o'clock in the morning,
in St. George's-fields, in four separate divisions or columns,
arrayed or dressed in their best clothes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.352

<font> Mr. Kenyon.  <$$font> Was it arrayed or dressed?
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.353

A. I think his words were,"to have your best clothes on, with
blue cockades in your hats, as he himself should wear a blue cockade,
to distinguish them from other people who were Papists or friends to
Roman Catholicks. "GORDON-1781-2,1,13.354

His lordship gave orders how these four different bodies should take their
ground, and what fields they should assemble in.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.355

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} charge my memory exactly with the positions
of those four columns, GORDON-1781-2,1,13.356

but I think the London division were to go to the field on the right of
the road.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.357

<font> Court.  <$$font> Do you at all recollect the order?
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.358

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} charge my memory.
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.359

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any thing you heard said by
the prisoner?  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.360

<font> A. <$$font> Not that evening; GORDON-1781-2,1,13.361

but I recollect some evenings before, at the Crown and Rolls, Lord
George Gordon being present, his lordship read over the preambles or
certain parts of penal laws of Charles the Second, William and Mary,
and George the Second.  GORDON-1781-2,1,13.362

After reading those acts, he observed,"That by his Majesty's giving his
assent to the Quebeck law, and the late act of parliament tolerating the
Roman Catholicks in England, his counsellors had brought him to that
pass or situation in which James the Second was after his abdication.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,13.363

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> Were those his lordship's words?
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.364

<font> A. <$$font> As nearly as I can recollect.
GORDON-1781-2,1,13.365

- He then read his Majesty's coronation oath, GORDON-1781-2,1,13.366

and said"It was his opinion, that his Majesty had broken that oath.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,13.367

He observed, that"the people in his country did not mince the matter,
they spoke out, or spoke their minds freely, and avowed it to be true,
"GORDON-1781-2,1,13.368

<P_1,14>

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember any thing else?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.370

<font> A. <$$font> I do not recollect any thing else;
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.371

these are the most emphatical expressions I can charge my memory with.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.372

<font> Q. <$$font> You do not recollect, at present, any
other inflammatory expressions made use of by Lord George Gordon,
either at Coachmaker's-Hall, or any of the preceding meetings?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.373

<font> A. <$$font> None.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.374

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you go to the meeting in St.
George's-Fields on the 2d of June?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.375

<font> A. <$$font> I went there, GORDON-1781-2,1,14.376

but did not mix among the people.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.377

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see a multitude of people gathered
together there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.378

<font> A. <$$font> A vast multitude.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.379

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> What number do you imagine there
might be?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.380

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell;
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.381

I had never seen so many together before, GORDON-1781-2,1,14.382

and could not make a calculation.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.383

<font> Q. <$$font> Had they any particular marks or badges?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.384

<font> A. <$$font> They had all cockades, GORDON-1781-2,1,14.385

and there were banners.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.386

<font> Q. <$$font> Was any thing written upon the banners or
the cockades?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.387

<font> A. <$$font> Nothing on the cockades that I observed.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.388

On the banners I think I saw <font> Protestant Association <$$font>
; GORDON-1781-2,1,14.389

and one banner I believe had <font> No Popery!  <$$font> on it.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.390

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the prisoner there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.391

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  I saw him at a great distance;
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.392

he was going off the field then towards the House of Commons.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.393

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear him address himself to this
multitude?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.394

<font> A. <$$font> I could see Lord George Gordon was haranguing
the people, GORDON-1781-2,1,14.395

but I was not near enough to hear what he said.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.396

<font> Q. <$$font> Which way did this multitude march?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.397

<font> A. <$$font> I can say nothing of their marching, further
than what I saw in Fleet-street.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.398

I came home GORDON-1781-2,1,14.399

and saw them come through Fleet-street, and march by St. Dunstan's
church, in their way to the House of Commons.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.400

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there a large number came that way?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.401

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.402

<font> Q. <$$font> Had they the same cockades and banners?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.403

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, the same cockades, and one or two of
the banners.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.404

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you afterwards on that day come down
towards the House of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.405

<font> A. <$$font> I did.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.406

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see a number of the same people about
the House?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.407

<font> A. <$$font> I did; GORDON-1781-2,1,14.408

they appeared to be the same people.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.409

<font> Q. <$$font> Had they the same cockades and banners?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.410

<font> A. <$$font> Yes they had.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.411

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you get into the lobby of the House
of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.412

<font> A. <$$font> I was there about three hours.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.413

<font> Q. <$$font> Was that filled with some of this multitude?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.414

<font> A. <$$font> The lobby was crowded with them.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.415

<font> Q. <$$font> What was their behaviour?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.416

<font> A. <$$font> Very riotous.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.417

The noise was generally occasioned by <font> chiming <$$font> of Lord
George Gordon's name.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.418

- Lord George Gordon's name was the constant <font> chime.  <$$font>
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.419

The great noise appeared to me to be made by those words <font> Lord
George Gordon.  <$$font> GORDON-1781-2,1,14.420

{TEXT:missing_"Q."} Do you recollect their calling out at all to
any of the members of the House of Commons who were in the lobby.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.421

<font> A. <$$font> I remember two or three members coming
into the gallery over the lobby of the House and speaking to them.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.422

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you remember the mob crying out to the
people in the lobby?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.423

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} pretend to say,
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.424

there was such great confusion and noise.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.425

<font> Q. <$$font> While these people were in the lobby, and you
was there, did you see Lord George Gordon?  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.426

<font> A. <$$font> I saw my Lord George Gordon once in the place
over the lobby.  GORDON-1781-2,1,14.427

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear him say any thing at that time?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.428

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  He exhorted them,"To continue
steadfastly to adhere to so good and glorious a cause as their's was.
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.429

He promised he would persevere in it himself, GORDON-1781-2,1,14.430

and he hoped, although there was very little expectation from the House
of Commons, that they would meet with redress from their mild or gracious
sovereign. "GORDON-1781-2,1,14.431

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you recollect any thing else in particular?
GORDON-1781-2,1,14.432

<P_1,15>

A. I think that is the substance of every thing I heard his
Lordship say; GORDON-1781-2,1,15.434

I have repeated all the words that I thoroughly remember.
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.435

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> Are you thoroughly satisfied that you
have repeated the words of Lord George Gordon?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.436

A. I am.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.437

Q. Do you recollect seeing any flags at any other place in the
course of the mischief which followed?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.438

A. I saw one of the flags at the burning of the Fleet-prison;
that flag which had the words <font> No popery!  <$$font> on it.
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.439

Q. Could you perceive whether the person who had the flag at
the Fleet prison, was one you had seen in St. George's fields,
or about the House of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.440

A. I am very clear it was the same man, GORDON-1781-2,1,15.441

for I looked at him.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.442

Q. Where was it you had before seen that man, you saw with the
flag at the Fleet prison?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.443

A. I saw him carrying that flag in Fleet-street.
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.444

Q. Do you mean at the time when the multitude marched to the
House of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.445

A. Yes; and I saw that very man at Westminster.
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.446

Q. It was on Friday the multitude were here; GORDON-1781-2,1,15.447

were you at either the Sardinian or Bavarian Ambassador's chapels?
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.448

A. I was at that chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-fields?  {COM:sic}
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.449

Q. At what time on Friday night was you there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.450

A. I think it was about ten o'clock.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.451

Q. Did you see any mischief done there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.452

A. A great deal.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.453

I was astonished at the cruelty of what I saw.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.454

Q. What was the cry of the people who were employed in that
business?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.455

A. It generally was, <font> No Popery!  <$$font>
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.456

Q. Had the persons that were doing that mischief blue cockades
in their hats?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.457

A. I did not see a single cockade in the chapel;
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.458

I saw many with blue cockades before I got into the chapel, in the same
street, Duke-street.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.459

Q. Did those persons form a part of the same mob that did the
mischief?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.460

A. They seemed to be by-standers, GORDON-1781-2,1,15.461

they stood encouraging them.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.462

Q. Did the people with blue cockades join with the people who
were crying <font> No popery?  <$$font> GORDON-1781-2,1,15.463

A. It was while I was within the chapel, I heard the cry without
the chapel.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.464

The person who did all the mischief, whom I saw in the chapel, had no
hat on; GORDON-1781-2,1,15.465

there were about five or six people in the chapel, GORDON-1781-2,1,15.466

but that man was the most active.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.467

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> You say those that did the mischief,
had no cockades in their hats?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.468

A. I did not see them have any.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.469

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> You said those that had cockades
encouraged them; GORDON-1781-2,1,15.470

what do you mean by encouraging them?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.471

A. The same as at all the fires; GORDON-1781-2,1,15.472

they stood by GORDON-1781-2,1,15.473

and protected and encouraged them.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.474

Q. Were you present at any other fires, or the demolition of any
other houses?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.475

A. I was present at several of the fires.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.476

Q. Were you present at Mr. Langdale's?
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.477

A. I stood there about a quarter of an hour, GORDON-1781-2,1,15.478

I do not recollect the exact day, GORDON-1781-2,1,15.479

but it was the same day of the fire at the King's Bench, and the fire
at the Fleet Market, the Fleet prison.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.480

Q. did the same cry prevail there of <font> No popery?  <$$font>
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.481

A. The very same, GORDON-1781-2,1,15.482

that was obvious to every body.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.483

Q. Do you recollect being present at any other fire?
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.484

A. Yes, at a public house the corner of Lincoln-Inn-fields;
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.485

they brought the furniture out GORDON-1781-2,1,15.486

and burnt it.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.487

Q. Do you recollect any other?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.488

A. Yes I saw another house demolished in Great Queen-street,
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.489

but I do not know whose house it was.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.490

<heading> William Hay <font> Cross-examined by Mr. <$$font> Kenyon.
<$$heading> GORDON-1781-2,1,15.491

<font> Q. <$$font> Pray what are you?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.492

<font> A. <$$font> By trade, a printer.  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.493

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you print on your own account,
GORDON-1781-2,1,15.494

or are you a servant to any person?  GORDON-1781-2,1,15.495

<P_1,16>

<font> A. <$$font> I print on my own account.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.497

<font> Q. <$$font> I believe you have had misfortunes in the
world, GORDON-1781-2,1,16.498

you were a bankrupt?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.499

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.500

<font> Q. <$$font> When did you first resort to these
meetings of the Protestant Association as they called themselves?
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.501

<font> A. <$$font> I said on the evening of the 10th of December.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.502

<font> Q. <$$font> Was that the first time?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.503

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.504

<font> Q. <$$font> And you went, from time to time, to all the
meetings that were held afterwards?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.505

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, to the publick meetings.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.506

<font> Q. <$$font> You were at several places where Lord George
Gordon did not attend?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.507

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.508

<font> Q. <$$font> You have mentioned one place where Lord George
Gordon was, at Greenwood's Rooms; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.509

now I desire you to recollect, and say, whether you saw him at Greenwood's
Rooms?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.510

<font> A. <$$font> I think I saw my Lord once there,
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.511

and I was there once when he was not; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.512

I was there twice.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.513

<font> Q. <$$font> I caution you to be upon your guard?  {COM:sic}
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.514

<font> A. <$$font> I will; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.515

it is a very serious matter; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.516

I think Lord George was once at Greenwood's Rooms, and that the
association was there once without his lordship.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.517

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} speak with
certainty?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.518

<font> A. <$$font> Unless I look at some notes I $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} tell; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.519

I have some notes here.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.520

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you make them at the time?
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.521

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, I generally made them that evening.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.522

<font> Court.  <$$font> You may refresh your memory with them.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.523

<font> <paren> Looks at his notes.  <$$paren> <$$font>
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.524

<font> A. <$$font> On the 21st of January, Lord George Gordon was
not, I find, present at Green-wood's?  {COM:sic} GORDON-1781-2,1,16.525

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you was mistaken in that part of your
evidence?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.526

<font> A. <$$font> I was mistaken.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.527

<font> Q. <$$font> How came you, from time to time, to make notes
of what passed at these several meetings?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.528

<font> A. <$$font> I shall be very free in telling you, that I
had an idea then, that this would be the consequence of these meetings ,
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.529

I went almost purposely to take notes of them.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.530

<font> Q. <$$font> And you went on that account to take notes of
what passed?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.531

<font> A. <$$font> A curiosity at first led me there,
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.532

but when I saw what sort of people they were, I was willing to look
farther after them, GORDON-1781-2,1,16.533

for I dreaded the consequence of their meetings?  {COM:sic}
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.534

<font> Q. <$$font> How soon had you this foresight of what
would happen.  {COM:sic} GORDON-1781-2,1,16.535

In the month of December you foresaw what would happen?
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.536

<font> A. <$$font> I did not, GORDON-1781-2,1,16.537

I said no such thing; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.538

I foresaw it on the 20th of February.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.539

<font> Q. <$$font> Then the first time you foresaw it was on the
20th of February?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.540

<font> A. <$$font> I had foreseen the evil consequences, as far
as man could, before that time, GORDON-1781-2,1,16.541

but on the 20th of February I had even written my thoughts upon it.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.542

<font> Q. <$$font> Then the 20th of February was the first time
you began to draw your conclusions?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.543

<font> A. <$$font> It was.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.544

<font> Q. <$$font> Then how came your notes and memorandums to
have a date prior to that, GORDON-1781-2,1,16.545

you have notes so early as the 21st of January?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.546

<font> A. <$$font> Without those notes, I could not come to that
conclusion in my own mind about the consequences; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.547

I took notes on the 10th of December.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.548

<font> Q. <$$font> I must return again to the question I asked
before; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.549

how came you first to take notes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.550

Q. I never go to any publick meeting but I have an errand;
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.551

I wished to learn what those gentlemen would be at; GORDON-1781-2,1,16.552

I put down then what occurred, GORDON-1781-2,1,16.553

and then entered it down after I came home.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.554

Q. That is your constant course in all occurrences of life?
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.555

A. Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.556

Q. Can you tell us any one occurrence of your life, where you
have committed to writing every thing that passed?  GORDON-1781-2,1,16.557

A. I do not know any one meeting of that kind,
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.558

but I have put down as much as my memory would help me to.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.559

Q. How many meetings of this kind have you resorted to?
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.560

A. I never resorted to any others of this kind.
GORDON-1781-2,1,16.561

Q. You said you never attended any meetings respecting this kind
of business; where <P_1,17> you did not commit to writing what passed;
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.562

now I want to know, what other meetings besides the Protestant Association
you have attended?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.563

A. I have attended a great many meetings, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.564

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} pretend to recite them.
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.565

Q. Have, you upon your oath, before God and your Country, put
down every thing that passed at those meetings?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.566

A. I do not comprehend the nature of your question.
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.567

Q. Have you set down any transactions at any other meetings,
except those of the Protestant Association?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.568

A. I have many times undoubtedly.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.569

Q. Tell me when and where?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.570

A. The first notes I made in my life, were in the general assembly
of the church of Scotland, the very first church I was ever in, in
my life.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.571

Q. How long is that ago?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.572

A. Twenty two years ago; GORDON-1781-2,1,17.573

so early as that, and in 1765 and 1766, I took notes again.
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.574

Q. Did you do that because you had a foresight of any ill
consequences that would ensue from those meetings?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.575

A. I wished to know what was going on there, or to oblige a friend
to inform him what was doing.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.576

Q. You were not only at meetings of the Protestant Association
that were advertised, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.577

but happened likewise to be casually at the chapel in Duke-street,
at Mr. Langdale's, at a house-burning in Lincoln-Inn-fields
, at a house-burning in Great Queen-street, and at Newgate?
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.578

A. The first you mention, was the burning the Roman Catholick
chapel.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.579

I was coming home; GORDON-1781-2,1,17.580

a young gentleman was with me.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.581

Q. Tell me his name.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.582

A. M'Millan, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.583

he is here.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.584

Q. Where did you meet with him?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.585

A. I met with him accidentally; GORDON-1781-2,1,17.586

when we had notice they were demolishing the chapel, we were I think
coming by Covent Garden, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.587

and we directed our course there.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.588

Q. Coming home from whence?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.589

A. From Westminster.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.590

Q. From the lobby I suppose?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.591

A. Very likely so.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.592

Q. At the time when you was in St. George's-fields had
you a blue cockade in your hat?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.593

A. I never had in my life.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.594

Q. You say you was in the lobby of the House of Commons?
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.595

A. I was.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.596

Q. Did you go into the lobby with persons who had blue cockades
in their hats?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.597

A. They were all there long before me.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.598

I went down after I had dined.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.599

Q. Being crowded, and the place being full, still there was room
for you to get in?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.600

A. Scarcely.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.601

I went in with Alderman Sawbridge.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.602

Q. What hour did you get there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.603

A. At six or seven o'clock, I believe.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.604

Q. When did you leave the lobby?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.605

A. At nine o'clock; GORDON-1781-2,1,17.606

I looked at my watch when I came out, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.607

it was nine or perhaps ten minutes after nine.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.608

Q. You say, at the time you was in the lobby, there was a
great riot and confusion, and you could not hear what passed there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.609

A. I heard exceeding well, too well what passed there,
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.610

there was a great noise, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.611

I heard Lord George Gordon's name pronounced vociferously.
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.612

Q. The lobby is not a very large room.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.613

Were there a good number of people of the same description as yourself,
that were there merely from curiosity?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.614

A. I saw none such, GORDON-1781-2,1,17.615

it did not come from curiosity.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.616

Q. Then you was the single individual, that stood distinguished
from all the rest, who were there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.617

Q. There were more than I there; GORDON-1781-2,1,17.618

there was that man M'Millan, and an apprentice of my own,
GORDON-1781-2,1,17.619

I took them on purpose with me.  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.620

Q. That they might be of what use?  GORDON-1781-2,1,17.621

<P_1,18>

A. I wanted to enquire after some particular friends;
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.623

I was afraid they might be hurt, GORDON-1781-2,1,18.624

I was afraid of myself.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.625

Q. Being afraid of yourself, you who were not in the crowd before ,
nor in danger of being hurt, under ideas you might be hurt you went into
the crowd in the lobby?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.626

A. I was willing to see what they were about.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.627

Q. Which of your friends did you conceive to be in danger?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.628

A. When an alarm of that kind is gone out, one $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} but have some friend in danger; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.629

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} charge my memory with any particular friend.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.630

Q. You said Lord George Gordon desired they would meet at ten
in the morning, and put on their best clothes, or, as you choose to
introduce it in your discourse, to be arrayed in their best clothes,
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.631

which was the word as far as you can recollect?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.632

A. I think it was,"be sure to be <font> in <$$font> your
best clothes, or be <font> dressed <$$font> in your best clothes.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,18.633

Q. He gave orders they should be in four what -?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.634

A. Divisions.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.635

Q. <font> Columns <$$font> you called them?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.636

A. I said columns or divisions.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.637

Q. In St. George's-fields you were a considerable distance
from Lord George; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.638

how near were you to the persons who carried the two flags?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.639

A. I saw one of the flags carried by a constable on my left hand
; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.640

I was in the road; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.641

I did not go into the field.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.642

Q. The persons who carried the flags were I suppose surrounded
by the rest of the multitude?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.643

A. No; they were not surrounded; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.644

I remember the London division marching round, GORDON-1781-2,1,18.645

and the flags were carried but not surrounded; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.646

I saw them pass.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.647

The flag was in the front of them.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.648

Q. Did you accompany the London division over the bridge?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.649

A. No; I came over Blackfriars bridge, GORDON-1781-2,1,18.650

and went home directly.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.651

Q. About what hour was that?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.652

A. About two o'clock.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.653

Q. At what hour did you leave your house to go down to the House
of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.654

A. I will not positively swear to that, GORDON-1781-2,1,18.655

it was between five and six o'clock.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.656

Q. And you went down immediately to the lobby of the House
of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.657

A. I was there between six and seven o'clock.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.658

<font> Q. <$$font> Then all the people that had passed by were in
the avenues of the House of Commons before this?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.659

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.660

<font> Q. <$$font> By what good luck then did you happen to see
the flag in Fleet-street.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.661

- Where is your house?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.662

<font> A. <$$font> Next St. Dunstan's Church;
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.663

I went upon the leads on purpose to see them with this Mr.
M'Millan.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.664

<font> Q. <$$font> One of the persons you saw with a flag in
Fleet-street you saw afterwards?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.665

A. Yes; at the Fleet-prison and in Westminster.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.666

<font> Q. <$$font> Can you describe his dress?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.667

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} charge my memory;
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.668

it was a dress not worth minding, a very common dress.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.669

<font> Q. <$$font> Had he his own hair or a wig?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.670

<font> A. <$$font> If I recollect he had black hair; shortish
hair I think.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.671

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there something remarkable about his hair?
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.672

<font> A. <$$font> No; I do not remember any thing remarkable;
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.673

he was a coarse looking man; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.674

he appeared to me like a brewer's servant in his best clothes.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.675

<font> Q. <$$font> How do you know a brewer's servant when he is
in his best clothes from another man?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.676

<font> A. <$$font> It is out of my power to describe it better
than I do; GORDON-1781-2,1,18.677

he appeared to me to be such.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.678

<font> Q. <$$font> I ask you how, by what mark, do you distinguish
a brewer's servant from another man?  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.679

<font> A. <$$font> There is something in a brewer's servant, in
his condition of life, different from other men.  GORDON-1781-2,1,18.680

<font> Q. <$$font> There may be for what I know;
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.681

but tell me how you distinguish a brewer's servant from another man.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.682

<font> A. <$$font> Be so good as to state the question again.
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.683

<font> Q. <$$font> If there can be a doubt what the question
means in any one of this audience you shall have it repeated;
GORDON-1781-2,1,18.684

you said this man was like a brewer's servant, GORDON-1781-2,1,18.685

I asked you by what <P_1,19> mark you are able to distinguish a man to be
a brewer's servant rather than of any other trade?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.686

<font> A. <$$font> I think a brewer's servant's breeches , clothes,
and stockings have something very distinguishing.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.687

<font> Q. <$$font> Tell me what in his breeches, and the cut
of his coat and stockings it was by which you distinguished him?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.688

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} swear to any
particular mark.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.689

<font> Q. <$$font> Then you had no reason upon earth to use
that word which came so flippant over your tongue that he was like a
brewer's servant?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.690

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} answer that question
if you put it to me a hundred times.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.691

<font> Q. <$$font> You said that one of the persons who carried
one of the flags in St. George's-fields was a constable?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.692

<font> A. <$$font> Yes; I said so.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.693

<font> Q. <$$font> How do you know he was a constable?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.694

<font> A. <$$font> The man was very remarkable;
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.695

his name is Payne, GORDON-1781-2,1,19.696

he is a city constable.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.697

Q. Are you of the Kirk of Scotland or a Roman Catholick?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.698

<font> A. <$$font> I am of the Church of England.
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.699

<font> Q. <$$font> How came you to stay so long in the lobby of
the House of Commons?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.700

<font> A. <$$font> I wished to see an end to it.
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.701

<font> Q. <$$font> At what time did you see Lord George Gordon
in the Balcony?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.702

A. I heard him GORDON-1781-2,1,19.703

and saw him once; GORDON-1781-2,1,19.704

he was twice I think in the balcony while I was in the lobby.
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.705

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you inform the Secretaries of State or any
civil magistrate of your apprehensions in February of what would happen?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.706

A. Yes; I did communicate my fears then.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.707

<font> Q. <$$font> To whom?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.708

A. A gentleman; GORDON-1781-2,1,19.709

I would rather not mention the gentleman's name.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.710

<font> Q. <$$font> But you must do it?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.711

A. I wrote my sentiments of these matters to a very particular
friend, my sentiments of this association meeting.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.712

<font> Q. <$$font> You are asked who that particular friend is?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.713

A. Mr. Butler of Lincoln's Inn.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.714

<font> Q. <$$font> Mr. Butler is a gentleman I have likewise
the honour of knowing; GORDON-1781-2,1,19.715

Mr. Butler is I understand a Roman Catholick?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.716

A. I never asked him the question.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.717

<font> Q. <$$font> If he is your particular friend have you any
doubt about it?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.718

A. I have heard he is a Roman Catholick, GORDON-1781-2,1,19.719

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know that he is; GORDON-1781-2,1,19.720

I have a very high opinion of him.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.721

<font> Q. <$$font> So have I; GORDON-1781-2,1,19.722

but have you the least doubt of his being a Roman Catholick.
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.723

A. I have heard he is.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.724

I will not answer the question because I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know it.
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.725

<font> Q. <$$font> On what day?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.733

A. I really do not know what day it was, farther than it was
the day when the meeting in St. George's-fields was fixed on.
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.734

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see Lord George Gordon there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.735

A. I did.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.736

<font> Q. <$$font> What number of people might be at
Coachmaker's-hall?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.737

A. I am not able to judge what number of people there were,
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.738

but the hall was so full that I could not get in.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.739

Q. Did you learn what the purpose of the meeting was; by what
was going forwards there.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.740

A. I did not at that time; GORDON-1781-2,1,19.741

no farther than it was a meeting where Lord George Gordon was to be,
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.742

and I went there merely out of curiosity.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.743

<font> Q. <$$font> Recollect yourself GORDON-1781-2,1,19.744

and inform the Court what passed during the time you was there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.745

A. I went to a gentleman who had some knowledge of the person
who I believe lives at the Hall, GORDON-1781-2,1,19.746

and by his means I got into the gallery.  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.747

<font> Q <$$font> Relate what passed there, particularly what fell from
Lord George Gordon himself?  GORDON-1781-2,1,19.748

A. Lord George Gordon was speaking at the time I went in;
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.749

I heard him desire them to meet him in St. George's Fields;
GORDON-1781-2,1,19.750

he reminded them"that the Scotch had <P_1,20> succeeded by unanimity,
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.751

and he desired that they would likewise be unanimous;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.752

he hoped no one who had signed the petition would be ashamed or afraid
to shew himself in the cause; that he would not present the petition,
or that he begged leave to decline it <paren> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
attempt to use his lordship's words, it is impossible <$$paren> unless
he was met in St. George's-fields by twenty thousand people;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.753

and he recommended to them to come with some mark of distinction such
as a blue ribband in their hats,"or words to that effect;" that they
might be able to distinguish their friends from their foes, "or to that
purport; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.754

"that he himself would be there to meet them, and would be
answerable for any of them that should be molested for meeting there;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.755

that he wished so well to the cause that he would go to the gallows
<font> in <$$font> it or <font> for <$$font> it,"words to that effect ;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.756

I know the word"gallows"was mentioned; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.757

but the concomitant words I do not recollect,"but that he would not
present the petition of a lukewarm people. "GORDON-1781-2,1,20.758

I forgot to tell your Lordship that Lord George Gordon told them to"meet
in four bodies in St. George's-fields;"GORDON-1781-2,1,20.759

each body I think was"to take one quarter of St. George's-fields
. "GORDON-1781-2,1,20.760

Q. Do you recollect any thing more that fell from Lord George
Gordon at the time you are speaking of?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.761

A. I do not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.762

Q. Was you in the lobby of the House of Commons on Friday the 2d
of June?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.763

GORDON-1781-2,1,20.765

Q. Was you in St. George's-fields at the time that had
been appointed?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.767

A. I was.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.768

Q. What time did you get there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.769

A. I believe I might be there at about half past ten or eleven
o'clock.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.770

Q. Did you see the prisoner there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.771

A. I saw him come in a coach.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.772

Q. Recollect yourself GORDON-1781-2,1,20.773

and give an account of what passed there, particularly what fell from
Lord George Gordon himself?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.774

A. I did not hear a word from Lord George; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.775

all that I saw was, that there was a vast number of people, and that
they were occupying four different parts of the field, in four distinct
bodies; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.776

there were two bodies that were forming like soldiers almost, eight or
nine a-breast, a vast number of them; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.777

I did not see them so well formed in any other part as in that part.
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.778

Q. Was there any particular distinction amongst them?
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.779

A. I saw blue ribbands in their hats; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.780

some had the words <font> No popery!  <$$font> upon the ribband.
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.781

Q. What number of people might there be assembled in the fields?
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.782

A. I imagine I speak within compass when I say there were thirty
thousand.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.783

Q. Did you stay till they quitted the place?
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.784

A. I did not; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.785

I left them there.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.786

Q. Did you see any thing that struck you particularly?
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.787

A. I saw Lord George Gordon standing surrounded by a vast number
of people, GORDON-1781-2,1,20.788

and I understood him to be speaking to them, GORDON-1781-2,1,20.789

but I was not near enough to hear him speak.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.790

Q. You left Lord George Gordon in St. George's Fields
I believe?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.791

A. I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say whether his Lordship was not
gone at that time.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.792

Q. Did you see any thing more of the prisoner that day?
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.793

A. I did not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.794

<heading>

Mr. William Metcalf <font> Cross-examined by <$$font> Mr.
Erskine.  <$$heading> GORDON-1781-2,1,20.796

Q. You say the Hall was so crowded you could not have got in
unless by a friend?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.797

A. I could not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.798

Q. And you was placed in the gallery?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.799

A. I got into the gallery.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.800

Q. Can you recollect what time of the evening it was when you
got into the gallery?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.801

A. I took no notice of it at the time; GORDON-1781-2,1,20.802

the only way I can judge of it is, I dined that day at Goldsmith's-Hall,
which is close to that Hall; and after dinner we proposed to go there;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.803

I suppose it was after six o'clock.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.804

Q. How long did you stay?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.805

A. I do not think I was there more than a quarter of an hour;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.806

if I was there a quarter of an hour it was the outside.
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.807

Q. Where was Lord George Gordon when he spoke this;
GORDON-1781-2,1,20.808

was he in the chair?  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.809

A. At the upper end of the room.  GORDON-1781-2,1,20.810

<P_1,21>

Q. You made use of an expression which afterwards you said you
was not sure about; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.812

you used the word <font> gallows?  <$$font> GORDON-1781-2,1,21.813

A. I said I would not be positive to the exact words in which
Lord George Gordon expressed himself; but that he would go to the <font>
gallows <$$font> in the cause, or for the cause, or to that effect.
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.814

Q. Are you sure of the word <font> gallows?  <$$font>
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.815

A. I am very sure he made use of that word.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.816

Q. You did not hear any more about what the cause was, did you?
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.817

A. I understood at the time, that the meeting was for the purpose
of presenting the petition.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.818

Q. You said you went out of curiosity, not knowing the purpose
of the meeting; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.819

and then you spoke of hearing of the cause?  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.820

A. Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.821

Q. Was you at Coachmaker's-hall on the 29th of May?
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.825

A. I was there upon a Monday; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.826

I will not be positive as to its being the 29th of May,
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.827

it was the latter end of May.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.828

Q. Did you see Lord George Gordon there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.829

A. I did.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.830

Q. Did he or any person else act as president in any meeting that
was then held?  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.831

A. I understood him to be acting as president;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.832

he appeared to me to be acting as president.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.833

Q. What was the substance of the conversation at that meeting?
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.834

A. I heard Lord George Gordon say"he called that meeting for
the purpose of informing them that he meant to present their petition"
<paren> meaning the petition of the Protestant Association, <$$paren>"
upon the Friday following to the House of Commons; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.835

he desired them to meet him in St. George's-fields, on the
Friday following, for the purpose of presenting their petition.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,21.836

I do not mean to be very accurate as to the words, GORDON-1781-2,1,21.837

it is impossible to recollect the very words at this distance of time;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.838

he said,"if there was one man less than twenty thousand he would not
present the petition. "GORDON-1781-2,1,21.839

He declared, after stating that if there was one less than twenty
thousand people he would not meet them there,"that without that number
he did not think that their petition would be of consequence enough.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,21.840

He declared"if they were fewer they must find some other president upon
that occasion; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.841

he would have no more to do with them; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.842

he recommended to them the example of the Scotch, who by their firmness
had carried their point.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.843

He recommended temperance and firmness"GORDON-1781-2,1,21.844

and concluded with telling them"he did not mean them to go into any
danger that he would not share; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.845

for he was ready to go to death for the Protestant cause. "
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.846

<font> Court.  <$$font> Was <font> death <$$font> the word?
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.847

A. No; I rather believe <font> gallows <$$font> was the word,
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.848

but I will not pretend to be accurate to the very words;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.849

that was the principal purport of the speech I heard there.
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.850

Q. Was any thing said that evening about the manner in which
the people were to be distinguished when they came to St.
George's-fields?  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.851

A. That is a circumstance I had forgot; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.852

"he desired all true Protestants and friends of the petition
to distinguish themselves by the mark of blue cockades;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.853

he told them he would meet them in St. George's-fields;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.854

and when they came there, the body that were the London Association
should take the right hand, GORDON-1781-2,1,21.855

and the Scotch should take the left hand. "GORDON-1781-2,1,21.856

He disposed of the other two I do not exactly remember how.
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.857

Q. Was you present near, or about the House of Commons, upon
the Friday after the day when the petition was actually presented?
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.858

A. Upon the Friday after I was in the lobby of the House of
Commons, GORDON-1781-2,1,21.859

and was about the House of Commons in the evening.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.860

Q. Did you see Lord George Gordon there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.861

A. I came in by the door that goes down to the House of Lords;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.862

I came forward towards the door of the House of Commons;
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.863

when I came near the door of the House of Commons, I saw Lord George
leaning from a gallery that looks down into the lobby of the House of
Commons; GORDON-1781-2,1,21.864

it is the gallery that goes from the committee rooms to the back door:
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.865

I heard Lord George Gordon address the people from that place.
GORDON-1781-2,1,21.866

He came out, as I understood, for the purpose of telling them what had
passed in the House.  GORDON-1781-2,1,21.867

He told them"that they had been called a mob within the House;
"GORDON-1781-2,1,21.868

he mentioned"that the peace-officers had been called in to disperse
them,"GORDON-1781-2,1,21.869

I think he said"them peaceable petitioners. "GORDON-1781-2,1,21.870

<P_1,22>

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> Did he or not say that?
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.872

A. I think he did,"That they had not given their reasons to the
house why they had not dispersed them; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.873

he believed the peace officers had signed the petition.  That some people
had mentioned in the house something relating to calling in the military.
That he hoped nobody would think of taking a step of that sort, as it
would infallibly tend to create great divisions amongst his Majesty's
subjects. "GORDON-1781-2,1,22.874

He went on stating the impropriety of calling a military force in upon
such occasions in a free country.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.875

He again mentioned the Scotch, pretty much in the same terms that he had
done before,"how they by their steadiness and firmness had carried their
point; that he had no doubt his Majesty would send to his ministers to
desire them to repeal the act, when he found the confusion it created"-
or rather, which is nearer the idea,"when his Majesty heard that his
subjects were coming up, were flocking from miles round, and wishing
its repeal. "GORDON-1781-2,1,22.876

There was a great deal of confusion in the lobby; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.877

several people called to Lord George Gordon, whether he desired them
to disperse?  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.878

"Do you desire us to go away?  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.879

Does Lord George Gordon desire us to go away? "GORDON-1781-2,1,22.880

He replied,"You are the best judges of what you ought to do,
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.881

but I will tell you how the matter stands: GORDON-1781-2,1,22.882

the House are going to divide upon the question, whether your
petition shall be taken into consideration now or upon Tuesday.
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.883

There are for taking it into consideration now, myself and six or
seven others.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.884

If it is not taken into consideration now, your petition may be lost.
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.885

To-morrow the house does not meet; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.886

Monday is the King's birth-day; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.887

upon Tuesday the parliament may be dissolved"- or -"prorogued"
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.888

I forget which was the expression.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.889

That is almost all I heard him say.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.890

There was a good deal of confusion in the lobby; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.891

several other members attempted to speak, particularly Mr. Turner
; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.892

but he was not heard.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.893

I observed some further conversation pass between Lord George
Gordon and the Chaplain of the House, which I could not overhear.
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.894

Q. Were the people, whom Lord George Gordon was then addressing,
distinguished from the other people?  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.895

A. There were a vast number of people in the lobby of the house in
blue cockades to whom he was addressing himself.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.896

Q. Did you happen to be in Scotland at the time of any riots there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.897

A. I was not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.898

Q. Of course you do not know what happened there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.899

A. Not from my own knowledge.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.900

GORDON-1781-2,1,22.903

Q. Did you officiate as chaplain in the House of Commons upon
the 2d of June last?  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.904

A. I did.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.905

Q. Did you observe, in the course of that day any uncommon
concourse of people about the House of Commons, and in the lobby?
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.906

A. I attended the Speaker to the House; GORDON-1781-2,1,22.907

the lobby was exceedingly crowded, and the people there very clamourous.
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.908

We got in without much interruption.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.909

After prayers were over, I went GORDON-1781-2,1,22.910

and sat under the gallery, not far from the door.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.911

The tumult in the lobby continued, GORDON-1781-2,1,22.912

and while the house were deliberating what measures they should
take to quel it, I saw Lord George Gordon frequently go to the door,
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.913

and heard him repeat to the people in the lobby what different members
had said in the debates.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.914

The Speaker was relating to the house, for the information of
those members, who had not been present from the beginning, several
circumstances that had occurred.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.915

<font> Mr. Howarth.  <$$font> You will confine yourself to the
expressions Lord George Gordon made use of to the people in the lobby,
while he was out of the House, and not relate any expressions he made
use of in the House?  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.916

A. I saw him go to the door, GORDON-1781-2,1,22.917

and heard him say to the people,"The Speaker of the House of Commons
has just said that you are all come here under a pretence of religion.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,22.918

And I think his lordship then added,"you are good people,
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.919

your's is a good cause. "GORDON-1781-2,1,22.920

Afterwards I heard him say,"Mr. Burke, member for Bristol has
laid"- GORDON-1781-2,1,22.921

the door was then shut, GORDON-1781-2,1,22.922

and I heard no more.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.923

Afterwards he called out,"Mr. Rous, member for <paren> I forget
the place which he mentioned <$$paren> has just moved that the civil
power be sent for, GORDON-1781-2,1,22.924

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you mind, GORDON-1781-2,1,22.925

keep yourselves cool, GORDON-1781-2,1,22.926

be steady. "GORDON-1781-2,1,22.927

At another time his lordship called out,"Lord North calls you a mob.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,22.928

Once, while Lord George Gordon was at the door, I saw a gentleman go
up to him, who seemed to me to be persuading his lordship to return to
his seat.  GORDON-1781-2,1,22.929

Q. You say <font> seemed <$$font> to persuade?
GORDON-1781-2,1,22.930

<P_1,23>

<font> A. <$$font> I judged so from the manner of it.
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.932

As soon as Lord George Gordon turned round and saw who it was, he called
out to the people"this is Sir Michael le Fleming, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.933

he has just been speaking for you. "GORDON-1781-2,1,23.934

His lordship seemed to me remarkably pleased with Sir Michael,
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.935

he patted or stroaked his shoulder, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.936

and expressed a kind of joy in his countenance which I hardly know how
to describe; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.937

it seemed to me extravagant, and if I may use the expression, childish.
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.938

This is all I recollect, to this period, whilst I was sitting under the
gallery of the House.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.939

When the division was called for, upon the question in the house,
I withdrew.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.940

During the delay and confusion, which was occasioned by the people, who
refused to quit the lobby, and by that means prevented the House from
dividing, I was frequently in the adjoining room; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.941

once while I was standing near the little gallery over the lobby, I saw
some $gentlemen {TEXT:genelemen} endeavouring to persuade the people to
retire, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.942

one of the gentlemen asked me to speak to them; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.943

accordingly I spoke a few words; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.944

I told them they stopped their own business GORDON-1781-2,1,23.945

and begged them to retire, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.946

I heard a person in the lobby say very distinctly,"if his lordship
would come and say that it was necessary for them to go they would go.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,23.947

Some time after this I went up into the eating room;
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.948

while I was sitting at table Lord George Gordon came into the room;
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.949

soon afterwards there were scarce any person left in the room besides
Lord George Gordon and myself; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.950

his lordship had thrown himself into a chair near me,
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.951

and seemed overcome with heat and fatigue; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.952

I thought the opportunity so favourable that I could not help telling
his lordship what I had just heard from the lobby, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.953

I told him that a person there had said that,"if his lordship would
come and say that it was necessary for them to go; they would go,
"GORDON-1781-2,1,23.954

and I added as my own opinion, that I believed it depended wholly upon
his lordship to disperse them; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.955

his lordship made no reply, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.956

and soon after left the room.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.957

Some time after this, I went down stairs, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.958

and seeing his lordship go towards the little gallery to address the
people, I hastened to get near him; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.959

his lordship I think began with advising them, in general terms, "to be
quiet and peaceable, and steady; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.960

his majesty <paren> said his lordship <$$paren> is a gracious monarch,
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.961

and when he hears that the people ten miles round <paren> I think ten
miles round was the expression <$$paren> are collecting; there is no
doubt but that he will send his ministers private orders to repeal the
bill. "GORDON-1781-2,1,23.962

His lordship then mentioned the attempt that was made to introduce a
bill into Scotland;"GORDON-1781-2,1,23.963

the Scotch <paren> said his lordship <$$paren> had no redress, till they
pulled down the Mass-houses; GORDON-1781-2,1,23.964

Lord Weymouth then sent official assurances, that the act should not be
extended to them, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.965

and why should they be better off than you. "GORDON-1781-2,1,23.966

Here I must observe I have a doubt upon my mind, whether his lordship
said"the Scotch had no redress till they pulled down the Mass-houses,
"or whether he said,"when the Scotch pulled down the Mass houses they
had redress;"GORDON-1781-2,1,23.967

his lordship then"advised them to be quiet and peaceable,
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.968

and told them to beware of evil-minded persons who would mix among
them and intice them to mischief, the blame of which <paren>
I think his lordship added <$$paren> would be imputed to them.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,23.969

It was then I think a person in the lobby asked his lordship"if it was
not necessary for them to retire. "GORDON-1781-2,1,23.970

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> Had that person a blue cockade in
his hat?  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.971

<font> A. <$$font> I did not see his person, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.972

I only heard his voice.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.973

"I will tell you <paren> said his lordship <$$paren> how it is;
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.974

the question was put,"I think he said"I moved the question , that your
petition be taken into consideration this night.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.975

Now, says he, it was clearly against you, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.976

there can be no doubt, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.977

but I insisted upon dividing the House: GORDON-1781-2,1,23.978

No division can"take place while you are there, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.979

but to go or not I leave to yourselves. "GORDON-1781-2,1,23.980

As soon as his lordship had finished, he asked me,"if I would speak to
the people? "GORDON-1781-2,1,23.981

I said, by no means, that his lordship was the only person who could
speak to them with any good effect.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.982

His lordship then took hold of my gown GORDON-1781-2,1,23.983

and presenting me to the people called out,"this is the clergyman of
the House of Commons.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.984

I desire you will ask him what his opinion of the Popish Bill is,
"GORDON-1781-2,1,23.985

and immediately urged me to give it.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.986

I replied to his lordship, with considerable warmth, that the only opinion
I should give, was, that all the consequences which might arise from that
night would be entirely owing to his lordship.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.987

Several gentlemen that were about us repeated my words.
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.988

His lordship made no reply, GORDON-1781-2,1,23.989

and went into the House.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.990

<font> Q. <$$font> Had you an opportunity of observing what
number of people were in the lobby, and about the House at any time
during this conversation?  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.991

A. The lobby was full.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.992

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you observe any thing in the hats of the
persons to whom his lordship addressed himself?  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.993

A. I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say absolutely that I did,
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.994

I saw his lordship had a blue cockade.  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.995

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you hear any general cry by the people in
the lobby?  GORDON-1781-2,1,23.996

A. They often called out for Lord George Gordon:
GORDON-1781-2,1,23.997

as I followed the Speaker in, they called out <font> Repeal, Repeal,
Repeal.  <$$font> GORDON-1781-2,1,23.998

<P_1,24>

<font> Q. <$$font> What was the conduct of the persons in the
lobby?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1000

A. They were exceedingly clamorous, GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1001

I do not recollect any particular act of violence, only they made a
great noise.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1002

<font> Q. <$$font> Was there any articulate cry?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1003

A. I do not remember any.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1004

<font> Court.  <$$font> Could the members pass to and from the House?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1005

A. I saw several members come in with blue cockades in their hats
; GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1006

they seemed as if they could hardly pass through the mob.

GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1010

I saw several gentlemen come in to take their seats,
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1012

therefore I presume they were members.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1013

Q. Several?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1014

A. I believe there were two.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1015

I saw one take out the cockade, as soon as he came into the House,

Q. Was this conversation with Lord George in the gallery or
the lobby?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1019

A. At the gallery that looks into the lobby.
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1020

Q. During that time there was a great tumult and noise?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1021

A. Not during the time Lord George was speaking.
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1022

Q. But during the time you had that private conversation?

A. That was not in the gallery.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1024

Q. Were there many people there?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1029

A. Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1030

Q. Did you see Mr. Anstruther there?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1031

A. I did not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1032

Q. I presume you were under some agitation of mind at the time?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1033

A. I was under none till Lord George spoke to me to give my
opinion.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1034

Q. Before that time you was under no apprehensions?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1035

A. No particular apprehensions.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1036

Q. You had your full memory about you, GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1037

and now undertake to speak to the very words.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1038

You have not reduced them into writing, have you?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1039

A. On Friday this happened; GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1040

the next day there was an account in the papers of what happened there,
in which I was mentioned; GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1041

as I attended the Speaker as his Chaplain, I thought it necessary to
write to the Speaker to give him an account of it, which I did in part.
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1042

Q. When Lord George told the people, that you was chaplain of the
House of Commons, that put you into a considerable flurry of spirits?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1043

A. In a degree it did.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1044

<font> Mr. Howarth.  <$$font> How long did you stay in the House?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1045

A. I came away with Mr. Bacon in his carriage.
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1046

Q. At what time was the lobby cleared?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1047

A. I stayed till the House broke up, GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1048

the passages were then quite clear.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1049

Q. Do you know how they came cleared?  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1050

A. I do not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1051

Q. Did you see any soldiers there when you came away?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1052

A. I saw some at some of the avenues.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1053

Q. Did you go away as soon as you were able?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1054

A. I wished to go away much earlier.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1055

I went away after the House broke up.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1056

I had an engagement on duty that evening.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1057

I went to the door-keeper of the back stair-case, GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1058

he said if I went out they would not admit me again,
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1059

therefore I was obliged to stay.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1060

I was afraid to go out with my gown on.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1061

GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1064

Q. On the 2d of June last you was in the House of Commons?
GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1065

A. I was.  GORDON-1781-2,1,24.1066

<P_1,25>

Q. Had you any occasion to observe any thing that passed in the
lobby at the time?  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1068

A. Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1069

Q. What did you see or hear from the lobby on the 2d of June?
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1070

A. As I had the honour of being in the last parliament with
the noble lord, I shall be obliged to the Court for one moment's
indulgence to explain my situation, out of respect to the noble prisoner.
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1071

Having publickly related all that I have now to relate, in another
place, and in the presence of the noble prisoner, immediately after it
happened, when I could have no view of this trial, I suppose to be a
reason why I have been applied to by those whose duty it is to carry on
this prosecution.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1072

I hope the court and the noble prisoner will see that I am here without
being officious, and free from malice or ill will, GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1073

but having said this, I must take the liberty of saying, when
called before a court, I shall not shrink from that evidence.
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1074

<font> Court.  <$$font> There is no apology necessary,
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1075

every man must give his evidence.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1076

A. On Friday the 2d of June, as I was passing from one of the
Committee-rooms, while the lobby was filled with a multitude of strangers,
and the House of Commons was under a question which they could not decide,
as the serjeant and the officers of the House could not clear the lobby;
as I was going through the passage at the top of the stair-case, where
there is a rail that looks into the lobby, I heard and saw a person in
the lobby who called aloud two or three times <font> Lord George Gordon!
<$$font> GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1077

I turned round GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1078

and saw the noble prisoner near, who on hearing himself called came to
the rail and looked over.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1079

I did the same close to him.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1080

The same person said,"My Lord we are ordered to clear the lobby;
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1081

if your lordship wishes we should clear it, we will do it directly,
and without any trouble. "GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1082

<font> One of the Jury.  <$$font> Was this one of the officers of
the House?  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1083

A. No, a stranger.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1084

The noble prisoner replied,"I will tell you how the case stands:
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1085

I have moved to have your petition taken now into consideration.
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1086

Alderman Bull and two or three more are for it, GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1087

the rest are against it; GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1088

therefore if you wish your petition should be taken now into consideration
you may stay or do as you please. "GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1089

All in the lobby were silent and attentive; GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1090

as soon as the noble prisoner had said what I last related they pulled
off their hats GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1091

and cried,"<font> Now, now, now.  <$$font>"GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1092

I do not recollect any thing else.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1093

Q. Was any thing said by you to Lord George, or by Lord George
to you?  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1094

A. I recollect there was a kind of pause.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1095

The noble lord leaned over again, GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1096

and said,"Would not you wish to be in the same state they are in in
Scotland? "GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1097

they answered"Yes, yes,"GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1098

and he said,"Well well;"GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1099

that is all I recollect.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1100

GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1122

A. He came to the door two or three times; GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1123

I am not certain to the number of times; GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1124

he told them"he should come out and let them know what was going on
in the House; they had a good cause, and they had nothing to fear.
"GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1125

Lord George Gordon came up once, GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1126

and said"Sir Michael le Fleming had spoke in their behalf, and that he
spoke like an angel. "GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1127

They crowded much upon me.  GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1128

I said for God's sake, Gentlemen, keep from the door.
GORDON-1781-2,1,25.1129

Lord George put out his hand in this manner, <font> <paren> waving it

A. They were all very quiet when I went; GORDON-1781-2,1,26.1150

afterwards the passage was very much crowded, so that it was difficult to
make room for the members to go up to the lobby; GORDON-1781-2,1,26.1151

by my endeavouring to make room for them they knew they were members,
GORDON-1781-2,1,26.1152

as soon as I entered the Guildhall, a messenger from the House of Lords
told me I was wanted there.  GORDON-1781-2,1,26.1179

I went with him to the House of Lords, where I received directions to
clear the avenues to that House.  GORDON-1781-2,1,26.1180

The messenger who came from the Lords having told me the Lords were much
interrupted in going to and coming from the House, I directed Smith,

come to me.  GORDON-1781-2,1,26.1181

Having received the directions I mentioned I returned to the Guildhall;

it was exceedingly full; GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1247

the door of the House was open; GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1248

I made my way into the chapel; GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1267

it was not then on fire; GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1268

they had torn down the organ GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1269

and had made fires in the street; GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1270

and other people threw it into the fire; GORDON-1781-2,1,27.1272

there were not above five or six people in the chapel;

I immediately seised a young fellow who was in the chapel.

Upon my going up I desired every person in the chapel might be taken
into custody.  GORDON-1781-2,1,28.1311

The gentlemen there thought I understood something of rioting business.
GORDON-1781-2,1,28.1312

A. Not to my knowledge.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1728

Q. Did you ever see him write any thing but his name?
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1729

A. To my knowledge I never saw him write.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1730

Q. Do you mean to say to the best of your recollection and belief
you never saw him write?  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1731

A. To the best of my recollection and belief I never saw him write.
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1732

Q. Nor had any correspondence with him?  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1733

A. None that I know of.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1734

John Dingwall <font> Cross-examined by Mr. <$$font> Erskine.
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1735

Q. Though you have had no correspondence in writing
with Lord George Gordon, yet you are well acquainted with him
{COM:for_his_writings;_see_errata}?  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1736

A. Yes, but I never had any business with him.
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1737

Q. How long have you been acquainted with Lord George Gordon?
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1738

A. From his birth.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1739

Q. Did you see Lord George Gordon at any time,
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1740

and how long before this meeting that took place in St.
George's-fields?  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1741

A. I saw him the night before the meeting in May.
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1742

Q. Do you recollect whether Lord George Gordon, that night
in May, said any thing to you upon the subject of this business?
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1743

<font> Mr. Attorney General.  <$$font> What Lord George Gordon
said may be evidence against himself GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1744

but $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be evidence for him.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1745

<font> Court.  <$$font> Unless it is connected with the time that they
have spoke of at Coachmaker's-hall, or St. George's-fields.
GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1746

<font> Mr. Erskine.  <$$font> It is connected with that particular
time.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1747

- I submit to your Lordship, that I have a right to put this question,
whether or no he saw Lord George Gordon the night before the 29th of May
, and whether Lord George Gordon said any thing to him upon the subject
of that meeting.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1748

<font> Court.  <$$font> The distinction is this.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1749

If you call him to the meeting upon the 29th they having given evidence
of what he said at that meeting, you may shew the whole connexion of
what he said there besides, GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1750

but you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} go into evidence relating to the day
before.  GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1751

<font> Mr. Kenyon.  <$$font> The meeting which was held in
St. George's-fields on the 2d of June, either was or was not
legally assembled; GORDON-1781-2,1,34.1752

the motives for which they assembled, if Lord <P_1,35> George Gordon
was the assembler of it, will go a great way to shew whether they were
legally assembled or not.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1753

If assembled for purposes hostile to the laws, it was illegal,
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1754

but if Lord George Gordon conceived it constitutional to go up with it
, with a considerable number of persons, and if he had assigned the
reason why he was so to go up, that it was to remove the imputation
that he was carrying up a petition with forged names to it, I submit to
your lordship, that whatever the motives were, it constitutes either
criminality or guilt, or absolves him from the guilt with which he is
charged; GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1755

therefore I humbly conceive, that if Lord George Gordon, can demonstrate
to the satisfaction of your lordship and the jury, what the motives were
which induced him to take the people there, it will go a great way,
not only in extenuation of his offence, but will totally to {COM:sic}
extirpate the crime.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1756

<font> Court.  <$$font> There $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be a doubt of it -
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1757

his motive $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be proved by his own private
declaration.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1758

<font> Mr. Erskine.  <$$font> Your lordship was pleased to
observe to me that I was going to a time antecedent to the time put;
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1759

your lordship will remember Mr. Hay, the first witness on the
part of the crown, has spoken to the expressions of Lord George Gordon,
as early as the February before; GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1760

and these are declarations subsequent to that, GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1761

and it seems an extraordinary thing that a man should be called up to
condemn Lord George Gordon for words he has spoken, and that another man,
who has heard him speak words subsequent to that period, shall not be
permitted to explain that.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1762

Your lordship said it was a time antecedent - GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1763

I conceive it was not antecedent, because evidence has been given of
expressions of his lordship's antecedent to that.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1764

I am now speaking of the 29th of May, GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1765

and Hay speaks of December, January, and February.
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1766

<font> Court.  <$$font> Not of any particular expressions he made use
of previous to the 29th of May.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1767

- It makes no difference whether it is precedent or subsequent,
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1768

he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} give evidence of his motives by his own
private declarations.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1769

<font> <paren> Mr. Metcalf gave into court extracts from the
journals of the House of Commons, of the progress through the House of
the act of parliament to repeal part of the act of the 11th and 12th of
William III <$$paren>.  <$$font> GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1770

<font> Mr. Attorney General.  <$$font> Call General Skene.
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1771

<font> Mr. Kenyon.  <$$font> My Lord, I understand the witness
now called, is to be examined to prove there were riots in Scotland;
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1772

I object to the receiving such testimony.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1773

<font> Mr. Attorney General.  <$$font> The example Lord
George Gordon held out to them is the very riot in Scotland.
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1774

<font> Mr. Kenyon.  <$$font> If the legislature found this was
contrary to the sense of the people in Scotland, they did wisely perhaps
in complying with the wishes of the people.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1775

It is the duty of governors, in general, to comply with the sense of
the governed.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1776

Any riot that may have happened in Scotland, I submit to your lordship,
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be proved; GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1777

it would be an eternal disgrace upon government if it should
be proved that the Legislature gave way to riots in Scotland.
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1778

Your lordship will recollect the language of the witnesses:
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1779

Lord George Gordon exhorted the people to be temperate and firm; that
the people in Scotland had by such means prevailed upon the legislature
not to extend the laws to that country.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1780

<font> Mr. Erskine.  <$$font> I submit to your lordship, all
the witnesses that have spoken upon what Lord George Gordon said with
respect to this business in Scotland, have said he desired them to be
firm and temperate GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1781

for by that means the brethren in Scotland had redress from parliament,
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1782

but it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be mentioned in this court, without an
eternal disgrace to the legislature, that that redress was given to them
because of those riots, which are supposed to have existed in Scotland
, which riots have not been proved to exist, and which ought not to be
proved to exist, because they have no relation to the present enquiry,
unless the gentlemen on the other side can shew that Lord George Gordon
had desired the people here to burn houses as the mob did in Scotland;
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1783

therefore I conceive it is impossible to be brought home as evidence in
this cause.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1784

<font> Court.  <$$font> The counsel for the crown do not mean to impute
the demolition of the mass-houses in Scotland to Lord George Gordon.
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1785

I understand the evidence offered is with a view to shew, that the speech
which is attributed to Lord George Gordon related to a fact which had
existence; GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1786

for some of the witnesses have told us that Lord George Gordon said
the Scotch had no redress till they pulled down the mass-houses.
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1787

<font> Mr. Erskine.  <$$font> Who pulled down the mass-houses?
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1788

will it be shewn that the Protestant Association pulled down these
mass-houses.  {COM:sic} GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1789

Lord George Gordon addressing himself to the Protestant Association in
England, mentioned the firmness and unanimity of his brethren of the
Protestant Association in Scotland.  GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1790

Will any witness attempt to prove that the Protestant Association
in Scotland were ever guilty of such riots.  {COM:sic}
GORDON-1781-2,1,35.1791

<P_1,36>

<font> Mr. Solicitor General.  <$$font> The question is, whether
we are to give evidence of the destruction of these mass-houses, of which
Lord George Gordon has spoken in express terms?  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1793

The question now is not, as to the operation and force of that evidence.
GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1794

The prisoner's language is, that in Scotland some mass-houses were
destroyed; GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1795

that must have a meaning.  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1796

The single question is, whether we are not at liberty to prove that the
mass-houses in Scotland were destroyed?  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1797

<font> Court.  <$$font> They have given in evidence, by two or three
witnesses, that when those people were assembled together the example
of the Scotch had been held forth, GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1798

and it is delivered in different expressions; GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1799

one says he told them,"the Scotch by their firmness and steadiness had
carried their point, and he had no doubt but when his Majesty heard his
subjects were flocking from miles around he would send to his ministers
to repeal the act;"GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1800

in another place, he says,"the Scotch carried their point by their
firmness,"GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1801

and more particularly the evidence of Mr. Bowen is expressly
this,"there was an attempt to introduce a bill for Scotland - that
the Scotch had no redress till they pulled down the mass-houses,
"GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1802

and there are two or three other allusions, to understand which it is
absolutely necessary to know what the fact was; GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1803

it is not imputed to any particular person, GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1804

but the fact is, that the Scotch pulled down the mass-houses,
GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1805

and there has not any bill been brought into parliament including them
in it.  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1806

A. They wanted to pull down Popery.  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1821

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you know how they were appeased?
GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1822

A. I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say; GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1823

I ordered troops from all quarters to march into town, which I believe
was the cause of their being appeased.  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1824

but I do not remember the exact date.  GORDON-1781-2,1,36.1836

Q. What did the people do that assembled together there?

it is so notorious.  GORDON-1781-2,1,37.1906

<heading>

<font> For The Prisoner.  <$$font> GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1913

Mr. Kenyon.  <$$heading> <font> Gentlemen of the Jury <$$font>
, The counsel for the prosecution having stopped in this stage of the
business, giving as a reason for not producing more witnesses, that
they are afraid of tiring out the patience of the Court and the Jury,
it is the misfortune of the prisoner to make his defence at that period
of the day, when the attention of the Court and the Jury must be, in
some measure, exhausted.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1914

There are other difficulties which he also labours under;
GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1915

for, upon this occasion, I, who am assigned, by the Court, to be one
of his Counsel, confess myself to be a person very little versed in the
Criminal Courts; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1916

I never yet stood as a Counsel for a person who had so great a stake
put in hazard; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1917

and therefore, Gentlemen, in addressing you for him, I stand as a person
in very considerable agitation of mind for the consequences which may
happen through my defects.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1918

When persons are accused of actions of great enormity, one is apt to
look round about one to see what the motives were that could induce the
parties so to act; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1919

the prisoner at the bar stands before you a member of one of the most
considerable families in this country.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1920

At the time when this conduct is imputed to him, he was a member of the
legislature; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1921

he stood in a situation which he was not likely to better by throwing
the country into convulsions.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1922

A person that stood in the situation he stood in, could not make his
prospect better than in seeing the affairs of the country conducted
under legal government; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1923

and if he thought any inroads had been made upon those laws which
the wisdom of our ancestors had enacted, it was his business to
bring about the repeal of those laws, to redress those grievances,
by proper legal means, and not by causing a revolt in this country.
GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1924

This being the case, and as his conduct may be imputed to good or bad
motives, it seems reasonable, and humanity will induce you to impute
it to proper, rather than improper motives, the noble prisoner being,
as I have said, a man standing in a situation who had every thing to
expect so long as law prevailed; but nothing to expect when anarchy was
substituted in the place of law.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1925

The crime imputed to the noble prisoner is, that he being a liege subject
of the King, had levied war against the King.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1926

The crime is imputed to him under an act of parliament enacted for the
wisest purpose, that crimes of this very enormous nature should not
depend upon loose construction; but that men, in their journey through
life, might, by looking upon the statute, see what the plan of their
duty was, might see what the rocks were upon which they were not to run;
and might see, in the plain words of the statute, what they were to do,
and what to avoid.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1927

The Attorney General has told you, very properly, that the crime which
he meant to impute to him was not a crime against the person of the King,
but that it was a constructive treason.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1928

Gentlemen, I have only to lament, that there is such a phrase in the
law as <font> constructive <$$font> treason.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1929

At the time when the law was enacted, I verily believe the legislature had
it not in their contemplation, that the words constructive treason, would
find their way into the Courts at Westminster; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1930

but however, so it seems, the law is; GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1931

for so it seems, upon some certain occasions, judges have decided.
GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1932

The offence <paren> when it comes to be more particularly described
<$$paren> which is imputed to the prisoner is, that he had levied war
by collecting together a numerous assembly to effect, by violence
, an alteration of a law, and procure a redress of grievances;
GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1933

and in order that Mr. Attorney General might get your inclinations
to run before the evidence he gave, and that he might be in possession
of that which ought never to be roused upon these occasions, namely,
the passions of those who are to try the cause; he, in terms of great
aggravation, compared with the evidence that has been given, stated to
you, that the whole city might have been burnt; that there was great
reason to believe this had been concerted by our foreign enemies;
that they mixed in this business; and that, therefore, the Bank was
to be attacked, the public credit sapped, and every thing thrown into
confusion, and we to be delivered up, bound neck and heels, an easy prey
to our enemies abroad.  GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1934

I dare say, he did not mean to do what was improper;
GORDON-1781-2,2,3.1935

but, surely, <P_2,4> it was most improper.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1936

In businesses of this kind it is not the duty of an advocate, in
stating his case to a jury, to enhance the crime beyond the degree of
guilt it will fairly bear when the evidence is produced before you:
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1937

and if any thing has been said beyond the fair import of the evidence,
it has not been well said, by the counsel who conducts the prosecution
for the Crown.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1938

Gentlemen, the other part of his speech was confined in stating to you
the evidence which he meant to give: GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1939

but, Gentlemen, in stating that evidence, I wish he had not used some
of the phrases which he did use.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1940

I wish, when he spoke of the multitude collected together, he had not
called them an army; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1941

I wish, when he spoke of them in other parts of his speech, he had
not compared them to armies, talked of their being led in triumph, and
supposed they had gone arrayed in military form, to bring about this
redress of grievances, which he supposed was, and which was perhaps to
a certain extent, the intent of their meeting.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1942

Several witnesses have been called; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1943

you have observed the manner in which they have given their evidence,
and attended to the effect of it.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1944

The first was William Hay; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1945

he has stated to you the several meetings at which Lord George Gordon
was: GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1946

and when he came to correct himself, upon the cross-examination, it
appeared he had over-stated it; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1947

for he was forced at last to admit that Lord George never had, to his
knowledge, been in Greenwood's Room.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1948

How he came to have been in a situation to give evidence, is not disclosed
to you.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1949

He appears to have been at all the meetings, at more than Lord George
Gordon was at; - that he was in the Lobby of the House of Commons ; in
the Chapel at Duke-street; at the burning of the Fleet; at the Chapel in
Moorfields; and that he was in Great Queen-street.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1950

What the motives were, which led him there, I do not know.
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1951

But this I know; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1952

it has ascertained one fact, and a pretty important fact in this case;
that at every and all of these places there were persons who had nothing
to do with Lord George Gordon; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1953

they were officious persons who crouded into the business; encreased,
if they did not make the croud, which was at many of these places.
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1954

He tells you, that the people who got together in Saint George's Fields
were <font> arrayed <$$font>, as he calls it, in their best clothes.
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1955

Now, why the word <font> arrayed <$$font> got into his mouth,
I do not know; except he had been told, that if people came there
arrayed in a military manner, it considerably enhanced their guilt.
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1956

He told you also, that the people marched in <font> columns <$$font>
; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1957

you will observe again another military word: GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1958

he was upon his cross-examination asked whether Lord George Gordon
desired they should march in columns or divisions; GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1959

he admitted the language he used was divisions: GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1960

why then should he vary from the conversation or directions of the
prisoner he was giving evidence against?  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1961

If it was done to give a different colour to the transaction, and the
phrase is so differenced as not to give the colour on the side of mercy ,
which a man speaking in the case of blood ought to give, I impute it as
misbehaviour to that witness.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1962

He tells you, that at one of the meetings at the Crown and Rolls, <paren>
and he is the single person who speaks to it <$$paren> Lord George Gordon
said,"that by the King's assenting to the Quebec bill, his Majesty,
or his Counsellors, had brought him to that pass to which king James
the second was brought after his abdication.  "GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1963

Now, could a man of sense possibly use these words?
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1964

How was he like king James the second after his abdication?
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1965

had his Majesty abdicated the Government?  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1966

was not he in possession of the throne?  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1967

was he not in possession of all the force of the Country?
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1968

How was it possible to conceive that the noble person at the bar then
could use such language?  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1969

When witnesses come singly to state facts which never existed, it
is impossible, perhaps, to prove that those words might not pass.
GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1970

But if one travels into the field of probability, and if you see the
whole of their evidence is improbable, and they supported by no other
witnesses, then the great improbability on the one side, opposed to the
unsupported evidence of such a witness on the other, is sufficient to
get rid of the evidence of that witness.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1971

Was it not possible that other witnesses might be called, supposing this
witness spoke true, to confirm his testimony?  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1972

- he does not state the transaction he speaks of, to have passed in a
corner, where nobody was present, but in a room where a great multitude
of witnesses were present; witnesses, who were accessible by the persons
employed by the Crown, GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1973

and the great list of witnesses which have been talked of by the Attorney
General, to the amount of one hundred and seventy, shews, that those who
were concerned in this prosecution for the Crown have not been negligent
in this business; but have got together those from all quarters who they
thought could speak to the business.  GORDON-1781-2,2,4.1974

<P_2,5>

When I state this witness, hesitating and stammering as he did in some
part of his evidence, and standing unsupported in parts in which he might
have been supported if his testimony was true, for there were parts
of his evidence which were not likely to slip out of the memories of
other people.  {COM:sic} I have a right to conclude that he is speaking
that which is not the truth of the case.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1976

Why did he make notes upon this occasion?  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1977

He said he always does, GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1978

yet never made memorandums but once, and that 20 years ago, in one place.
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1979

Who was the person to whom he made a communication of this?
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1980

To one person only, a man whose respectability I admit, but whose
inclination must be known, because he is stated to be a Roman Catholic.
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1981

Gentlemen, he tells you, that he went home from St. George's
Fields; that he went over Blackfryars bridge, and went to his house,
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1982

and in that house at first, he told me, he staid till he went down to
the lobby in the evening: GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1983

- However, in the former part of his evidence he had mentioned a fact
which passed in Fleet-street; GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1984

it was necessary for him indeed to reconcile the different parts of the
evidence, to bring himself out of the House before the time he went down
to the lobby, GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1985

for he admitted the croud came by a long time before.
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1986

You recollect, he said he saw the flags in Fleet-street;
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1987

therefore in order that he might be consistent <paren> and I did not
choose to wrangle with him upon the occasion, though it certainly was not
exactly correspondent with the evidence he first gave, for he said he went
over Black Fryars Bridge, and was not out of his house till he went down
to the lobby <$$paren> it seems he was out of his house, upon the leads
of St. Dunstan's church, and saw this vast cavalcade of people,
to the amount of 30,000, and was able to distinguish one man so as to know
that the man he saw afterwards with the flag at the House of Commons, was
the very man he saw with the flag in Fleet-street.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1988

Here I must refer to the probability of the case; GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1989

if Juries are to believe Witnesses, merely because they will swear to
facts, Juries are become of little use indeed.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1990

Those who are acquainted with the profession see it,
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1991

and lament when they see it, that there is no fact whatever, that
Witnesses may not be brought up to prove.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1992

It is for Juries, therefore, to discriminate, to judge between the
probable and the improbable, to judge by comparison of the testimony
he gives, with the probability of the case, and to form their judgment
whether that which he says is true.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1993

Juries become of no use if they are to believe it because a witness
swears it; GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1994

they have to lay aside their judgment, and only make use of the faculty
of hearing and speaking, GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1995

and the whole is done.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1996

But that is not their province; GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1997

they are to exercise their judgments; GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1998

they are to winnow the evidence, and get rid of that which is the chaff
; GORDON-1781-2,2,5.1999

and are only to abide by that which informs their sober judgment, and
enables them to say, that here deciding upon the life of a fellow citizen
we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} mistake; we see this man has probability
added to his testimony; we see that he is supported by other witnesses.
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2000

Upon this part of the evidence, I conceive, that can never be said to
be the case.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2001

When he is brought down to the lobby of the House of Commons, you
recollect he told you at first there was great confusion there:
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2002

yet in the midst of that confusion, this man is enabled to go through
a long detail of what passed, circumstantially, minutely, and in the
words in which it is given: GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2003

and yet, Gentlemen, when he has made the most of it, what is it his
testimony proves?  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2004

"That Lord George Gordon only exhorted them to adhere to so good a cause,
that he himself would persevere in it": GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2005

and he said,"that though he had no great expectations from the House
of Commons, yet that they would meet with redress from their mild and
gracious Sovereign. "GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2006

Were they then not to have redress from the House of Commons?
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2007

How does this consist with the hypothesis on the other side?
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2008

The House of Commons were to be coerced to do whatever he should dictate
to them.  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2009

But he tells them,"If the House will not do it for you, you must apply
to the King and his ministers. "GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2010

Is this the language of the man who intended in the moment that the
House of Commons were collected together, that they should by force
and violence be influenced to come to a vote, should do that, which, as
one branch of the legislature, they could not achieve {TEXT:atchieve}?
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2011

Gentlemen, he found afterwards that it was necessary, if he could,
to couple these parties with those he had seen in St. George's
Fields, GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2012

and when he was asked after the parties about the House of Commons,
and stopping up the avenues of the House, how he knew they were the same
persons; did he know any of them?  GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2013

He said, he only saw they had the same flags, and that one of the
men he had seen was the man who carried the flag in Fleet-street.
GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2014

I have before observed upon that, GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2015

you will recollect the station he was in, when he had the view of that
man in Fleet-street, GORDON-1781-2,2,5.2016

and you will, if you can, believe he carried <P_2,6> his ideas of this
man, one man selected from 30,000, and having the ideas of that man's
face in his mind, he was able, when he came to the House of Commons,
to see that man, out of 100 or 200 that he had so happily fixed upon
in Fleet-street.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2017

This Witness then says he went to the Sardinian Ambassador's Chapel,
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2018

and he would have you believe that the persons doing the mischief there
were part of the company who were collected in St. George's Fields.
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2019

But were they so?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2020

Did he know any of them?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2021

- Did he see any of the actors in the business?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2022

Yes; they were a banditti of boys, not any one of them having a cockade.
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2023

I beg you will bear it in your minds, because it was possible, and
is probable, that men of another description were those that did that
business.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2024

If it shall appear in the sequel of the cause, that that was the case,
even from the testimony of this witness - a witness not much inclined
for the defendant; yet he may be pressed into the service of the prisoner
at the bar.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2025

Gentlemen, he tells you there was one person who did the principal
mischief at that chapel.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2026

He does not tell you that - that one man had any badges belonging
to the Association he had seen in St. George's Fields;
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2027

he did not say that man had a cockade; GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2028

that man certainly was a man of a different description from
those that met Lord George Gordon in St. George's Fields,
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2029

or the Counsel for the Crown would have proved who he was.
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2030

But the witness says there was a multitude there.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2031

What did they do?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2032

They <font> seemingly <$$font>, says the Witness, protected them.
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2033

I do not know what <font> seemingly protecting <$$font> is;
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2034

but this I know, that a Witness well inclined to a prosecution
will construe every light action into a <font> seeming <$$font>;
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2035

when you are to decide you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} anchor upon such
evidence as that; it is impossible to say that conveys any information
to your mind; GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2036

therefore, it seems to me, that the whole of what this Witness says
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be looked upon to be important in this case.
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2037

Gentlemen, as I said before, he might have been supported if the facts
that he speaks of were true, GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2038

and who the witnesses were that might have supported his testimony
, might have been learnt by the examination of the man himself;
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2039

for he states to you, that M'Millan, by name, and another person, walked
with him from the lobby of the House of Commons through the whole detail
of this business, seeing what he saw, and judging of those occurrences
he states to you.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2040

Why is not M'Millan called?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2041

Is not M'Millan here?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2042

The Witness tells you he is down in the hall.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2043

Why is he not called?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2044

Is it that intelligence may be withheld from you?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2045

Is it that a witness, suspicious in himself, and speaking suspiciously,
ought not to be supported?  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2046

Is it that the case is to stand or fall by that suspicious testimony?
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2047

Or is it because this witness, if called, would have ripped up the
case told by his principal, and therefore the learned conductor of
the prosecution durst not call him, because he would have stated such
contradictions, and imputed such flagrant falsities to the account given
by Hay, as would not only have taken from Hay all credit, but would in the
outset of the case have stained the prosecution.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2048

The second witness who is called to you is William Metcalf:
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2049

He states to you that he was at Coachmakers-hall; GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2050

and the great matter to affect the noble Prisoner, I presume, is that
he happened to be there called to the chair; that he was the President
of the meeting, and he said"the Scotch had succeeded by unanimity;
"GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2051

the voice of the people was against the wishes of individuals,
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2052

and the wisdom of the legislature yeilded {COM:sic} to the voice of the
people, not to the force and violence of the people, but to the wishes
of the people.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2053

- He desired, therefore, that the same kind of arguments might prevail
here.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2054

As to the wisdom of the act of repeal, I shall say nothing:
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2055

I am as great a friend to toleration as any man that ever addressed
a Jury.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2056

All I can say upon that subject is, that good men and wise men possibly
entertain different opinions.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2057

"He tells you the Scotch had succeeded by unanimity;
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2058

he desired, if he was to do anything for them, that they would be
unanimous upon the subject; GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2059

and he said that those who had signed the petition neither need be afraid
nor ashamed to shew that they had signed it, and to appear at the House;
and that he would not present the petition, or begged leave to decline
it, unless he was met by 20,000 people in St. George's Fields.
GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2060

He recommended that they should have some mark of distinction,
and that he would answer for any that should be molested; that he
wished so well to the cause, that he would go to the gallows for it.
"GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2061

The other honourable Gentleman called afterwards, said he would either
go to the gallows for it, or to death for it.  GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2062

If this matter is capable of explanation, and shall be explained
hereafter to your satisfaction, much as the stress was that was laid
upon the words, I am sure, in your sober judgment, they will not weigh
a feather; GORDON-1781-2,2,6.2063

and having stated the words, it is proper.  I <P_2,7> should accompany
the poison with the antidote, if it should come out, that at this very
meeting at the Hall, there was a contrariety of opinion in the persons
there, whether an act of parliament was in force, or not, which act
prohibited persons, above the number of twenty, carrying any petition to
the legislature; that a gentleman there, of the profession of the law,
was of opinion that that was a subsisting law; and that, therefore,
the parties who went up might be involved in the penalties of that law.
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2064

The prisoner's language arose from a difference of opinion on that
Subject.  GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2065

- Speaking on the sudden, I conceive that that is not a subsisting law.
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2066

Persons who read that statute, and the bill of Rights upon the Revolution
, will, perhaps, find, that one of the articles of the Bill of Rights was
levelled at that law; as we learn from the Bill of Rights, that it is
the birthright of subjects of this country to petition the legislature
; and if they do it in a peaceable manner, whether signed by twenty or
two-hundred, the number makes no difference.  GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2067

Supposing I should be mistaken, yet that point stands very remote from
this case, and at a distance from the question; the degree of guilt
imputed to the prisoner; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2068

for, by that act, a misdemeanor, perhaps, might be introduced,
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2069

and the party might say, I am so clear upon the subject, I will run the
risque of committing the misdemeanor; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2070

but does it from thence follow, that Lord George Gordon had the most
distant allusion to that which followed afterwards, and is now imputed
to him as guilt of this enormous size, that he is guilty of high treason?
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2071

Your imagination must outrun what the witnesses have said;
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2072

and must, by conjecture and inference, in a case of blood, make out
that kind of charge which this evidence has not fixed upon the prisoner.
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2073

Gentlemen, the next witness that was called, I ask your pardon for going
through the evidence; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2074

but I have much anxiety for the cause, GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2075

and choose to omit nothing material.  GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2076

Mr. Anstruther states, that he saw Lord George Gordon at
Coachmakers hall; he understood he was acting as president; "he desired
the parties to meet him at St. George's Field's; assuring them,
that unless there were twenty-thousand people, he would not present the
petition;"GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2077

he says, very honorably and candidly, that, at this distance of time ,
considering the variety of conversations by different parties there,
that it was impossible for him to recollect the words of the speaker;
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2078

he says, the prisoner"recommended following the example of the Scotch,
who, by perseverance, had carried their point; and he recommended to
them temperance upon the subject. "GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2079

That being stated to you by an attentive witness, a man of sense, and
of a considerable station in life, I have no doubt he states truly what
did pass, and states all that materially did pass; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2080

the same witness speaks to what passed in the House of Commons on the
Friday following; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2081

he speaks to all the conversation which Lord George Gordon held when he
was leaning over the rails, and talking to the parties who were in the
lobby below; and that when they asked him whether they should go away,
he told them,"that they were the judges; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2082

- $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you how the matter stands:
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2083

the House is going to divide upon the question, whether your
petition shall be taken into consideration now, or upon Tuesday;
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2084

there are for taking it into consideration now, myself, and six or seven
others; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2085

if not, your petition may be lost; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2086

to-morrow the House does not sit, GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2087

Monday is the King's birth-day, GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2088

and Tuesday, possibly, the parliament may be prorogued. "
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2089

Now, Gentlemen, this he tells you was all that passed when Lord George
Gordon addressed them over the rails; GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2090

and here I wish you would recollect this evidence, bear it in your mind,
and see how far all that is recollected by this witness, and all I shall
presently state to you to be recollected by another witness, comports
with the testimony of the next witness, the Reverend Mr. Bowen.
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2091

Mr. Bowen states to you that he was in the Gallery, that he saw
Lord George Gordon frequently go in and out of the house, that one of
the parties asked him whether it was necessary that they should go or
not; that he told them in the language Mr. Anstruther mentioned;
that he told them in what situation the business was, and left them to
judge whether they would go or not.  GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2092

But this witness went further, GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2093

and told you that his Lordship stated to them,"that an attempt had
been made to introduce the bill into Scotland; that the Scotch had
no redress, till they pulled down the Mass-houses; that Lord Weymouth
sent official assurances that the act should not be extended to them;
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2094

and why should the Scotch be in a better condition than we? "
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2095

Here again, upon words extremely important in this case, you are left
to believe that this is so upon the testimony of a single witness.
GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2096

Mr. Anstruther they called to you, who was present when all
this passed.  GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2097

Mr. Cater was called, who was also in the lobby, and heard
what passed.  GORDON-1781-2,2,7.2098

Neither of these witnesses have stated to you any conversation of
the kind; nor out of the great multitude who were there, men of all
colours <P_2,8> and descriptions, who might easily have been found,
the door-keepers of the House, who were in a situation where it was
impossible that any thing could be said in the lobby, but what they
might hear, and at a time when silence was occasioned by his Lordship's
speaking to them.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2099

I say here again, upon a very important part of the case, you are left
to decide upon the credit of a single witness.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2100

The observation which I before made to you upon this sort of evidence,
will apply to this part of the case.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2101

It is enough for me to observe, that in the most important parts of this
case, as far as you have hitherto travelled in the cause, the Counsel
for the Crown have chosen to leave the most important parts of the case
not only not supported by more than one witness, but not attempted to
be supported by a second witness: GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2102

it is not because a second witness might not be called, if the matter
was true; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2103

but it is because no industry whatever could induce other witnesses to
come to swear in the same language.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2104

I do not wonder that parties are not extremely accurate in their
recollection of what passed on that day: it was a day of tumult and
confusion; a day of much agitation of mind, undoubtedly; and that this
gentleman at that time was frightened, that his mind was agitated, that
he conceived things which perhaps never passed; and that conception
being once got into his mind, he has not been able to erase the ideas
from his mind since.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2105

I can only say that this is possible; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2106

and if you put him in a situation in which his mind was agitated, you
put him in a situation where you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} decide upon
the impressions he received, when he is giving evidence against a man
standing in the situation of the prisoner, who has so much at stake.
GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2107

The next witness was Mr. Cater; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2108

he states, in the same manner Mr. Anstruther does, what passed
in the lobby of the House; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2109

he tells you of the very conversation which accompanied that Mr.
Bowen spoke to; namely, Lord George Gordon talking to them about their
going or not going away; the very words which were concomitant to those
words about the Mass-house in Scotland; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2110

and yet not one word did he recollect of that aggravating kind of
language.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2111

The three door-keepers are called - GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2112

the question is not put to one of them, because the gentlemen knew what
they would say: GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2113

<paren> for undoubtedly their evidence has been canvassed backwards and
forwards before, and put upon paper, GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2114

otherwise the duty of the officers of the Crown has not been done
<$$paren> GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2115

yet not one of these witnesses has been brought to state to you, that
that obnoxious conversation, which Mr. Bowen states, was held by
Lord George Gordon at the time.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2116

Gentlemen, the testimony of some of the other witnesses has introduced
into the lobby, persons who state themselves not to be connected with
Lord George Gordon; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2117

as that testimony has introduced some, it is not improbable but many
others, of the like description, were there; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2118

it is not only probable that that was the case; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2119

but the testimony of subsequent witnesses state, beyond all controversy,
that was the case; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2120

for Mr. Rainforth, the next witness, whose name meets my eye,
states, that the person who was there, urgent for the repeal, was a man
of a very different description to any of those who accompanied Lord
George Gordon, a Colonel Miles.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2121

Will any man state, that Colonel Miles was one of the Protestant
Association?  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2122

was he not, notoriously, a man of a different description?
GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2123

yet he was the person who harangued, as Mr. Rainforth calls it,
the mob, in the lobby of the House of Commons; and who called out <font>
repeal, repeal!  <$$font> and who seems the very soul of that meeting
so got together.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2124

What then does this prove?  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2125

not that the persons under Lord George Gordon's controul, but men of
a very different description, and under the controul of persons of a
very different description, held that conversation in the lobby which
has been imputed to Lord George Gordon as criminal; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2126

and yet Lord George Gordon is now, by inference, intendment,
suspicion and conjecture, to be made answerable for that guilt which is
specifically, by witnesses, attributed to, and fastened upon other men.
GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2127

Gentlemen, much pains has been used in order to shew, that the members of
two of the bodies of the legislature were interrupted in their journey
down, to attend the national business, by persons brought together,
for that ill purpose, by Lord George Gordon.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2128

In the first place, no interruption of the kind is proved by any body
but one witness; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2129

you are told that Mr. Welbore Ellis was interrupted;
GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2130

why was not he here?  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2131

he was here; GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2132

why not called to prove it true?  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2133

Was it not possible to bring the Bishop of Lincoln here?
GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2134

yet none of these persons are called.  GORDON-1781-2,2,8.2135

A person is called to tell you, somebody told him, he had been told by
another, that the Bishop of Lincoln was <P_2,9> obliged to go out of
his chariot, and his wheels were taken off.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2136

It is not fair; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2137

I do not impute blame to the Attorney General; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2138

for his candour is equal to his abilities; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2139

when I say that, I state him high indeed; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2140

but it is not fair, in a case of this kind, by telling a story,
and wishing the Jury should believe it because the witness <font>
believed <$$font> it, but not knew it, that the Jury should believe,
and have it once impressed in their minds, at an hour when their minds
are harrassed out, and all attention asleep; when it is difficult for the
most attentive to distinguish what is material from what is not material;
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2141

and yet it is by evidence of this kind, and this kind only, that a very
important, possibly the most important feature, in this cause, is to be
laid before you.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2142

In one instance only, is any thing of the kind, by legal evidence,
imputed: GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2143

and that was the case of Lord Sandwich; which was, I observed, <font>
with some eagerness <$$font>, asked after; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2144

and how is that proved?  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2145

Mr. Hyde, the Justice of peace, says, that, when he came there,
Lord Sandwich was hurt in his chariot; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2146

the witness did not tell you by whom he was hurt; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2147

but there were parties there with blue cockades; and persons there not
with the badges of those in St. George's Fields; but men of totally
another description; men not with that mark by which you are told the
Protestant Association were to be distinguished, GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2148

they had red and black flags; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2149

they were men of another description; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2150

it is possible they might be, it is probable they were, a different set
of people; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2151

it is certain they <font> might be <$$font>; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2152

they had not those badges which discriminated the other.
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2153

This, I think, is the whole of the evidence which has been laid before
you on the behalf of the Crown; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2154

and if, upon this evidence alone, you were to retire to consider of your
verdict, dispensing justice with mercy, going upon sober, solid, and
sure ground, giving your verdict, in a manner, for which your minds will
never upbraid you, where you could never ask yourselves whether you had
gone upon conjecture or certainty, I conceive you would think it much,
too much, upon evidence of such kind, to impute to a person who stood
prior to this time, in a situation that little called for suspicion
upon him, who stood in a situation having every thing to expect from
good government, nothing to get by things being thrown into confusion,
anarchy and rebellion.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2155

Upon such evidence, I should think you would conceive it too much to draw
conclusions against him which must lead to the infliction of the last
punishment, which must be the case if high treason is imputed to him.
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2156

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forbear relying much upon that which has <font>
not been proved <$$font> by the other side.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2157

Does it appear, after the many prosecutions that were commenced, that
one single individual, connected with Lord George, or belonging to that
association which he was president of, have ever been found obnoxious
to the laws of the country?  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2158

Has criminal guilt been fastened on any one of them?
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2159

Has one of them been indicted?  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2160

Has one of them been put to hazard?  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2161

Has a crime been imputed to them, legally, in a Court of Justice?
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2162

Gentlemen, it has not; active and anxious as the officers of the Crown
have been; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2163

and it became them well, as far as they could, to investigate enormities
of the kind, that have been so feelingly, and I wish I could not say,
in rather an aggravated manner, stated to you; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2164

it was their duty to drag the offender from the corner in which he lay
concealed, to bare his head in the face of justice, and punish him if
he is guilty; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2165

yet all that anxiety, conducted by great abilities, has not been able to
impute a crime to any one man of the denomination of those Lord George
Gordon was the head of; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2166

if that is so, permit me to submit to you the case upon which I stand.
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2167

I admit that there were enormities committed of so gross, so flagrant a
kind, as to be a reproach to the country; that punishment ought, and did
tread upon the heels of the offenders; that it is impossible for eloquence
much superior to mine, for imaginations much more lively than mine,
to paint these enormities in too high colours.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2168

But it may be supposed, that when a multitude of people, not a mob of
people, were got together, for good, at least, not for illegal purposes,
at least not for traiterous purposes, for that is enough for me, not
for traiterous purposes, if you can suppose that other people , of much
worse principles, and having much worse designs to atchieve {COM:sic},
availing themselves of the meeting of the Association, did get together
from all corners of town, and found that banditti represented to be at
the Sardinian Ambassador's Chapel, and perpetrated the conflagrations
that happened.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2169

How is this to be imputed to Lord George Gordon?  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2170

The Attorney General tells you, if a man turns out a wild beast, he is
guilty of murder, if a man is killed by it.  GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2171

I deny it; GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2172

it is not the law of the land, nor the law of humanity.
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2173

If a man turns a wild beast into a room, where death must necessarily
ensue, no doubt he is as guilty as if a man shot into a croud {COM:sic}
: GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2174

But where a beast is turned out, and the probable consequences will
not be that death will ensue, then is the crime to be imputed to him;
GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2175

it never has been, GORDON-1781-2,2,9.2176

<P_2,10>

there is not a decision, not a <font> dictum <$$font> upon the point.
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2178

I have looked into the place from which the Attorney General supposes
he got his doctrine.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2179

But suppose it was so, GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2180

for God's sake how does that bear upon this point?
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2181

Was Lord George Gordon's Association this wild beast?
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2182

If he had a tame beast in his hand, and another taking occasion from
the tame beast being brought there, lets out a wild beast, will the
Attorney General say that he that leads the tame beast in his hand is
to be answerable because another person opens a place and lets out a
tyger or hyena?  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2183

In the name of common humanity, and common sense, I call upon the counsel
for the prosecution to press the point.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2184

I know they will not: GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2185

If they should, the law would fail them, GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2186

and humanity would fail them also.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2187

I know they will not state it, because it is not the law of the land.
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2188

Lord George Gordon was the President of a Protestant Association;
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2189

an act had passed which gave offence, right or wrong I will not say;
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2190

perhaps my opinion may be it gave causeless ground of offence:
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2191

But God forbid, that because I differ with men in opinions, that
therefore I am to treat them as traitors to the laws of their country.
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2192

It is the happiness of our nation that our laws are not like the laws
of the Medes and Persians; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2193

they are subject to revision, and to be discussed and decided upon
soberly: GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2194

and it is not only the province of Englishmen, but their duty,
if they think there are laws which press upon legal liberty, or if
there are laws which improperly tolerate men whose principles are
hostile to the constitution, to petition for a review of such laws.
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2195

I do not say that that is the case of the law which gave rise to the
Association; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2196

but if they think so, they have a right to ask Parliament, that the
matter should be decided upon; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2197

and if the wisdom of Parliament think it ought to be repealed, they have
a right to ask for the repeal.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2198

With these principles, which I never will disavow, which no man will
state to you to be unconstitutional principles, this Association met;
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2199

and after some time, for they had an existence long before Lord George
Gordon was called in; but thinking well of him from his character,
I presume, being a man of blameless life and conversation, a man not
mixing in the vices of this age, a man irreproachable in his moral and
religious walk too - They thought that having such a man at their head
would give weight to their deliberations, and that such a man, if he
carried their request to the foot of the throne, would be attended to as
a man of moral conversation and religious life ought to be attended to.
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2200

- Whether these were the motives that weighed with them, or not, I do
not know; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2201

but some motives, however, did induce them to invite him to sit at the
head of that Association.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2202

He went with them, GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2203

conversed with them; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2204

he told the House of Commons he had been sitting with men of such
description; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2205

he was told that his petition would have no weight; that there were
forged names to it: GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2206

he was told that other petitions had been treated with neglect, and that
the names he should bring were forgeries.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2207

He knew the uprightness of his own intentions, GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2208

and was conscious of the falsity of that aspersion;
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2209

for it was a foul aspersion indeed; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2210

and it belonged to him to take away all possibility of doubt on the
imputation of forgery, in order that those who were to judge of this
Petition, might be informed whether it contained the wishes of such a
number of people; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2211

for that reason Lord George Gordon wished the Petitioners might attend
him to the House of Commons: GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2212

But how were they to come?  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2213

Were they to have banners flying, and be arrayed for war?
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2214

for the language that has been used to you, conveys every idea short
of that.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2215

The word <font> array <$$font> was not so often thundered in your ears,
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2216

and <font> columns <$$font> and <font> divisions <$$font>, and <font>
marching under banners <$$font>, was not a language used for no purpose.
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2217

Witnesses do not describe actions which passed in those words, which it
appears were not used, without some purpose; GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2218

and when that same purpose can only be a bad purpose, because it distorts
the facts beyond their ordinary force; I say then you must suspect the
whole of the evidence.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2219

- But I was turned a little on one side from what I was disposed to say
to you.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2220

How were these people brought together?  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2221

were they brought together in military array?  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2222

It has not been suggested.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2223

It is true, an Officer of the military association from the city of
London told you that he met some of these people with sticks, cutlasses,
musquets.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2224

But were those any of the parties who were in Saint George's fields?
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2225

had they any such things?  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2226

They were ordered to be there at ten o'clock in the morning:
GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2227

the reason that was given why they were to meet so early, was, it was
an hour no drunken people would mix with them.  GORDON-1781-2,2,10.2228

That no offence might be given, it was desired that no stick might be
in their hands; that they would come in their best clothes; and, in
order that they might be known from other persons, that they would have
their blue cockades; <P_2,11> that they would be in certain divisions,
in order that those who were in one part, might know their fellows, and
be known by them; in order that if any strangers committed any outrage
and excess, they might be singled out, and delivered over to the civil
power, to be punished; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2229

and in order that there might be no riot and confusion when the
petition was delivered, they were ordered to go round London bridge.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2230

In the mean time the petition was delivered, GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2231

they came through the city: GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2232

in the course of that journey, when people routinely inclined would
hardly have missed an opportunity to riot; you do not find the least
excess, not the least violation of good behavior imputed to them.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2233

But if you shall find that before they arrived there, another mob,
not belonging to them, were got together; if you shall find that the
avenues of the House of Commons were got in possession by others;
if you shall find that excesses were committed; if you shall find, in
confirmation of the testimony given you by the witnesses you have already
heard, that men of another description, of Colonel Miles's description,
were there; where then is the great imputation on Lord George Gordon?
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2234

I do not tell you that this business was not fit for the most sober and
solemn enquiry.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2235

Most undoubtedly, it was behoveful for government that it should be
enquired into: GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2236

but it would be a libel upon Government to suppose that guilt should be
affixed to that man to whom it does not belong.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2237

- Sufficient for every man are his own offences.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2238

- If other men have been guilty of a violation of the laws of the country
, these violations are not to be placed to the reckoning of Lord George
Gordon.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2239

But excesses were committed, GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2240

and were committed in other parts of the town; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2241

and Lord George Gordon has, say the Gentlemen, by his subsequent acts,
taken to himself, has adopted these excesses; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2242

and I am sorry to see by what medium of proof that is made out; by no
single act of Lord George Gordon's, but that he signed what is called
a protection.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2243

You will be struck with wonder and astonishment when you hear how that
happened: GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2244

Lord George Gordon, alarmed and filled with consternation at the riots
which had taken place in the town, finding that the blame was imputed
to him, and wishing to shew all the alacrity which man could shew to
get rid of the imputation if he possibly could, desired that he might
have access to his Sovereign; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2245

it will be proved to you that he went to the Palace;
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2246

the Secretary of State will be called, who will state to you Lord George
Gordon's application; that he came humbly to throw himself at the feet of
the throne, professing his own innocence; but sorry from the consequences
that were supposed to result from acts of his: GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2247

He had not access to his Sovereign, GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2248

I do not know that he has any reason to complain, GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2249

but he was told that he ought, as a test of his loyalty, to
go into the city, and see if he could do any thing to stop it.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2250

When he went into the city, how did he go?  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2251

Did he go at the head of, or mix with, the mob?  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2252

instead of that, he went with one of those who are conservators of peace,
a magistrate of high authority in the city of London, Mr. Sheriff
Pugh; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2253

in company with that magistrate, he was going to effect, as far as he
could, that which he was ordered to effect as a test of his loyalty.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2254

A person came to him GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2255

and told him, if a note, which he brought to him, was signed by him,
it might have a good effect.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2256

Suppose he had refused to sign it, GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2257

I am sure it would have bore hard upon him; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2258

it would have been said, a person having a house, inhabited by a Roman
Catholic, applied to him to use his supposed influence, that it would
be doing him a good turn, and he refused it: GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2259

He felt it his duty to attempt it; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2260

if he had refused it, and if that argument had been urged against
him, I should have found some difficulty in turning the edge of it;
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2261

but when what he did on that occasion is to bring upon his shoulders
all the violence that was committed in the city, when by this he is to
be supposed to have adopted the acts of the miscreants who committed
all the enormities you have heard of, and to acknowledge that he was
connected with those men, in my apprehension, that evidence is strained
much beyond its fair import.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2262

It seems to me, that that is the only medium of proof by which
he is attempted to be affected as to what passed in the City,
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2263

I am sure it will not be laid much stress upon, because I know it ought
not; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2264

and, in a case of this kind, things are not to be strained beyond their
proper import.  GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2265

I know it ought not to be urged against him that, at several
days distance, people with blue cockades committed violences.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2266

You, yourselves, surveyed the town; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2267

you know that men, of all denominations and descriptions, used blue
cockades; GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2268

you know that there walked about the city banditties, different,
in all respects, from this association, that robbed and plundered;
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2269

women have been executed for these riots, GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2270

but it is not pretended that they were of the association.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2271

It is by inference and intendment that you are to fix this guilt.
GORDON-1781-2,2,11.2272

<P_2,12>

Gentlemen, I have opened to you as much as seems necessary to open,
of the case of Lord George Gordon.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2274

I have made those observations which occurred to me on the case laid
before you for the Crown.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2275

Gentlemen, from your own knowledge in the discharge of your duty, you
know that in this case the facts are to be made out, the guilt to be
ascertained beyond all doubt.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2276

It is not at hazard that men are to be convicted of such offences:
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2277

You are to separate one transaction from the other, and to see how far
each separately goes: GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2278

You are not to bundle them together, and see whether that bundle of
nothing makes out something.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2279

Juries must see that there is ground upon which they go, carrying
conviction to their minds that the imputed guilt is proved.
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2280

If that is not made out to your satisfaction, however your passions may
be warmed by what you saw in those calamitous days, you will, I am sure,
divest your minds of these circumstances: GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2281

You come to this trial with minds totally clear and impartial:
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2282

You bring into Court no knowledge nor suspicions upon the subject,
which are to influence your judgment: GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2283

You come here to attend to the evidence given, attending at the same
time to the oaths you have taken, GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2284

you are to decide upon the evidence, GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2285

you are to say whether Lord George Gordon is guilty or not guilty.
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2286

I know that I speak to men of character and station in the world, and
of good sense; and who know that their duty is to do justice; and know
at the same time that every favourable construction is to be made in
behalf of the Prisoner.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2287

That has always been the language of Courts, GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2288

and will be the language of this Court this day.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2289

Under these observations I shall call a few witnesses; and hope you
will in the result find that Lord George Gordon, whatever blame or fault
may be imputed to him, is not guilty of High Treason with which he now
stands charged.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2290

Mr. Erskine.  My Lord, I mean to reserve my address to the
Jury till after the witnesses for the prisoner have been called.
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2291

There is a precedent for it in the state trials; GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2292

and I take it for granted, that Lord George Gordon will be indulged in
every thing that any man has been since the Statute of King William.
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2293

<font> Court <$$font>.  As far as I am concerned in it, I shall be very
glad to hear you at any stage, when it is most desirable to yourself.
GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2294

Mr. Attorney General.  I am sure no objection will be made on
the part of the Counsel for the prosecution.  GORDON-1781-2,2,12.2295

<P_2,13>

Evidence for the Prisoner.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2298

<font> The Rev. <$$font> Erasmus Middleton <font> sworn;
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2299

Examined by Mr. <$$font> Erskine.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2300

<$$heading>

<font> Q. <$$font> You are a clergyman of the church of England?
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2302

<font> A. <$$font> I am.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2303

<font> Q. <$$font> And, I believe, a member of the Protestant
Association?  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2304

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2305

<font> Q. <$$font> Are you pastor of any church?
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2306

<font> A. <$$font> I am Lecturer of St. Bennet's
Gracechurch-street, and St. Helen's, Bishopsgate-street.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2307

<font> Q. <$$font> How long have you been a member of the
Protestant Association?  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2308

<font> A. <$$font> From some time in February 1779.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2309

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you attend the meetings held by that
Association, previous to the delivery of the petition to Parliament?
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2310

<font> A. <$$font> I did.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2311

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you attend them regularly?
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2312

<font> A. <$$font> Yes; regularly.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2313

<font> Q. <$$font> Was you a member of the committee?
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2314

<font> A. <$$font> I was.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2315

<font> Q. <$$font> State to the Court and the Jury, beginning at
that time, all that you saw and heard at these meetings of the Protestant
Association, previous to the delivery of the petition, when Lord George
Gordon was present.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2316

Give an account of the constitution of the Association, and its
object previous to the time Lord George Gordon became president of it.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2317

<font> A. <$$font> The Association was formed some time in February
1778, in consequence of a bill brought into the House of Commons by
Sir George Savile; to repeal certain penalties against the papists;
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2318

a few persons met at Coachmaker's Hall, in Foster-lane, Cheapside,
in the same month of February.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2319

<font> Mr. Attorney-General.  <$$font> What is it you are reading?
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2320

<font> A. <$$font> Some notes respecting dates and times.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2321

<font> Q. <$$font> When did you make them?  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2322

<font> A. <$$font> I really $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2323

<font> Q. <$$font> Lately?  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2324

<font> A. <$$font> No; I made them from time to time as they
occurred.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2325

The Association met from time to time in order to oppose the growth
and increase of popery, by publishing little books, and by making
enquiries into the schools, and the increase of those schools;
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2326

and they agreed, that this Association should be open to all protestants
and protestant ministers; and they should meet quarterly, in the months
of July, October, January, and April.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2327

Several public meetings were held, and several resolutions come to of
that nature, of publishing books.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2328

The Lord Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry was requested to permit
two sermons of his Lordship's to be printed for that purpose.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2329

His Lordship declined that, looking upon it, that if they were taken out
of the connection in which they stood, they would not be so serviceable as
some others which his Lordship recommended to us of Archbishop Secker's ,
Tillotson, and others.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2330

We then printed one of Bishop Gibson's letters in his Pastoral Care,
and some other little things, GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2331

and dispersed them abroad; GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2332

we likewise wrote an Appeal to the Public, which was published on the
5th of November, 1779.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2333

On the 12th of November, 1779, we wrote a letter soliciting Lord George
Gordon to become our president; GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2334

his Lordship condescendingly acceded to our petition,
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2335

and from that time became our honorable president.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2336

In this Association we had all along in our view, as our model, the
Protestant Association in 1696, when the King, with both Houses of
Parliament, the Bishops and Clergy, signed it, and his Majesty King
William III. proposed it should be lodged in the Records of
the Tower.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2337

His Lordship first met us in the committee about three or four days after
he had condescended to become our president.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2338

<font> Court.  <$$font> It $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be material to go
through the history of your meetings, but only what is relative to
this petition.  GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2339

<font> A. <$$font> I can only mention his Lordship's conduct,
publick and private, throughout the business of the Association.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2340

His Lordship demeaned himself every way in the most loyal affectionate
manner: GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2341

for my own part, I must confess I watched over his Lordship's conduct
and conversation with a degree of jealousy, knowing that we were
ourselves all well known to one another, the committee well attached
to our present sovereign and constitution, and that we were resolved to
give nor allow any speech or conversation that should tend in the least
to reflect upon any people whatever, and particularly administration.
GORDON-1781-2,2,13.2342

His Lordship appeared always the most calm and dispassionate of any one
of us, from all <P_2,14> I could ever learn; GORDON-1781-2,2,14.2343

and, as I said before, I looked at his Lordship at all times with a kind
of jealousy.  GORDON-1781-2,2,14.2344

I never could discover that his Lordship had any other design or end
in view, but simply that which we had in view, the Protestant interest
, and by all legal and constitutional means to petition the House of
Commons to repeal, or to explain that Act, according to our petition.
GORDON-1781-2,2,14.2345

In all private conversation I have ever had with his Lordship, he always
expressed the warmest attachment of affection and loyalty to the King,
the constitution, and the Protestant interest; GORDON-1781-2,2,14.2346

we looked upon ourselves as happy in having his Lordship as our president
, not only on account of his rank, but on account of his good moral
character and of his abilities.  GORDON-1781-2,2,14.2347
