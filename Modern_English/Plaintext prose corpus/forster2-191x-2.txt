<$$heading>

Dear Masood I enclose money order for the 10$$ + 5.00 fr. that
I owe you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.8

Take it to the central post office FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.9

<paren> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know the address of any other <$$paren>
, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.10

and present it, with your visiting card - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.11

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} the way I do it at least.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.12

Also give my name if asked.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.13

Let me know if $you $'re {TEXT:you're} running short of money.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.14

I know that you have been sending some to a friend.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.15

I can easily let you have some, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.16

and indeed debated whether I should make this money order out for a
larger sum, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.17

but $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a bore to be lent money before $you $'ve
{TEXT:you've} said you want it, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.18

so I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.19

Many thanks for the Xmas cards.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.20

We all three thought them so pretty.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.21

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} awfully good of you to think of giving me a birthday
present.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.22

I am looking forward to it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.23

Even more important is it that you let me know what day you return
to England.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.24

We $must $n't {TEXT:mustn't} quarrel about sentiment!
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.25

We agree that it is the greatest thing in the world,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.26

and only differ as to how $it $'s {TEXT:it's} to be made the most of,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.27

and while I was reading your letter I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} even differ.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.28

Who wrote'Each time that thou goest out of my sight -'?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.29

It is very beautiful.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.30

We had a quiet but orthodox Xmas.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.31

Did you buy a plum pudding?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.32

I am also anxious to know the result of your battle with <font> Madame.
<$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.33

If you <font> $hav $n't {TEXT:havn't} <$$font> fought, my advice is <font>
$do $n't {TEXT:don't}, <$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.34

for the sum is small, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.35

she seems very kind, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,100.36

and furthermore you $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} recapitulate the terms, or
make her repeat them after you, before you took <P_1,101> possession of
the rooms, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.37

and so the thing was not fixed up very tightly.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.38

I was a little nervous when I found you $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't},
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.39

and if $it $'s {TEXT:it's} only 3.50.  more per week than you
expected, I think $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} come off pretty well.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.40

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} forget the big <font> Rubens, <$$font>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.41

& take your history book with you when you look at them.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.42

As for Versailles, go in the middle of the day FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.43

and have - or take - lunch there, so that you may get a good light:
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.44

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} not much good making expeditions in the afternoon,
this time of year.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.45

St Cloud might also be useful to you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.46

Do you know how to scan French poetry?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.47

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} a rule $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} meant to tell you of
: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.48

Final e-mute counts as a syllable, though it $must $n't {TEXT:mustn't}
be pronounced.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.49

Les sanglots longs...  = 4 syllables FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.50

Blessent mon coeur =""{COM:4_syllables} FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.51

D'une langueur {COM:footnote_omitted} =""{COM:4_syllables}
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.52

All these lines are <paren> metrically <$$paren> of the same length.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.53

But when the e mute comes before another word beginning with a vowel,
or comes at the end of a line, it $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} count.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.54

A` la tre`s bell <paren> e <$$paren>, a` la tre`s cher <paren> e <$$paren>
= only 8 syllables.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.55

To Syed Ross Masood FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.59

Weybridge.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.60

14 January 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.61

<$$heading>

Dearest boy I am just back from a harassing day; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.63

on my arrival this morning we had lunch FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.64

and all three went off to Putney in a beastly motor that bumped and
stank FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.65

and gave us head-aches.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.66

However, it was a great thing for my grandmother, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.67

and we left her well and safe at her house.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.68

Then we went on to a long tea party at my aunt's near {COM:sic}, and
then up to Waterloo again, and then down to Weybridge with more people ;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.69

and now would to God I was just arriving at 82, and beginning to talk
to you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.70

This letter is to do instead - not that it will.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.71

Well, you know that I was happy with you, and $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} no
need to say it, and that I think Ste Genevieve most beautiful and most
beautifully framed as does my mother.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,101.72

But you ought not to have spent such a pot of <P_1,102> money over me.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.73

- I know this will make you cross, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.74

but you $ought $n't {TEXT:oughtn't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.75

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} far too good for me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.76

I write looking at it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.77

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} a pity the glamour went off Paris.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.78

But nothing influences one so much as fright, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.79

and with your experience, I should have felt the same.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.80

Perhaps you $are $n't {TEXT:aren't} fair to the French.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.81

They have an interest in human capabilities and in ideas that may be
often applied wrongly but is in itself essentially good, and civilised.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.82

When M. Constantine said that his countrywomen had beautiful
legs he was better than the English, who pretend that women have no
legs at all!  Though best of all are those who take legs for granted.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.83

I meant to have asked more about the man in whose face you threw the
change.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.84

It was a risky thing to do.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.85

Did you actually hit him with it?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.86

Good night.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.87

I am sorry that I fidgeted about the train, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.88

but it would have been grave to miss it, as it would have upset my mother
and grandmother, and thrown out their plans.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.89

Give my best remembrances to your two companions.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.90

I was so glad to see them both again.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.91

I did enjoy stopping with you immensely.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.92

Good night again.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.93

from Forster, member of the Ruling Race to Masood, a nigger.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.94

And let the latter buck up and write.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.95

And let him have a good time at Oxford.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.96

And let him and all his be happy.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.97

Otherwise: Forster will never travel in the same railway carriage with
him again.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.98

Reynolds House, 47 Leicester Square <bracket> London <$$bracket>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.103

20 January 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.104

<$$heading>

Dear Malcolm I began a line to night, in spite of incessant chatter
close to my ear on the subject of art and that.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.106

You praise me for my generosity in writing, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.107

but how far you have left me behind - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.108

two long & delightful letters, and three articles are all on my mind.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.109

So female suffrage leads to polyandry -!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.110

I did so enjoy both - and enjoy and approve of the first.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.111

<paren> This is not to imply that I disapprove of the second <$$paren>.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.112

The fair at Rampur also charms me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,102.113

Thank you so very <P_1,103> much for it, and for sending the other two.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.114

The idea of the hill country that you convey to me is grandeur with peace.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.115

Is that right?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.116

Since reading your letters & the articles I have supposed myself to feel
at home there.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.117

The Alps and other mountains that I know feel like boundaries -
barriers between two countries rather than worlds by themselves -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.118

but the Himalayas, partly from their size, partly from their
construction - can hardly give the sense of anything behind, across,
them - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.119

they must feel like the'sea that ends not till the world's end'.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.120

May I see them before I die - the gorge of the Sutlej in particular.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.121

You have given me tremendous pleasure.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.122

I can only write for a little, having as usual put things off till
next day.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.123

I had the luck to find your mother and sister in the other day -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.124

they both seemed well.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.125

So am I.  And happy if it were not for politics.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.126

The German scare and snobbery seem doing their worst,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.127

and the appeals this election are made to lower instincts, than
heretofore.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.128

Dishonest, illiberal, the spirit of the petty tradesman, who $does
$n't {TEXT:doesn't} mind if $he $'s {TEXT:he's} found out to morrow,
so long as he cheats you today - $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the spirit of
both sides as it appears to us: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.129

and I have continually to remind myself that there must be honest
effort & conviction somewhere, hidden behind the froth of either party.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.130

What a rotten letter!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.131

But I want to greet you in the spirit, and accept that though the words
are worthless.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.132

I will write again - by next mail - and tell you all about Paris, where
I have been with Masood.  Also about India.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.133

I am reading two books on it at once, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.134

and expect to be most helpful to you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.135

Meanwhile tell me a little more about it yourself.

Holmleigh, Salisbury.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.142

10 February 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.143

Dear Malcolm I owe you a letter oh this long while.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.144

I left off the last saying that I was going to tell you something special
in the next, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.145

and now for the life of me I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} remember what it is.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.146

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} a comment on our civilisation.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.147

This reminds me: of my story being read to the Rajah.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,103.148

<P_1,104>

Well I never!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.150

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know why it should make me smile,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.151

but it does.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.152

That he, sitting in the heart of poetry, should tolerate it seems odd.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.153

Perhaps he would think it odd to read a book about Indian Art, as I have
been doing - by Havell.  A little petulant in tone, but fascinating.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.154

Have you ever been to Sanchi?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.155

It $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} look far from Dewas on the map.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.156

This letter is already getting scrappy, as is the way with mine.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.157

Yours really do tell something, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.158

and the description of Dewas and of the way thither is so clear that I
could get there with my eyes shut.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.159

The yogi must have been wonderful.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.160

I expect that to you two such an attitude seems steadily beautiful.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.161

Or do you have your moments of repulsion and think'What shall it
profit a man to gain his own soul, if he lose the whole world?
'FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.162

It is curious how one's little feelings are connected with the immense
past, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.163

for I am sure that the repulsion of which I speak is our heritage from
Graeco-Roman civilisation.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.164

Logically, the yogi must be right.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.165

Wealth, success, friendship, love, are all one illusion,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.166

and reality, <paren> whatever it may be <$$paren> is obscured by them.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.167

But in practise one shrinks from this conclusion.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.168

The Western world, and in particular the Latin races, have too vivid a
sense of surface-values.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.169

How wonderful - and how comforting - that the yogi should be illogical
at the last moment too!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.170

I thought of you yesterday, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.171

for between the hours of 6.50, and 8.19.  I made great friends
with the man who was sitting opposite me in the railway carriage;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.172

and I think you can do that.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.173

We actually exchanged cards, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.174

and think what a wrench that is for English people - not but what he
was Irish which accounts for the whole affair.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.175

If I say that our literary, political, and social judgments concurred,
you will think we were a pair of prigs, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.176

but really he was as different to me as possible,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.177

so at the most there was only one.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.178

I do not <font> think <$$font> he will pick my pocket or murder me -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.179

in the British mind there always lurks this fear -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.180

and this morning I have written to him suggesting a meeting in London.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.181

If it ever comes off, I will tell you about it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.182

He was a very charming fellow on the surface, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.183

and $there $'s {TEXT:there's} no reason he $should $n't {TEXT:shouldn't}
be further down.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.184

Now I am in the train again returning to London.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.185

No prospect of life long friendship here.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.186

My companions are two soldiers, who will not talk to each other so it
is not likely that they will talk to me, and a young lady with the wings
of many blue birds in her hat.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.187

The train is just going over Wiltshire Gap at a frightful lick
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.188

and I am writing very well considering.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.189

The sky is grey, the earth brown.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.190

The only approach to colour is in the valleys, whose green is ruled with
the silver lines of the irrigation: and in the cuttings, where the chalk
is eternally white.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.191

Here is Andover.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.192

The nicer of the two soldiers has got out, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.193

and it has begun to rain.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,104.194

<P_1,105>

I dined with Thompson lately.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.196

He tells me that J. Moorsom is well.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.197

Have you heard from him?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.198

Cole I met for a second not long ago.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.199

He has been a recluse since his marriage.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.200

Speaking generally, our mutual friends seem all right.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.201

Dickinson asked me to go to Italy with him this Easter,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.202

but I $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.203

He has been electioneering, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.204

and I ought to have done the same, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.205

but do dread it, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.206

and am so ignorant and incompetent.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.207

Hilton Young stood against Austen Chamberlain.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.208

He was defeated heavily, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.209

but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what he expected.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.210

It may have been satisfactory to him.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.211

I am just going to tea with another vanquished Paladin in the shape
of Sir Frederick Pollock - or rather with his wife & daughter & Sydney
Waterlow, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.212

for I do not expect the warrior himself will be there,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.213

and when he is he always frightens me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.214

Oh I almost forgot.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.215

I have <font> not <$$font> sent Lady Low a card about the O

I really $can $not {TEXT:cannot}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.217

I only inflicted the story on you because we had talked about the
Mechanical together.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.218

There is no reason that a perfectly innocent person should suffer.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.219

<$$heading>

Tyn-y-Gamdda, Llanfair, Harlech, Wales FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.226

2 April 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.227

Dear Lady Ottoline I am here, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.228

and on Friday go to Italy for a month.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.229

I would like very much to come & see you when I return,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.230

and wish that it could be earlier.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.231

It is most kind of you to ask me: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.232

I will write & suggest myself.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.233

I am reading Les Fre`res Karamazov, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,105.234

but am so far a little <P_1,106> disappointed.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.235

It seems sketchy, though I have no notion what I mean by that useful word;
not'insincere'by any means.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.236

- But criticism, or rather critics, are such nonsense:
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.237

their nerves are upset by half a sentence, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.238

and they $have $n't {TEXT:haven't} the peculiar will power to put
them right.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.239

$Has $n't {TEXT:Hasn't} the reception of'Chantecler'been humiliating -
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.240

all the literary people had wrought themselves into such a state that
disappointment was certain.  - And so myself after reading Crime and
Punishment.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.241

But Dostoieffskie always makes one feel'comfortable'- again difficult
to define.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.242

Tolstoi $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.243

Henry James does.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.244

George Meredith $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.245

Swinburne does.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.246

Browning $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.247

There certainly are'dears'in literature, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.248

and a man may <bracket> be <$$bracket> a dear in any line,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.249

and it has nothing to do with niceness or the drawing room table.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.250

But whether it has anything to do with literature -.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.251

I have been muddling round this point for some time now,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.252

but $can $n't {TEXT:can't} get it clearer.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.253

Again thanking you, and with many regrets: Yours very sincerely E.
M. Forster FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.254

Hugh Meredith, with whom I am staying, & who is also a friend of
Dickinson's, would very much like to see you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.255

Might I bring him some day -?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.256

In a hotel Baveno, Lake Maggiore FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.261

<bracket> 15 April 1910 <$$bracket> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,106.262

Dear Malcolm I received your letter with even greater pleasure
than usual, as the <P_1,107> news Hasluck told me made me uneasy.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.263

Being first in Wales, and then here, I had not the opportunity of calling
at Green Street, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.264

& though Hasluck's second letter was so far reassuring that the subject
was not mentioned, I am more glad than I can say to be reassured properly.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.265

I hope I shall soon hear again: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.266

what a wretched time you must both have had: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.267

my love to you both.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.268

We have been here a week, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.269

and if a note of petulance creeps into my remarks, put it down
to the rain, which has continued without a break for 60 hours.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.270

'Non semper imbres -'FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.271

, & it promises to clear now.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.272

The place is glorious, though the beauties are a trifle well ordered
, or seen from a somewhat well ordered foreground perhaps, as we
are entirely surrounded by English people mostly of middle age.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.273

A curate, who is almost too stupid to be alive, is close to me,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.274

& pointing out waterfalls to him is his wife, who is haughty & cautious,
& not sure whether my mother & myself will do.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.275

In the hall other guests are making bead necklaces or playing
poker-patience, or deploring the vulgarity of Lloyd George,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.276

and the rest are sleeping.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.277

Has it ever occurred to you that the south coasts of Europe & of Asia
are analogous - three peninsulas, with the chief mountain chain knotted
up at the head of the middle one?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.278

I am accordingly now in the Himalayas, while Dickinson is in Ceylon!
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.279

I should like to have been with him, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.280

but my mother was persuaded to come abroad, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.281

& I am with her - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.282

she is enjoying it, in spite of a bad attack of lumbago.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.283

- I was amused & delighted with your description of your state.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.284

Really you do have - luck I was going to say, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.285

but it is scarcely the word I mean.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.286

I hope that you keep a diary - except that your letters will make up
that deficiency.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.287

You must have seen more than any one of our time at King's.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.288

I like'do Taubacca'as a measure for distance, & the people who have
never heard of the Great White Queen.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.289

We go on - if mother is well enough - to Parma, Pisa, Siena, Florence ,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.290

and get back the end of May.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.291

I am anxious to see Hasluck.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.292

He seems to have had a topping time.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.293

Did I tell you I stopped with Dickinson at Cambridge?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.294

He was in very good form, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.295

and <font> $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <$$font> swallow America, try though
he does.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.296

Your political reading chides me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.297

I ought to, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.298

but continually postpone.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.299

Just now I am enthralled by Gibbon's Autobiography.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.300

There are passages in it that are more than'correct', and on the border
line of beauty.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.301

What a giant he is - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.302

greatest historian & greatest name of the 18=th= century I say;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.303

whether it is his greatness or his remoteness that makes his goings on
with religion so queer I do not know.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.304

That such a nature should be preoccupied at all with it personally
puzzles me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,107.305

It is a sort of jig saw puzzle that he plays with a little when not
occupied with more <P_1,108> important things, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.306

but he genuinely regrets that the pieces will not fit.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.307

Write again soon.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.308

Yours affectionately E. M. Forster FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.309

<$$heading>

West Hackhurst, Abinger Hammer, Dorking FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.314

29 June 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.315

Dear Malcolm A letter, not to say two, should indeed be on its way from
me to you, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.316

but I seem to have done so little lately, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.317

and one that I have begun is left unfinished at home.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.318

This will be an anxious month for you, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.319

and I need not say that my thought & sympathy have been & will be with
you both.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.320

It is terrible to hear of so much discomfort and suffering, though I can
imagine with what courage it has been $borne.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.321

You say that neither of you have been anxious for a child:
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.322

when it comes surely you will feel differently, and realise it is the
greatest of blessings.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.323

Children are so delightful - and something more besides.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.324

I called at Green Street not long ago, in the hopes of gleaning some
news about you both, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.325

but $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}: - the less as Mrs. Darling was then
away at Ober Ammergau.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.326

I was delighted to speak directly to your sister on the subject that I
knew was occupying her mind as well as mine, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.327

but feared that she might think me intrusive, and perhaps resent it in
other ways.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.328

When I am in London again - the end of July - I shall call again.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.329

I am just going to Harrogate for a fortnight - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.330

a horrible & expensive experience, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.331

but my mother has been ordered there for gout, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.332

and if I do not lead her to the waters, will not drink them.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.333

I shall have my work, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.334

and they say the scenery is fine and the invalids genteel,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.335

but I would give up all and the 80 mineral springs thrown in, for one
hour's ride with you in your hills.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,108.336

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} I recollect <P_1,109> Bashar - <paren> though I
spell its name from memory <$$paren> -?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.337

You leave off at an exciting moment.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.338

Were you backed up at Simla FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.339

or did <paren> forget his name <$$paren> manage to get round people there?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.340

To be continued in our next, I hope.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.341

Let me tell you a little about India.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.342

I am reading Manucci's'Storia do Mogor'- a most entertaining book if it
comes your way.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.343

He goes via Persia FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.344

and arrives in time at the court of Shah Jahan, afterwards fighting
against Aurangzebe whom he loathes.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.345

He is so amusing & vivid about the Indian character that I $can $n't
{TEXT:can't} believe $it $'s {TEXT:it's} all lies, though it is said to
be partly.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.346

Now I will tell you about China & Japan.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.347

I have been to Shepherd's Bush, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.348

but was disappointed - the painting huddled away among the commercial
work, & not catalogued.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.349

Then to the $British $Museum, which, with coy dignity, has brought out
<font> its <$$font> Chino-Japanese pictures, and simply knocked Shepherd's
Bush into a cocked hat.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.350

I never imagined such beauty poetry & humour - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.351

at least I knew from specialists they were there,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.352

but never imagined I should see them.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.353

The Chinese things in particular are as easy to love as Fra Angelicos, or
Botticellis - a'fairy walking on the waves'-; the'Paradise of the West'-
gods & goddesses in a bowery garden, even too happy to drink their cups
of tea.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.354

The'garden of the 100 children'who are playing endless games without a
single grown up.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.355

How unlike the"Organised Play"which it was my fate to witness at a
Whitechapel Board School!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.356

I saw Masood yesterday - much flustered about the advancing Missionary
methods -; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.357

but he generally is flustered over something.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.358

He does not mind the old type, who slammed the heathen on the head with
a bible, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.359

but resents the sympathetic person who dons native dress and says Siva is
another and but an imperfect name for Christ.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.360

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.361

What do you think of missions?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.362

I should be grievously sorry if the whole world became Christians,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.363

but within certain limits missions have their value.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.364

E.g.  in Northern Nigeria the missionaries would do something to raise
the population, while the government <paren> if I may judge from a
friend of mine <$$paren> resents all attempts to make the native think
or feel, because it may increase the difficulties of administration.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.365

It is stormy and cold, but beautiful: dog roses, foxgloves, and blue
ancusas in the garden; also strawberries.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.366

I must stop now, & do some work.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.367

With all messages & wishes: Yours affectionately E. M.
Forster.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,109.368

12 August 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.375

Dear Malcolm, This is all splendid.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.376

I was very anxious to hear, and partly knew all you were both going
through.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.377

I am pleased about the baby, of course, and more pleased than I can say
that his coming has made other things better.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.378

He is the future, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.379

& our love for him is still hidden in it: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.380

I never can look beyond the present, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.381

and the present is you two.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.382

I am distressed about your deafness, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.383

& wish you would tell me more about it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.384

Is there discomfort too?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.385

And how is your general health?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.386

I will not let anything go further if you do not wish.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.387

As to being godfather, I have thought it over during the week,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.388

& have decided to say no.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.389

I have only once said yes, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.390

and that was to parents whose atheism was even more pronounced than
my own.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.391

I do thank you both from the bottom of my heart for trusting & honouring
me, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.392

but in spite of possibly seeming ungracious, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
feel that I had better accept.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.393

I hope & think that you will understand.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.394

If I am lucky, when he grows up he will like me FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.395

and I may be of use to him, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.396

but I must leave it there.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.397

<paren> And, outside my family, no grown up person was ever of any use
to me - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.398

what one really wants is a god-brother, not a godfather <$$paren>.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.399

I stopped a night with Hasluck last week, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.400

and saw picture p.c.s.  of India that made my mouth water.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.401

My goodness what a place!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.402

But those Dravidian temples are nightmares.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.403

"Obviously devil worship"says H. FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.404

and they look it, tho'I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} believe they really are.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.405

It is so difficult to imagine any one glorifying what he knew to be Evil
, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.406

and if Satanism was studied carefully <paren> I leave the field open!
<$$paren> it would surely prove to be a revolt - however misguided -
against the conventional ideas of good.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.407

Blake and Carducci are clearly this.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.408

One glance at the fields or the sky ought to prove the non-existence of
spiritual evil.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.409

There is disease or decay, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.410

but they are incidental, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.411

and the spiritual power behind them is either Nothing or Good.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.412

- This is a long cry from Hasluck, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.413

and atheists were ever adiabolists, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.414

so $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go no further.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,110.415

<P_1,111>

Next Sat. I go for the week end to Hilton Young's cottage,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.417

and if the weather holds shall walk away from it on the Monday for
2 or 3 days, or longer if people will give me food and shelter,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.418

but there is something very awful in my appearance when I walk alone,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.419

and very often they $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.420

Ten days later, if weather still holds and various other things go right
, I may walk again under the aegis of E. V. Thompson.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.421

Every one will take me in then.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.422

Do you get any time for reading?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.423

I am taking huge chunks of Mat Arnold.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.424

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} not as good as he thinks, but better than I thought.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.425

His central fault is prudishness - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.426

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} use the word in its narrow sense, but as implying
a general dislike to all warmth.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.427

He thinks warmth either vulgar or hysterical.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.428

Well good night & good-bye {TEXT:good_bye}.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.429

I do hope you understand about the godfatherhood.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.430

To be asked did give me great pleasure.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,111.431

Dear Bob My aunt has not been well enough to have us,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.440

and all our plans have gone to pieces.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.441

I may be walking for a week this month, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.442

but if I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} <paren> & perhaps if I do <$$paren>
should like to come to see you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.443

I will write again shortly.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.444

I am so glad you are all well.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.445

I have just been to stop with E. H. Young near Marlborough

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.454

Does he feel for the stories anything the least approaching enthusiasm?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.455

I know that he wants money, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,112.456

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} believe it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,113.504

Is it likely that the police would at once communicate such a piece of

It is more likely a piece of blackguardism, engineered by the anti-liberal
party.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,113.506

$Morrell lost his seat in the last election, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,113.507

Dear Malcolm I am so pleased to get your second letter,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.520

but its reference to the godfathership makes me write again.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.521

I do trust and think that you will both have understood why I have
refused - how deeply I was moved at your asking, how carefully I thought
it over, how thoroughly I agree with you that it is a grave matter.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.522

I know that I may have put you to incidental inconveniences too,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.523

I $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} be of less use to him than my own official

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,114.528

Promises are too tragic, considering what life is.

Dear Sir Some time ago I heard a rumour that my novel <font> The Longest
Journey <$$font> had been mentioned in the <font> Revue des Deux Mondes.
<$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.600

Naturally I was much pleased, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.601

and tried to find out in which number the criticism had appeared, but
without success.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.602

You can judge therefore what pleasure your letter has given me.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.603

I like the book myself - in the peculiar way in which one does like
one's own work - having feared that it was provincial rather than
intimate, and would only interest the limited circle of my friends.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.604

Leaving aside the high authority of the <font> Revue des Deux Mondes,
<$$font> it does touch me very much that a reader, not an Englishman,
should care for my book more at a second reading than at a first, and
should detect in it a few of the qualities that I prize myself in the
books of others.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.605

I would like to thank you for your letter, and to add that I have never
received a letter that has encouraged me more.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,116.606

You are also kind enough to ask about my other books.

About two years ago I published <font> A Room With a View <$$font>

Of this I am venturing to send you a copy - not to secure a mention
in the <font> Revue des Deux Mondes, <$$font> because it is only too

I may make some slight acknowledgement of the pleasure that your letter

I only hope I may profit by it in the future, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,117.620

Dearest Boy, I was so glad to hear that you were not vexed with me.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.638

It is such a difficult subject FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.639

and we shall not make anything of it until we talk together even more
freely than we have before.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.640

There are two sides to it - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.641

firstly, it is an experience for you; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.642

secondly, you may do good to her.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.643

Now, in this latter side I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think there is any
point at all.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.644

You will not do any good to her.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.645

I am absolutely certain of it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.646

It is not your fault, or hers; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.647

but because you are the age you are, you will always be arousing hopes
of another kind in her.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.648

This is natural.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.649

The only good you can do is indirectly - through men.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.650

Vice can only be suppressed through men.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.651

Tell every one you know that it is a horrible disgusting notion that
love can be bought for money.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.652

The more men believe this, the fewer poor women will be forced into a
life of debauchery and disease.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.653

There is still the other side of the thing, but enough.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.654

I was very thankful to get your letter.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.655

It is making me very happy.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.656

I am engaged all day, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.658

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.659

it $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} a very big clock, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.660

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.661

Because I feel like you, I am sick of the old conventional surroundings
, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.662

and another sight of 47 Leicester Square is more than I can at present
stand.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.663

So meet me where I say, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.664

and if it is fine we will walk, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.665

and if it is cold we will go and have sandwiches somewhere,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.666

and in either case we will pretend it is Constantinople.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.667

I must tell you one more thing.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.668

My book is selling so well that I shall probably make enough money by
it to come to India.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.669

There will not only be an American edition, but a Canadian, and perhaps
a translation into French.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,118.670

I do not tell most people this because they would think I was bragging,

but I know that you will understand, and feel what I feel.

<$$heading>

West Hackhurst, Abinger Hammer, Dorking FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.680

13 December 1910 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.681

Dear Mr. Benson Thank you for your letter, and for the extract
from Mrs. Benson's letter; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.682

I need not say how flattered I felt by them and how much they interested
me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.683

Their tone, though, was much too <font> respectful; <$$font>
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.684

while reading them, I felt as if I had made some serious contribution
to thought or literature, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.685

but I know that I have not.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.686

Thus, I agreed with you that the book is poetical rather than
philosophical.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.687

This sounds arrogant, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.688

but one's confused little mind is visited by impulses of beauty, whereas
systematic thought can only come to the mind that is both strong and
orderly.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.689

However, it is great fun writing, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.690

and I am sure I do not want to run myself down!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.691

The house certainly would not appeal so strongly to the idealists;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.692

I had not thought of that.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.693

Indeed, though the supernatural element in the book is not supposed to
be'compulsory', $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} afraid that only those readers who
'take'it, will get through with any ease.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.694

Again thanking you for your encouragement, and for all the trouble you
have taken in writing to me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.695

I remain Yours sincerely E. M. Forster.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.696

It would be a great pleasure to come & see you when I am in Cambridge
next.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,119.697

I have just had a very pleasant visit to her - learning among other

I write with a clinical thermometer in my mouth, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.709

Drops of my blood have gone <paren> at a guinea a piece <$$paren> to

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.714

I think it is all rot, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.715

It will be expensive & depressing, and a real worry to my mother, who
will regard it much too seriously.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.717

Sometimes he $has $n't {TEXT:hasn't}, being a busy man,

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.726

I know he wants to see you if he can.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.727

My mother returns tomorrow.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.728

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think we can imagine at all how unhappy she feels.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.729

We have never yet lost anyone out of the first rank of those whom we love.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.730

I will give her your message.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.731

I am reading Lyall's hand book about the English in India - the sort of
thing I required.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.732

Also have failed to read another of Alice Parin's novels called <font>
Idolatry.  <$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.733

The other I tried was good, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.734

but this is about missionaries & wicked Hindus and most tiresome.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.735

When will you be back from Cambridge?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.736

I think $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a very good idea to be there
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,120.737

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} worry, for God's sake, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.750

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.758

We <paren> Greenwood & I <$$paren> started walking yesterday in a thick

FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.759

It was rather beastly, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.760

for we got right up in a cloud, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.761

and should have lost our way but for having a compass.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.762

We did about 14 miles, arriving for tea.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.763

There were two or three others stopping there, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.764

and one of them, Davies, reminded me that you had introduced him and me
at <font> Le Bourgeois gentilhomme.  <$$font> FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.765

Do you remember?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.766

His face came back to me when he told me.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.767

I liked him extremely.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.768

How much more grown up Oxford men are than Cambridge!
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.769

It is a thing I sometimes $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like in them,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.770

but I liked it in Davies.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.771

He is a clever chap, is he not?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.772

Today G. & I have reached the above pleasing address;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.773

but do not write to it, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.774

for we leave tomorrow; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.775

Westbury, Wincanton, & Sherbourne is probably our route, should your
enfeebled frame be able to open an atlas, and your brain be strong enough
to look at it!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.776

I wish I could go walking with you, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.777

but fear you would not care for it - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.778

you athletic brutes are so slack when it comes to the point:
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.779

it is fragile creatures like myself who take their 15 miles a day for
a week and thrive on it.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.780

This reminds me - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.781

I meant to have said it before - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.782

my aunt wants us to fix some day for your visit to her when you can.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.783

her kind remembrances to you, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.786

& she much wants to see you again.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.787

She was well, though in bed most of the time: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,121.788

it is more comfortable for her <P_1,122> till the weather is settled.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.789

My mother's lumbago is also better; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.790

she is now at Salisbury with Mrs. Aylward.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.791

This makes me easy, and able to enjoy my walk, as I know she is with

Dear Malcolm You have been a slack correspondent lately with reason;
I without.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.810

There is no reason that I should not have written you a long letter
every week, full of wit and body.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.811

I have been thinking of you all, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.812

but that is no excuse, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.813

for it is easy, indeed inevitable, to think of those one loves.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.814

I wish you did not feel parted from your hills; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.815

but $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a feeling that we must all go through.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.816

It is tempting to proceed"But they will come back to us more glorious
for the separation", FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.817

yet I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.818

for hills, whether of earth or of the imagination, are too big to play
cup-and-ball with in this comfortable way.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.819

I write to you for 1$$4 hour; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.820

then I go down to the river, to row my mother & a friend about.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.821

My mother is about the same, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.822

thank you very much.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,122.823

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} persuade her to take a change.

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} so hot that the pen <paren> now that I have taken

We went to town yesterday to see the Russian Ballet, after which
a thunderstorm broke, flooded the streets and the tubes, sopped me
through, and caused Hasluck, who met us at tea, <P_1,123> to take a taxi,
unheard-of {TEXT:unheard_of} portent.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.828

It looks about to do likewise now, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.829

yet I suppose our heat is nothing like yours.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.830

I will now tell you all about Bashahr.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.831

It is a very remarkable place, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.832

and extraordinary figures may be witnessed at the Rampur fair.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.833

The religion of the country is not Buddhism as Mr. Emerson <paren>
an honest but superficial observer <$$paren> supposes, but Di-theism
; there being two supreme gods, the Sutlej and the Kailas, the one
proceeding out of the other.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.834

<paren> Do not confuse Ditheism with Dualism, as was recently done by
the Bishop of Lahore <$$paren>.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.835

The Sutlej consents to an occasional garland of wire rope:
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.836

the Kailas are worshipped without ritual.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.837

There are places in Bashahr that might have dropped out of Switzerland
, and other places that actually have dropped out of the moon - desert
after desert of mountain ranges heaving.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.838

Politics are complicated: FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.839

I will deal with them next time.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.840

Oh and as for some photographs I have received I glanced at them
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.841

but they are very far from giving the spirit of the country,
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.842

let me tell you once and for all!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.843

How much more of this are you going to stand?  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.844

See the results on the human brain, when it is not set to work at files
occasionally; and further more when there is going to be a thunderstorm.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.845

How undignified!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.846

How unworthy of our Island Race!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.847

Let me hasten to reintroduce those photographs properly.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.848

Thank you for them very much.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.849

They gave me a very good idea of Bashahr, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.850

and I am sending them for safe keeping to your mother;
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.851

she also has very kindly lent me some.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.852

By now - or during now, if there is such a phrase - I have taken my

or rather popping, with a maximum of bluster and a minimum of rain.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.854

I have been reading Kipling's child's history of England with mingled

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} a fine conception, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.856

but oh is it necessary to build character on a psychological untruth?
In other words to teach the young citizen that he is absolutely unlike
the young German or the young Bashahri - that foreigners are envious
and treacherous, Englishmen, through some freak of God, never -?
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.857

Kipling and all that school know $it $'s {TEXT:it's} an untruth
at the bottom of their hearts - as untrue as it is unloveable.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.858

But, for the sake of patriotism, they lie.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.859

It is despairing.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.860

How slowly righteousness works up against the tide.

mieux connus en France; on which the <font> New Age <$$font> remarks"
to recommend Forster to the French Nation is to insult its intelligence
; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.863

he simply does not count. "FORSTER2-191X-2,1,123.864

The best novels I have come across in the past year are Rosalind Murray's

They looked at their last gasp when I saw them at the Coronation
Procession - his face bright red, hers white, and both without the

When you have a spare day - only then - do send me some Indian Papers -
the Pioneer, and if possible something Nationalist & semi-seditious.

So I shall <font> not <$$font> help you.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.894

I had much rather overlook your mistakes with a courteous smile.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.895

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} something to be near fine country.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.896

Beastly children!  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.897

Why $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} you turn them into the rain!
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.898

Whether it is something to have the novels of Hardy with you, I doubt.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.899

He is a poet, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.900

and the few novels of his $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} read were unsatisfying.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.901

However serious the edifice, the ground plan of it is farce.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.902

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} a poet <paren> I repeat; having got my previous
sentence rather cockeye <$$paren> - FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.903

and only comes to full splendour in his poems.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.904

In them his narrow view of human, and especially female, character $does
$n't {TEXT:doesn't} matter, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.905

and Wessex and Destiny at last stand clear out of the mist.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.906

- This sounds arrogant, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.907

but it is much quicker to be arrogant; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.908

and even where I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} read Hardy, I have idolatrous
reverence for him.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.909

He is one of the few writers one trusts.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.910

What he said to a friend of mine is very illuminating:
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.911

"I am a very stupid man. "FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.912

He lacks the all-round intelligence that one expects as a matter of course
in this cultivated age - a lack that is often a sign of creative power.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.913

Michelangelo lacked, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.914

so did William S. ; FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.915

Goethe is the only genius who was not stupid.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.916

Malcolm was very entertaining and just about T. H.
and Destiny's clothes in his last letter - received a week ago.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.917

I am writing to him soon.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.918

Meanwhile will you thank him for it and for the Indian Punch.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.919

I had a glorious time in Italy - such weather water and woods.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.920

I was in the Lakes all the time, except for excursions to Milan and
Bergamo, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.921

and managed to keep clear of'resorts'.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.922

When you and Malcolm take your Italian villa, I know which Lake it ought
to be on, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.923

but shall not commit its sacred name to paper.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.924

Much did I bathe, much eat, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.925

and lived in a dream till I fell suddenly into England on Basle station
- hundreds of tourists struggling for half that number of seats on the
midnight train, and shouting that all would be well if the others would
behave like Gentlemen.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.926

The sacred word reechoed loudly.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.927

Eight in the carriage, still chanting it, we started, our legs intertwined
like spillikins, so that if one gentleman moved in the night, all the
other seven woke up.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.928

The train was two hours late, the boat later.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.929

I returned a little discontented to Albion, FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.930

and still long for the beautiful forms of the Italian hills.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.931

Thank you for what you say about my short stories.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.932

I would rather people praised them than anything else I wrote.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.933

But I <font> have <$$font> a tall hat <paren> only used for funerals
however <$$paren>, which shows that one can get the best of both worlds.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.934

If any thing in this letter is unintelligible, remember that it
refers to something in your letter to me, which you have forgotten.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.935

In common fairness, foreign letters ought to <bracket> be
<$$bracket> returned to their writers to elucidate one's reply.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.936

This however I do not intend to do.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,125.937

<P_1,126>

I expect to be at home for some time now, varied by lecturing at
Harrow &ct.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.939

The weather is very cold.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.940

With many thanks Yours ever E. M. Forster.

Harnham, Monument Green, Weybridge FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.946

24 November 1911 FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.947

Dear Brooke I have this moment decided to put all I can remember
of your paper on art into a novel - and as I remember it.
FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.948

You have not to mind.  FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.949

"It will never get written unless. "FORSTER2-191X-2,1,126.950
