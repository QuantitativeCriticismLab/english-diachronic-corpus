CHAPTER II.  DELONEY-E2-P2,26.3

Of <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font> his great wealth
, and number of seruants: and also how hee brought the Queen <font>
Katherin <$$font> one hundred and fifty men prepared for the warre at
his owne cost against the King of Scots at <font> Flodden <$$font> field.
DELONEY-E2-P2,26.4

<$$heading>

Now <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font> beeing a widower,
had the choise of many Wiues, mens daughters of good credit and widowes
of great wealth.  DELONEY-E2-P2,26.6

Notwithstanding he bent his onely like to one of his owne seruants
, whom hee had tried in the guiding of his house a yeere or two:
DELONEY-E2-P2,26.7

and knowing her carefull in her businesse, faithfull in her dealing, and
an excellent good huswife, thought it better to haue her with nothing,
than some other with much treasure.  DELONEY-E2-P2,26.8

And besides, as her qualities were good, so was she of very comely
personage, of a sweete fauour, and faire complexion.  DELONEY-E2-P2,26.9

In the end hee opened his mind vnto her, DELONEY-E2-P2,26.10

and craued her good will.  DELONEY-E2-P2,26.11

The maid <paren> though shee tooke this motion kindly <$$paren> said
shee would do nothing without consent of her Parents.  Whereupon a
Letter was writ to her Father, being a poore man dwelling at <font>
Alesburie <$$font> in <font> Buckinghamshire <$$font>: who being ioyfull
of his daughters good fortune speedily came to <font> Newbery <$$font> ,
where of her master he was frendly entertained: who after hee had made
him good chear, shewed him all his seruants at worke, and euery office
in his house.  DELONEY-E2-P2,26.12

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_28>

When the olde man had seene this great houshold and familie, then hee
was brought into the Ware-houses, some being fild with wooll, some with
flockes, some with woad and madder, and some with broad cloathes and
kersies readie dyed and drest, beside a great number of others, some
stretcht on the Tenters, some hanging on poles, and a great many more
lying wet in other places.  DELONEY-E2-P2,28.15

Sir <paren> quoth the olde man <$$paren> Iwis che zee you bee bominable
rich, DELONEY-E2-P2,28.16

and $ch $am {TEXT:cham} content you shall haue my daughter,
DELONEY-E2-P2,28.17

and Gods blessing and mine light on you both.  DELONEY-E2-P2,28.18

But Father <paren> quoth <font> Iack <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font>
<$$paren> what will you bestow with her?  DELONEY-E2-P2,28.19

Mary hear you <paren> quoth the old man <$$paren> I vaith $ch $am
{TEXT:cham} but a poore man, DELONEY-E2-P2,28.20

but I thong God, $ch $am {TEXT:cham} of good exclamation among my
neighbours, DELONEY-E2-P2,28.21

and they will as zoone take my vice for any thing as a richer mans:
DELONEY-E2-P2,28.22

thicke I will bestowe, you shall haue with a good will:
DELONEY-E2-P2,28.23

because che heare very good condemnation of you in euery place,
therefore $ch $ill {TEXT:chill} giue you twenty Nobles and a weaning
Calfe, DELONEY-E2-P2,28.24

and when I dye and my Wife, you shall haue the reuelation of all my goods.
DELONEY-E2-P2,28.25

When <font> Iack <$$font> heard his offer hee was straight content,
making more reckning of the womans modestie, than her Fathers money.
DELONEY-E2-P2,28.26

So the marriage day beeing appointed, all things were prepared meet for
the wedding, and royal cheere ordained; DELONEY-E2-P2,28.27

most of the Lordes, Knights, and Gentlemen therabout, were inuited
thereunto: DELONEY-E2-P2,28.28

the Bride being attired in a Gowne of sheepes russet, and a kertle of
fine wosted, her head attired with a billiment of gold, <P_29> and her
haire as yellow as golde hanging downe behind her, which was curiously
combd and pleated; according to the manner in those dayes, shee was led
to Church betweene two sweet boyes, with Bride laces and Rosemary tied
about their silken sleeues, DELONEY-E2-P2,29.29

the one of them was sonne to Sir <font> Thomas Parrie <$$font>, the
other to Sir <font> Francis Hungerford <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,29.30

Then was there a faire Bride-cup of siluer and gilt caried before her,
wherein was a goodly branch of Rosemary gilded very faire, hung about
with silken Ribonds of all colours: DELONEY-E2-P2,29.31

next was there a noyse of Musicians that played all the way before her:
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.32

after her came all the chiefest maydens of the Countrie, some
bearing great Bride Cakes, and some Garlands of wheate finely gilded,
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.33

and so shee past vnto the Church.  DELONEY-E2-P2,29.34

It is needelesse for mee to make any mention heere of the Bridegroome:
who being a man so well beloued, wanted no companie, and those of the
best sort, beside diuers Marchant Strangers of the Stilyard, that came
from London to the Wedding.  DELONEY-E2-P2,29.35

The marriage being solemnized, home they came in order as before,
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.36

and to dinner they went, where was no want of good cheere, no lacke of
melodie: DELONEY-E2-P2,29.37

Rhennish Wine at this wedding was as plentifull as Beere or Ale,
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.38

for the Marchants had sent thither ten Tunnes of the best in the Stilyard.
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.39

This wedding endured ten dayes, to the great reliefe of the poore,
that dwelt all about: DELONEY-E2-P2,29.40

and in the ende the Brides Father and Mother came to pay their Daughters
portion: which when the Bridegroome had receiued, hee gaue them great
thankes: DELONEY-E2-P2,29.41

Notwithstanding hee would not suffer them yet to depart:
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.42

and against they should goe home, their sonne in law came vnto them,
saying: Father, and Mother, all the thankes that my poore heart can yeeld,
I giue you for your good will, cost, and curtesie, DELONEY-E2-P2,29.43

and while I liue make bolde to vse me in any thing that I am able;
DELONEY-E2-P2,29.44

and in requitall of the gift you gaue mee with your daughter, I giue you
heere twenty pound to bestowe as you find occasion; DELONEY-E2-P2,29.45

and for your losse of time, and charges riding vp and downe, I giue you
here as much broade cloath as shall make you a cloake and my mother a
holiday gowne, DELONEY-E2-P2,29.46

and when this is worne out, come to mee DELONEY-E2-P2,29.47

and fetch more.  DELONEY-E2-P2,29.48

O my good zonne <paren> quoth the old woman <$$paren> Christs benizon
bee with thee euermore: DELONEY-E2-P2,29.49

for to tell thee true, we had zold al our kine to make money for my
Daughters marriage, DELONEY-E2-P2,29.50

and this zeauen yeare <P_30> we should not haue been able to buy more:
DELONEY-E2-P2,30.51

Notwithstanding wee should haue zold all that euer wee had, before my
poore wench should haue lost her marriage.  DELONEY-E2-P2,30.52

I <paren> quoth the olde man <$$paren> $ch $ud {TEXT:chud} haue zold
my coate from my back, and my bed from vnder me, before my Girle should
haue gone without you.  DELONEY-E2-P2,30.53

I thank you good father and mother, said the Bride, DELONEY-E2-P2,30.54

and I pray God long to keep you in health: DELONEY-E2-P2,30.55

then the Bride kneeled down DELONEY-E2-P2,30.56

and did her dutie to her Parents; who weeping for very ioy, departed.
DELONEY-E2-P2,30.57

Not long after this, it chaunced while our Noble King was making warre
in <font> France <$$font>, that <font> Iames <$$font>, king of Scotland
, falsly breaking his oath inuaded <font> England <$$font> with a great
army and did much hurt vpon the Borders: whereupon on the sodaine euerie
man was appointed according to his abilitie to be readie with his men and
furniture at an houres warning, on paine of death.  DELONEY-E2-P2,30.58

<font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font> was commanded by the
Iustices to set out sixe men, foure armed with Pikes and two Calieuers
, and to meete the Queene in <font> Buckinghamshire <$$font>, who was
there raising a great power to goe against the faithlesse king of Scots.
DELONEY-E2-P2,30.59

When <font> Iacke <$$font> had receiued this charge, hee came home in
all haste, DELONEY-E2-P2,30.60

and cut out a whole broadcloth for horsemens coats, and so much more as
would make vp coates for the number of a hundred men: DELONEY-E2-P2,30.61

in short time hee had made readie fiftie tall men well mounted in white
coates, and red caps with yellowe Feathers, Demilances in their hands,
and fiftie armed men on foot with Pikes, and fiftie shot in white coats
also, euery man so expert in the handling of his weapon, as fewe better
were found in the field.  DELONEY-E2-P2,30.62

Himselfe likewise in compleat armour on a goodly Barbed Horse, rode
formost of the companie, with a launce in his hand, and a faire plume
of yellow feathers in his crest, DELONEY-E2-P2,30.63

and in this sort hee came before the Iustices: who at the first approach
did not a little wonder what hee should be.  DELONEY-E2-P2,30.64

At length when he had discouered what he was, the Iustices and most of
the Gentlemen gaue him great commendations for this his good and forward
mind shewed in this action: DELONEY-E2-P2,30.65

but some other enuying heereat gaue out words that hee shewed himselfe
more prodigall then prudent, and more vaine glorious then well aduised,
<P_31> seeing that the best Nobleman in the Countrie would scarce haue
done so much: DELONEY-E2-P2,31.66

and no maruell <paren> quoth they <$$paren> DELONEY-E2-P2,31.67

for such a one would call to his remembrance, that the King had often
occasions to vrge his subiects to such charges, DELONEY-E2-P2,31.68

and therefore woulde do at one time as they might bee able to doe at
another: DELONEY-E2-P2,31.69

but <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font>, like the Stork in
the Spring time, thinks the highest Cedar too lowe for him to build his
neast in, DELONEY-E2-P2,31.70

and eare the yeare bee halfe done, may bee glad to haue his bed in a bush.
DELONEY-E2-P2,31.71

These disdainefull speeches being at last brought to <font> Iacke
<$$font> of <font> Newberies <$$font> eare, though it grieued him much,
yet patiently put them vp till time conuenient.  DELONEY-E2-P2,31.72

Within a while after, all the Souldiers in <font> Barkshire, Hampshire
<$$font>, and <font> Wilshire <$$font>, were commanded to shew themselues
before the Queene at <font> Stonny Stratford <$$font>, where her Grace
with many Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen were assembled, with tenne
thousand men.  DELONEY-E2-P2,31.73

Against <font> Iacke <$$font> should goe to the Queen, hee caused his
face to bee smeared with bloud, and his white coate in like manner.
DELONEY-E2-P2,31.74

When they were come before her Highnesse, she demanded <paren> aboue all
the rest <$$paren> what those white coates were?  Whervpon Sir <font>
Henery Englefield <$$font> <paren> who had the leading of the <font>
Barkshire <$$font> men <$$paren> made answere: Maie it please your
Maiestie to vnderstand, that hee which rideth formost there, is called
<font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font>, and all those gallant
men in white, are his owne seruants, who are maintained all the yeare by
him, whom he at his owne cost hath set out in this time of extremitie,
to serue the King against his vaunting Foe: DELONEY-E2-P2,31.75

and I assure your Maiesty there is not, for the number, better Souldiers
in the field.  DELONEY-E2-P2,31.76

Good sir <font> Henry <$$font> <paren> quoth the Queene <$$paren>
bring the man to me that I may see him: which was done accordingly.
DELONEY-E2-P2,31.77

Then <font> Iacke <$$font> with all his men alighted, DELONEY-E2-P2,31.78

and humbly on their knees fell before the Queene: DELONEY-E2-P2,31.79

Her Grace said, Gentleman arise, DELONEY-E2-P2,31.80

and putting forth her lillie white hand, gaue it him to kisse.
DELONEY-E2-P2,31.81

Most gratious Queene quoth hee, Gentleman I am none, nor the sonne
of a Gentleman, but a poore Clothier, whose lands are his Loomes,
hauing no other Rents but what I get from the backes of little sheepe,
DELONEY-E2-P2,31.82

nor can I claime any cognisance but a wodden shuttle.  DELONEY-E2-P2,31.83

Neuerthelesse, most gratious Queene, these my poore servants and my
selfe, with life and goods are readie at your Maiesties commaund, not
onely to spend our blouds, but also to lose our liues in defence of our
King and Countrey.  DELONEY-E2-P2,31.84

<P_32>

Welcome to mee <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font>, saide
the Queene, DELONEY-E2-P2,32.86

though a Clothier by trade, yet a Gentleman by condition, and a faithfull
subiect in heart: DELONEY-E2-P2,32.87

and if thou chance to haue any sute in Court, make account the queene
will bee thy friend, DELONEY-E2-P2,32.88

and would to God the King had many such Clothiers.  DELONEY-E2-P2,32.89

But tell mee, how came thy white coate besmeared with bloud, and thy
face so bescratcht?  DELONEY-E2-P2,32.90

May it please your Grace <paren> quoth hee <$$paren> to vnderstand, that
it was my chaunce to meete with a Monster, who like the people <font>
Cynomolgy <$$font>, had the proportion of a man, but headed like a dogge
, the biting of whose teeth was like the poysoned teeth of a Crocodile,
his breath like the Basilisks, killing afarre off.  DELONEY-E2-P2,32.91

I vnderstand, his name was Enuie, who assailed mee inuisibly, like the
wicked spirit of <font> Mogunce <$$font>, who flung stones at men and
could not bee seene: DELONEY-E2-P2,32.92

and so I come by my scratcht face, not knowing when it was done.
DELONEY-E2-P2,32.93

What was the cause this monster should afflict thee aboue the rest of
thy companie, or other men in the field?  DELONEY-E2-P2,32.94

Although most Souereigne Queenb, quoth hee, this poysoned curre snarleth
at many, and that few can escape the hurt of his wounding breath, yet
at this time hee bent his force against mee, not for any hurt I did him,
but because I surpast him in heartie affection to my Souereigne Lord, and
with the poore Widowe offered all I had to serue my Prince and Countrey.
DELONEY-E2-P2,32.95

It were happy for <font> England <$$font>, sayd the Queene, if in euery
market Towne there were a Iybbet to hang vp curres of that kind: who
like <font> Aesops <$$font> dogge lying in the maunger, will doe no good
himselfe, nor suffer such as would to doe any.  DELONEY-E2-P2,32.96

This speech beeing ended, the Queene caused her Army to bee set in order
, and in warlike manner to march toward <font> Flodden <$$font>, where
King <font> Iames <$$font> had pitcht his field.  DELONEY-E2-P2,32.97

But as they passed along with Drum and Trumpet, there came a Post from
the valiant Earle of <font> Surrey <$$font>, with tydings to her Grace,
that now shee might dismisse her Army, for that it had pleased <font>
God <$$font> to grant the noble Earle victorie ouer the Scots: whome
hee had by his wisedome and valiancie vanquisht in fight, and slayne
their King in battel.  Upon which newes her Maiestie discharged her
Forces, and ioyfully tooke her iourney to <font> London <$$font>, with
a pleasant countenance, praysing <font> God <$$font> for her famous
victorie, and yeelding thankes to all the Noble Gentlemen and Souldiers
for their readinesse in the action, giuing many giftes to the Nobilitie,
and great rewards to the Souldiers: among whom shee <P_33> nothing forgot
<font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font>, about whose necke
shee put a rich chaine of gold: at what time he with all the rest gaue
a great shout, saying <font> God <$$font> saue <font> Katherin <$$font>
the noble Queene of <font> England <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,33.98

Many Noble men of <font> Scotland <$$font> were taken prisoners at this
battell, and manie more slaine: so that there neuer came a greater foyle
to <font> Scotland <$$font> $than {TEXT:this} this: DELONEY-E2-P2,33.99

for you shall vnderstand that the Scottish King made full account
to bee Lord of this land, watching opportunitie to bring to passe his
faithlesse and trayterous practise: which was when our King was in <font>
France <$$font>, at <font> Turney <$$font>, and <font> Turwin <$$font>:
in regard of which warres, the Scots vaunted there was none left in <font>
England <$$font>, but shepheards and ploughmen, who were not able to lead
an army, hauing no skill in martiall affaires.  In consideration of which
aduantage, hee inuaded the Countrey, boasting of victorie befor hee had
wonne: which was no small griefe to Queene <font> Margaret <$$font> his
wife, who was eldest Sister to our noble King.  Wherefore in disgrace
of the Scots, and in remembrance of the famous atchieued victorie, the
Commons of <font> England <$$font> made this Song: which to this day is
not forgotten of many.  DELONEY-E2-P2,33.100

CHAPTER III.  DELONEY-E2-P2,35.104

How <font> Iack <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font> went to receiue
the King, as hee went a progresse into Barkeshire: and how hee made him
a banquet in his owne house.  DELONEY-E2-P2,35.105

<$$heading>

About the tenth year of the kings reign, his Grace made his progresse
into <font> Barkshire <$$font>, against which time <font> Iacke <$$font>
of <font> Newberie <$$font> cloathed 30. tall fellowes, being
his houshold seruants, in blewe coates, faced with Sarcenet, euerie one
hauing a good sword and buckler on his shoulder, himselfe in a plaine
russet coate, a paire of white kersie breeches, without welt or gard,
and stockings of the same peece sowed to his slops, which had a great
codpeece, wheron hee stucke his pinnes: who knowing the King would come
ouer a certaine meadow neer adioyning to the Towne, got himselfe thither
with all his men; and repairing to a certaine Ant-hill, which was in the
field, tooke vp his seate there, causing his men to stand round about
the same with their swords drawne.  DELONEY-E2-P2,35.107

The King comming neere the place with the rest of his Nobilitie, and
seeing them stand with their drawne weapons, sent to know the cause.
DELONEY-E2-P2,35.108

<font> Garter <$$font> King at armes was the Messenger, who spake in
this sort.  DELONEY-E2-P2,35.109

Good fellowes, the Kings maiestie would know to what end you stand heere
with your swords and bucklers prepared to fight.  DELONEY-E2-P2,35.110

With that, <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font> started
vp DELONEY-E2-P2,35.111

and made this answere.  DELONEY-E2-P2,35.112

Harrold <paren> quoth he <$$paren> returne to his Highnesse, it is poore
<font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font>, who beeing scant
Marquesse of a mole hill, is chosen Prince of Ants, DELONEY-E2-P2,35.113

and heere I stand with my weapons and Guard about mee, to defend and
keep these my poore and painefull subiects from the force of the idle
Butterflyes, their sworne enemies, least they should disturbe this quiet
Common wealth, who this Sommer season are making their winters prouision.
DELONEY-E2-P2,35.114

The Messenger returning, told his Grace that it was one <font> Iacke
<$$font> of <P_36> <font> Newbery <$$font> that stoode there with his
men about him to guard <paren> as they say <$$paren> a company of Ants,
from the furious wrath of the Prince of Butterflies.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.115

With this newes the King heartily laught, saying: Indeede it is no maruel
hee stand so well prepared, considering what a terrible tyrant he hath
to deale withall.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.116

Certainly my Lords <paren> quoth hee <$$paren> this seemes to bee a
pleasant fellow, DELONEY-E2-P2,36.117

and therefore we will send to talke with him.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.118

The Messenger being sent, told <font> Iack <$$font> he must come speake
with the King.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.119

Quoth hee, his Grace hath a horse, DELONEY-E2-P2,36.120

and I am on foote, DELONEY-E2-P2,36.121

therefore will him to come to mee: DELONEY-E2-P2,36.122

beside that, while I am away, our enemies might come and put my people
in hazard as the Scots did <font> England <$$font>, while our King was
in <font> France <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.123

How dares the Lambe bee so bolde with the Lyon, quoth the Herald?
DELONEY-E2-P2,36.124

Why quoth hee, if there bee a Lyon in the field, here is neuer a cocke
to feare him: DELONEY-E2-P2,36.125

and tell his Maiestie, hee might thinke me a very bad Gouernour
that would walke aside vpon pleasure, and leaue my people in perill.
DELONEY-E2-P2,36.126

Herald <paren> quoth hee <$$paren> it is written, Hee that hath a charge
must looke to it, DELONEY-E2-P2,36.127

and so tell thy Lord my King.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.128

The Message being done, the King sayd: My Lords, seeing it will bee no
other, wee will ride vp to the Emperour of Ants, that is so careful in
his gouernment.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.129

At the Kings approach, <font> Iack <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font>
and his seruants put vp all their weapons, DELONEY-E2-P2,36.130

and with a ioyfull crie flung vp their caps in token of victorie.
DELONEY-E2-P2,36.131

Why how now my masters <paren> quoth the King <$$paren> is your wars
ended?  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.132

Let mee see where is the Lord Generall of this great Campe?
DELONEY-E2-P2,36.133

With that, <font> Iack <$$font> of <font> Newberie <$$font> with all
his seruants fell on their knees, saying: God saue the King of <font>
England <$$font>, whose sight hath put our foes to flight, and brought
great peace to the poore labouring people.  DELONEY-E2-P2,36.134

Trust me <paren> quoth our King <$$paren> here bee pretie fellowes to
fight against Butterflies: DELONEY-E2-P2,36.135

I must commend your courage, that dares withstand such mightie gyants.
DELONEY-E2-P2,36.136

Most dread Soueraigne <paren> quoth <font> Iacke <$$font> <$$paren>
not long agoe, in my conceit, I saw the most prouident Nation of the
Ants, summoned their cheefe Peeres to a Parliament, which was helde in
the famous citie <font> Dry Dusty <$$font>, the one and thirtith day
of September: $where $as {TEXT:whereas}, <P_37> by their wisdomes, I
was chosen their King; at what time also manie billes of complaint were
brought in against diuers ill members in the common-wealth: among whome
the Moule was attainted of high treason to their state, and therefore
was banished for euer from their quiet Kingdome: DELONEY-E2-P2,37.137

so was the Grashopper and the Caterpiller, because they were not onely
idle, but also liued vpon the labours of other men: DELONEY-E2-P2,37.138

amongst the rest, the Butterflie was very much misliked,
DELONEY-E2-P2,37.139

but fewe durst say anie thing to him because of his golden apparell:
who through sufferance grewe so ambitious and malapert, that the poore
Ant could no sooner get an egge into her nest, but hee would haue it
away, and especially against Easter, which at length was misliked.
DELONEY-E2-P2,37.140

This painted Asse tooke snuffe in the nose, DELONEY-E2-P2,37.141

and assembled a great many other of his owne coate, by windie warres to
roote these painefull people out of the land, that hee himselfe might
bee seated aboue them all.  DELONEY-E2-P2,37.142

<paren> These were proud Butterflies, quoth the King.  <$$paren>
DELONEY-E2-P2,37.143

Whereupon I with my men <paren> quoth <font> Iacke <$$font> <$$paren>
prepared our selues to withstand them till such time as your Maiesties
royall presence put them to flight.  DELONEY-E2-P2,37.144

Tush <paren> said the King <$$paren> thou must think that the force of
flies is not great.  DELONEY-E2-P2,37.145

Notwithstanding <paren> quoth <font> Iacke <$$font> <$$paren> their gaie
gownes make poore men afraid.  DELONEY-E2-P2,37.146

I perceiue <paren> quoth Cardinall <font> Wolsey <$$font> <$$paren> that
you being King of Ants, doe carry a great grudge to the Butterflies.
DELONEY-E2-P2,37.147

I, quoth <font> Iack <$$font>, wee bee as great foes, as the Foxe and
the Snake are friends: DELONEY-E2-P2,37.148

for the one of them being subtile, loues the other for his craft:
DELONEY-E2-P2,37.149

but now I intend to be no longer a prince, because the maiestie of a king
hath eclipst my glorie: so that looking like the Peacocke on my blacke
feet, makes mee abase my vain glorious feathers, DELONEY-E2-P2,37.150

and humbly I yeeld vnto his Maiestie all my souereigne rule and dignitie ,
both of life and goods, casting up my weapons at his feete, to doe any
seruice wherein his Grace shall command me.  DELONEY-E2-P2,37.151

God a mercy good <font> Iack <$$font> <paren> quoth the king <$$paren>
I haue often heard of thee, DELONEY-E2-P2,37.152

and this morning I mean to visite thy house.  DELONEY-E2-P2,37.153

Thus the King with great delight rode along vntill hee came to the
townes end, where a great multitude of people attended, <P_38> to see
his Maiestie: where also Queene <font> Katherine <$$font> with all her
traine met him.  DELONEY-E2-P2,38.154

Thus with great reioycing of the Commons, the King and Queene passed
along to this iolly Clothiers house, where the good wife of the house
with threescore maidens attending on her, presented the king with a Bee
hiue, most richly gilt with gold, DELONEY-E2-P2,38.155

and all the Bees therein were also of gold curiously made by Art,
DELONEY-E2-P2,38.156

and out of the top of the same Hiue sprung a flourishing green tree,
which bore golden Apples, DELONEY-E2-P2,38.157

and at the roote thereof lay diuers Serpents, seeking to destroy it , whom
Prudence and Fortitude trode vnder their feet, holding this inscription
in their hands; DELONEY-E2-P2,38.158

{COM:verse_omitted}

The King fauourably accepted this Embleme, DELONEY-E2-P2,38.160

and receiving it at the womans hands, willed Cardinall <font> Wolsey
<$$font> to look thereon, commanding it should bee sent to <font>
Windsor <$$font> Castle.  DELONEY-E2-P2,38.161

This Cardinall was at that time Lord Chauncellor of <font> England
<$$font>, and a wonderfull proude Prelate, by whose meanes great variance
was set betwixt the King of <font> England <$$font> and the French King,
the Emperour of <font> Almaine <$$font>, and diuers other Princes of
Christendome, whereby the trafficke of those Merchants was vtterly
forbidden, which bred a generall woe through <font> England <$$font>,
especially among Clothiers: insomuch that hauing no sale for their cloath,
they were faine to put away many of their people which wrought for them,
as hereafter more at large shall be declared.  DELONEY-E2-P2,38.162

Then was his Maiestie brought into a great Hall, where foure long Tables
stoode readie couered: DELONEY-E2-P2,38.163

and passing through that place, the King and Queene came into a faire and
large Parlour hung <P_39> about with goodly Tapistrie, where was a Table
prepared for his Highnesse and the Queenes Grace.  DELONEY-E2-P2,39.164

All the floore where the king sate, was couered with broadcloathes in
stead of greene rushes: DELONEY-E2-P2,39.165

these were choice peeces of the finest wool, of an Azure colour, valued
at an hundred pound a cloath, which afterward was giuen to his Maiestie.
DELONEY-E2-P2,39.166

The king beeing set with the chiefest of his Councell about him, after a
delicate dinner, a sumptuous Banquet was brought in, serued all in glasse:
the description whereof were too long for mee to write, and you to read.
DELONEY-E2-P2,39.167

The great Hall was also filled with Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen
, who were attended by no other but the seruants of the house.
DELONEY-E2-P2,39.168

The Ladies of Honour and Gentlewomen of the Court were all seated in
an other Parlour by themselues: at whose table the maidens of the house
did waite in decent sort.  DELONEY-E2-P2,39.169

The seruingmen by themselues, DELONEY-E2-P2,39.170

and the pages and foot men by themselues, vpon whom the Prentizes did
attend most diligently.  DELONEY-E2-P2,39.171

During the kings abiding in this place, there was no want of delicates :
DELONEY-E2-P2,39.172

Renish wine, Claret wine, and Sacke, was as plentifull as small Ale.
DELONEY-E2-P2,39.173

Then from the highest to the lowest, they were serued in such sort, as
no discontent was found anie waie, so that great commendations redounded
vnto the Good-man of the house.  DELONEY-E2-P2,39.174

The L. Cardinall that of late found himselfe gall'd
by the Allegorie of the Ants, spoke in this wise to the King.
DELONEY-E2-P2,39.175

If it would please your Highnesse <paren> quoth he <$$paren> but to note
the vaine glory of these Artificers, you should find no small cause of
dislike in many of their actions.  DELONEY-E2-P2,39.176

For an instance, the fellow of this house, hee hath not stucke this
day to vndoo himselfe onely to become famous by receiuing of your
Maiestie: like <font> Herostratus <$$font> the Shoomaker, that burned
the Temple of <font> Diana <$$font>, onely to get himselfe a name,
more than {he_would_have_undone_himself} for any affection hee beares
to your Grace, as may well bee prooued by this: DELONEY-E2-P2,39.177

Let there be but a simple Subsidie leuied vpon them for the assistance of
your Highnesse Wars, or anie other weightie affaires of the Common wealth
and state of the Realme, though it bee not the twentith part of their
substance, they will so grudge and repine, that it is wonderfull; and like
people desperate crie out, They be quite vndone.  DELONEY-E2-P2,39.178

My Lord Cardinall quoth the Queene, <paren> vnder correction of my <P_40>
Lord the King <$$paren> I durst lay an hundred pound <font> Iacke <$$font>
of <font> Newberie <$$font> was neuer of that mind, nor is not at this
instant: DELONEY-E2-P2,40.179

if ye ask him, I warrant hee will say so.  DELONEY-E2-P2,40.180

My self also had a proofe thereof at the Scottish inuasion, at what time
this man, being seassed but at sixe men, brought <paren> at his owne
cost <$$paren> an hundred and fiftie into the field.  DELONEY-E2-P2,40.181

I woulde I had moe such subiects saide the King, and many of so good
a minde.  DELONEY-E2-P2,40.182

Ho, ho <font> Harry <$$font> <paren> quoth <font> Will Sommers <$$font>
<$$paren> then had not <font> Empson <$$font> and <font> Dudley
<$$font> beene chronicled for knaues, or sent to the Tower for treason.
DELONEY-E2-P2,40.183

But then they had not knowne the paine of imprisonment quoth our King,
who with their subtiltie grieued many others.  DELONEY-E2-P2,40.184

But their subtiltie was such that it broke their necks quoth <font>
Will Sommers <$$font>.  Whereat the King and Queen laughing heartily,
rose from the Table.  By which time, <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font>
Newberie <$$font> had caused all his folkes to goe to their worke,
that his Grace and all the Nobilitie might see it, so indeed the Queene
had requested.  DELONEY-E2-P2,40.185

Then came his Highnesse where hee saw an hundred Loomes standing in one
roome, and two men working in euery one, who pleasantly sung in this sort.
DELONEY-E2-P2,40.186

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_42>

Well sung good fellowes, said our King: DELONEY-E2-P2,42.189

Light hearts and merrie mindes liue long without gray haires.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.190

But <paren> quoth <font> Will Sommers <$$font> <$$paren> seldome without
red noses.  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.191

Well, said the King, there is a hundred angels to make good chear withal:
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.192

and looke that euery yeare once you make a feast among your selues,
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.193

and frankly <paren> euery yeare <$$paren> I giue you leaue to fetch
foure Buckes out of <font> Dunnington <$$font> parke, without any mans
let or controulement.  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.194

O I beseech your Grace <paren> quoth <font> Will Sommers <$$font>
<$$paren> let it be with a condition.  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.195

What is that, said our King?  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.196

My Liege, quoth hee, that although the Keeper will haue the skins,
that they may giue their wiues the hornes.  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.197

Goe to, said the Queene, DELONEY-E2-P2,42.198

thy head is fuller of knauerie, then thy purse is of crownes.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.199

The poore workemen humbly thanked his Maiestie for his bountifull
liberalitie: DELONEY-E2-P2,42.200

and euer since it hath beene a custome among the Weauers, euery yeare
presently after <font> Bartholomewtide <$$font>, in remembrance
of the Kings fauor to meete together, and make a merrie feast.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.201

His Maiestie came next among the spinners, and carders, who were merrily a
working: whereat <font> Will Sommers <$$font> fell into a great laughter.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.202

What ayles the foole to laugh, sayd the King?  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.203

Marrie <paren> quoth <font> Will Sommers <$$font> <$$paren> to
see these maidens get their liuing, as buls doe eate their meate.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.204

How is that, said the Queen?  DELONEY-E2-P2,42.205

By going still backward quoth <font> Will Sommers <$$font>:
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.206

and I will laie a wager, that they that practise so well being maides
to goe backward, will quickly learne ere long to fall backward.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.207

But sirra said the Cardinall, thou didst fall forward when thou
brokest thy face in maister <font> Kingsmiles <$$font> cellar.
DELONEY-E2-P2,42.208

<P_43>

But you my Lord sate forward <paren> quoth <font> Will Sommers
<$$font> <$$paren> when you sate in the stockes at Sir <font> Amias
Paulets <$$font>.  Whereat there was greater laughing than before.
DELONEY-E2-P2,43.210

The King and Queene and all the Nobilitie heedfully beheld these Women ,
who for the most part were very faire and comly creatures, and were all
attired alike from top to toe.  DELONEY-E2-P2,43.211

Then <paren> after due reuerence <$$paren> the maidens in dulcet manner
chaunted out this song, two of them singing the Dittie, and all the rest
bearing the burden.  DELONEY-E2-P2,43.212

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_47>

After the Kings Maiestie and the Queene had heard this song sweetely
sung by them, hee cast them a great rewarde: DELONEY-E2-P2,47.215

and so departing thence, went to the Fulling mills, and Dyehouse, where
a great many also were hard at worke: DELONEY-E2-P2,47.216

and his Maiesty perceiuing what a great number of people were by this one
man set on worke, both admired, and commended him, saying further, that
no Trade in all the Land was so much to bee cherished and maintained
as this, which quoth he may well be called The life of the poor.
DELONEY-E2-P2,47.217

And <P_48> as the King returned from this place with intent to take
horse and depart, there met him a great many of children in garments of
white silke fringed with gold, their heads crowned with golden Baies,
DELONEY-E2-P2,48.218

and about their armes each one had a scarfe of green sarcenet fast tyed
, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.219

in their hands they bore siluer Boawes, and vnder their girdles golden
arrowes.  DELONEY-E2-P2,48.220

The formost of them represented <font> Diana <$$font>, goddesse of
Chastitie, who was attended vpon by a trayne of beautifull Nymphes,
DELONEY-E2-P2,48.221

and they presented to the King foure prisoners: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.222

The first was a sterne and grisly Woman, carrying a frowning countenance
: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.223

and her forehead full of wrinkles, her hair as blacke as pitch; and her
garments all bloudie, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.224

a greate sworde shee had in her hand all stayned with purple gore:
DELONEY-E2-P2,48.225

they called her name <font> Bellona <$$font>, Goddesse of warres, who
had three daughters: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.226

the first of them was a tall Woman, so leane and ill fauoured, that her
cheek bones were ready to start out of the skinne, of a pale and deadly
colour, her eyes sunke into her head: her legges so feeble, that they
could scantly carrie the body, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.227

all along her armes and hands through the skin you might tel the sinowes,
ioyntes, and bones: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.228

her teeth were very strong and sharpe withall: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.229

shee was so greedy that shee was readie with her teeth to teare the skin
from her owne armes: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.230

her attyre was black, and all torne and ragged, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.231

shee went bare footed DELONEY-E2-P2,48.232

and her name was <font> Famine <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,48.233

The second was a strong and lustie Woman, with a looke pittilesse,
and vnmercifull countenance: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.234

her garments were all made of Iron and Steele, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.235

and she carried in her hand a naked weapon DELONEY-E2-P2,48.236

and shee was called the <font> Sword <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,48.237

The third was also a cruell creature, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.238

her eyes did sparkle like burning coales: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.239

her hayre was like a flame: and her garments like burning brasse:
DELONEY-E2-P2,48.240

shee was so hot that none could stand neere her, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.241

and they called her name <font> Fyre <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,48.242

After this they retyred againe, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.243

and brought vnto his Highnesse two other Personages, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.244

their countenaunce was Princely and amiable, their attyre most rich and
sumptuous: DELONEY-E2-P2,48.245

The one carried in his hand a golden trumpet, and the other a Palmetree
, DELONEY-E2-P2,48.246

and these were called <font> Fame <$$font> and <font> Victory <$$font>,
whom the goddesse of Chastitie charged to waite vpon this famous Prince
for euer.  DELONEY-E2-P2,48.247

This done, each child after other with due reuerence gaue vnto his
Maiestie a sweete smelling Gilliflower, after the manner of the
Persians, offering something in token of loyalty and obedience.
DELONEY-E2-P2,48.248

The King and Queene behoulding <P_49> the sweet fauour and countenance
of these children, demaunded of <font> Iack <$$font> of <font> Newbery
<$$font> whose children they were?  Who answered: It shall please your
Highnesse to vnderstand, that these are the children of poore people:
that do get their liuing by picking of woll, hauing scant a good meale
once in a weeke.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.249

With that the King began to tell his Gilliflowers, whereby hee found
that there was 96. children.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.250

Certainely said the Queene I perceiue God gives as faire children to
the poore as to the rich, and fairer manie times: DELONEY-E2-P2,49.251

and though their dyet and keeping bee but simple, the blessing of God
doth cherish them.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.252

Therefore sayd the Queene I will request to haue two of them to waite
in my Chamber.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.253

Faire <font> Katherine <$$font> said the King, thou and I haue iumpt
in one opinion, thinking these children fitter for the Court than the
Countrey: whereupon he made choyse of a dozen more: DELONEY-E2-P2,49.254

foure he ordained to be Pages to his royall person, DELONEY-E2-P2,49.255

and the rest hee sent to Uniuersities, allotting to euery one a Gentlemans
liuing.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.256

Diuers of the Noble men did in like sort entertaine some of those children
into their seruices, so that <paren> in the end <$$paren> not one was
left to picke wool, but were all so prouided for, that their Parents
neuer needed to care for them: DELONEY-E2-P2,49.257

and God so blessed them, that each of them came to be men of great
account and authority in the land, whose posterities remaine to this
day worshipfull and famous.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.258

The King, Queene, and Nobles being ready to depart, after great thankes
and gifts giuen to <font> Iack <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font>,
his Maiestie would haue made him Knight, DELONEY-E2-P2,49.259

but hee meekely refused it, saying: I beseech your Grace let me liue a
poore Clothier among my people, in whose maintenance I take more felicity
, then in all the vaine titles of Gentilitie: DELONEY-E2-P2,49.260

for these are the labouring Ants whom I seeke to defend,
DELONEY-E2-P2,49.261

and these bee the Bees which I keepe: who labour in this life, not for
our selues, but for the glory of God, and to do seruice to our dread
Soueraigne.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.262

Thy knighthood need be no hinderance of thy faculty, quoth the King.
DELONEY-E2-P2,49.263

O my drad Soueraigne said <font> Iacke <$$font>, honour and worship may
be compared to the Lake of <font> Laethe <$$font>, which makes men forget
themselues that taste thereof: DELONEY-E2-P2,49.264

and to the end I may still keepe in minde from whence I came, and what I
am, I beseech your Grace let mee rest in my russet coat a poore Clothier
to my dying day.  DELONEY-E2-P2,49.265

<P_50>

Seeing then <paren> said the King <$$paren> that a mans minde is
a Kingdome to himselfe, I will leaue thee to the riches of thy owne
content, DELONEY-E2-P2,50.267

and so farewell.  DELONEY-E2-P2,50.268

The Queenes Maiesty taking her leaue of the good wife with a Princely
kisse, gaue her in token of remembrance a most precious and rich Dyamond
set in gold, about the which was also curiously set sixe Rubies, and sixe
Emeralds in one peece, valued at nine hundred Marks: DELONEY-E2-P2,50.269

and so her Grace departed.  DELONEY-E2-P2,50.270

But in this meane space <font> Will Sommers <$$font> kept company among
the maids, DELONEY-E2-P2,50.271

and betooke himselfe to spinning as they did, which among them was held
as a forfeit of a gallon of wine: DELONEY-E2-P2,50.272

but <font> William <$$font> by no meanes would pay it except they
would take it out in kisses, rating euery kisse at a farthing.
DELONEY-E2-P2,50.273

This paiment we refuse for two causes quoth the Maidens:
DELONEY-E2-P2,50.274

the one, for that we esteem not kisses at so base a rate:
DELONEY-E2-P2,50.275

and the other, because in so doing we should giue as much as you.
DELONEY-E2-P2,50.276

CHAPTER IV.  DELONEY-E2-P2,50.278

How the maidens serued <font> Wil Sommers <$$font> for his sawsinesse.
DELONEY-E2-P2,50.279

<$$heading>

The maidens consented together, seeing <font> Will Sommers <$$font>
was so busie both with their worke, and in his wordes, and would not
pay his forfeiture, to serue him as he serued: DELONEY-E2-P2,50.281

first therefore they bound him hand and foote, DELONEY-E2-P2,50.282

and set him vpright against a poste, tying him thereto, which he tooke in
ill part, notwithstanding he could not resist them: DELONEY-E2-P2,50.283

and because hee let his tongue runne at randome, they set a faire gagge
in his mouth, such a one as he could not for his life put away: so that
he stood as one gaping for winde.  DELONEY-E2-P2,50.284

Then one of them got a couple of dogs droppings, DELONEY-E2-P2,50.285

and putting them in a bagge, laide them in soke in a bason of water,
while the rest turned downe the coller of his Ierkin, and put an hoste
cloath about his necke in stead of a fine towell: DELONEY-E2-P2,50.286

then came the <P_51> other maide with a bason and water in the same,
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.287

and with the perfume in the pudding-bagge, flapt him about the face and
lips, till he looked like a tawnie Moore, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.288

and with her hand washt him very orderly: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.289

the smell being somwhat strong, <font> Will <$$font> could by no meanes
abide it, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.290

and for want of other language, cryed <font> Ah ha ha ha <$$font>.
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.291

Faine hee would haue spet, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.292

and could not, so that he was faine to swallow down such liquor as hee
neuer tasted the like.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.293

When hee had a pretty while been washed in this sort, at the length he
croucht downe vpon his knees, yeelding himselfe to their fauor : which the
maidens perceiuing, pulled the gag out of his mouth.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.294

He had no sooner the liberty of his tongue, but that he curst and swore
like a diuel: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.295

the maides that could scant stand for laughing, at last askt how hee
liked his washing?  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.296

Washing, quoth hee?  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.297

I was neuer thus washt, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.298

nor euer met with such Barbers since I was borne: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.299

let mee goe quoth hee, and I will giue you whatsoeuer you will demand:
wherewith hee cast them an English Crowne.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.300

My quoth one of the maides, you are yet but washt, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.301

but wee will shaue you ere yee goe.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.302

Sweete Maides quoth hee pardon my shauing, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.303

let it suffice that you haue washt mee: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.304

if I haue done a trespasse to your trade, forgiue it mee,
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.305

and I will neuer hereafter offend you.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.306

Tush said the Maides you haue made our wheeles cast their bands and
bruzed the teeth of our cards in such sort, as the offence may not bee
remitted without great penance.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.307

As for your gold wee regarde it not: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.308

therefore as you are perfumed fit for the dogges, so we enioine you this
night to serue all our hogs, which penance if you will sweare with all
speede to performe, we will let you loose.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.309

O quoth <font> Will <$$font>, the huge Elephant was neuer more fearefull
of the silly sheepe, than I am of your displeasures: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.310

therefore let mee loose and I will doo it with all diligence.
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.311

Then they vnbound him, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.312

and brought him among a great companie of Swyne, which when <font> Will
<$$font> had well viewed ouer, hee draue out of the yard all the sowes.
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.313

Why how now quoth the maides, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.314

what meane you by this?  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.315

Mary quoth <font> Will <$$font>, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.316

these be all sowes, DELONEY-E2-P2,51.317

and my pennance is but to serue the hogs.  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.318

It is true quoth they: DELONEY-E2-P2,51.319

haue you ouertaken vs in this sort?  DELONEY-E2-P2,51.320

Well looke there bee not one hog vnserued wee would aduise you.
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.321

<font> Will Sommers <$$font> stript vp his sleeues very orderly,
DELONEY-E2-P2,51.322

and clapt an apron <P_52> about his motley hosen, DELONEY-E2-P2,52.323

and taking a paile serued the hogs handsomely.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.324

When he had giuen them all meate, he sayd thus: DELONEY-E2-P2,52.325

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_52>

Nay soft friend quoth they, the veriest hog of all hath yet had nothing.
DELONEY-E2-P2,52.328

Where the diuell is he said <font> Will <$$font> that I see him not?
DELONEY-E2-P2,52.329

Wrapt in a motley Ierkin quoth they, DELONEY-E2-P2,52.330

take thy selfe by the nose, and thou shalt catch him by the snout.
DELONEY-E2-P2,52.331

I was neuer so verie a hog quoth hee, but I would always spare from my
own bellie to giue to a Woman.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.332

If thou do not <paren> say they <$$paren> eate <paren> like the prodigall
Childe <$$paren> with thy fellow hogs, wee will so shaue thee, as thou
shalt dearely repent thy disobedience.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.333

He seeing no remedie, committed himselfe to their mercie:
DELONEY-E2-P2,52.334

and so they let him goe.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.335

When hee came to the Court, hee shewed to the King al his aduenture
among the Weauers maidens, wherat the King and Queene laughed heartily.

CHAPTER V.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.338

Of the pictures which <font> Iacke <$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font>
had in his house, whereby hee encouraged his seruants to seeke for fame
and dignitie.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.339

<$$heading>

In a faire large Parlour which was wainscotted about, <font> Iacke
<$$font> of <font> Newbery <$$font> had 15. faire Pictures hanging,
which were couered with curtaines of green silke, fringed with gold, which
hee would often shew to his friends and seruants.  DELONEY-E2-P2,52.341

In the first was the picture <P_53> of a sheepheard before whom kneeled
a great King named <font> Viriat <$$font>, who sometime gouerned the
people of <font> Portugal <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.342

See heere quoth <font> Iacke <$$font>, the father a Shepheard, the sonne
a Soueraigne.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.343

This man ruled in <font> Portugall <$$font>, DELONEY-E2-P2,53.344

and made great warres against the Romanes, DELONEY-E2-P2,53.345

and after that inuaded <font> Spaine <$$font>, DELONEY-E2-P2,53.346

yet in the end was traiterously slaine.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.347

The next was the Portraiture of <font> Agathocles <$$font>, which
for his surpassing wisedome and manhood, was created King of <font>
Sicilia <$$font>, and maintained battaile against the people of <font>
Carthage <$$font>.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.348

His Father was a poore Potter, before whom he also kneeled.
DELONEY-E2-P2,53.349

And it was the vse of this King, that whensoeuer he made a banquet,
he would haue as well vessels of earth as of golde set vpon the Table,
to the intent hee might alwaies beare in mind the place of his beginning,
his Fathers house and family.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.350

The third was the picture of <font> Iphicrates <$$font> an Athenian
borne, who vanquished the Lacedemonians in plaine and open battaile.
DELONEY-E2-P2,53.351

This man was Captaine generall to <font> Artaxerxes <$$font>, King
of <font> Persia <$$font>, whose father was notwithstanding a Cobler,
and there likewise pictured.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.352

<font> Eumenes <$$font> was also a famous Captaine to <font>
Alexander <$$font> the great, whose father was no other then a Carter.
DELONEY-E2-P2,53.353

The fourth was the similitude of <font> Aelius Pertinax <$$font>,
sometime Emperor of Rome, DELONEY-E2-P2,53.354

yet was his father but a Weauer: DELONEY-E2-P2,53.355

and afterward to giue example to others of lowe condition, to beare
minds of worthy men, he caused the shop to be beautified with marble
curiously cut, wherein his father before him was wont to get his liuing.
DELONEY-E2-P2,53.356

The fift was the picture of <font> Dioclesian <$$font>, that so
much adorned Rome with his magnificall and triumphant victories.
DELONEY-E2-P2,53.357

This was a most famous Emperour, although no other than the sonne of
a Book-binder.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.358

<font> Valentinian <$$font> stood the next, painted most artificially:
who also was crowned Emperor, DELONEY-E2-P2,53.359

and was but the sonne of a poore Ropemaker, as in the same picture
was expressed, where his father was painted by him vsing his trade.
DELONEY-E2-P2,53.360

The seuenth was the Emperor <font> Probus <$$font>, whose father being
a Gardener, was pictured by him houlding a spade.  DELONEY-E2-P2,53.361

<P_54>

The eighth picture was of <font> Marcus Aurelius <$$font>, whom euery
age honoureth, DELONEY-E2-P2,54.363

he was so wise and prudent an Emperour: DELONEY-E2-P2,54.364

yet was he but a cloth-weauers sonne.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.365

The ninth was the portraiture of the valiant Emperour <font> Maximinus
<$$font>, the son of a Black-smith, who was there painted as he was wont
to worke at the Anuill.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.366

In the tenth table was painted the Emperour <font> Galerus <$$font>,
who at the first was but a poore shepheard.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.367

Next to this picture was placed the pictures of two Popes of Rome
, whose wisedome and learning aduanced them to that dignitie.
DELONEY-E2-P2,54.368

The first was the liuely counterfeit of Pope <font> Iohn <$$font> the
twenty two, whose father was a Shoomaker: DELONEY-E2-P2,54.369

he beeing elected Pope, increased their rents and patrimonie greatly.
DELONEY-E2-P2,54.370

The other was the picture of Pope <font> Sextus <$$font> the fourth of
that name, being a poore Mariners sonne.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.371

The thirteenth picture was of <font> Lamusius <$$font>, King of <font>
Lombardie <$$font>, who was no better then the son of a common strumpet,
being painted like a naked childe walking in water, and taking hold of
the point of a Launce, by the which hee hung fast, and saued himselfe.
The reason whereof is this.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.372

After his lewde mother was deliuered of him, shee vnnaturally threw him
into a deepe stinking ditch, wherein was some water.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.373

By hap, King <font> Agilmond <$$font> passed that way,
DELONEY-E2-P2,54.374

and found this childe almost drowned, who mouing him somewhat with
the point of his Launce, the better to perceiue what he was, the child
<paren> though newly borne <$$paren> took hold thereof with one of his
pretty hands, not suffering it to slide or slip away againe: which thing
the king considering, beeing amazed at the strange force of this young
little infant, caused it to bee taken vp, and carefully to be fostered,
DELONEY-E2-P2,54.375

and because the place where hee found it, was called <font> Lama <$$font>
, he named the child <font> Lamusius <$$font>: who after grew to be so
braue a man, and so much honoured of Fortune, that in the end hee was
crowned King of the <font> Lombards <$$font>, who liued there in honour,
and in his succession after him, euen vnto the time of the vnfortunate
King <font> Albouina <$$font>, when all came to ruine, subuersion and
destruction.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.376

In the fourteenth picture, <font> Primislas <$$font> King of <font>
Bohemia <$$font>, was most artificially drawne, before whom there stood
an horse without bridle or saddle, in a field where husbandmen were
at plough.  DELONEY-E2-P2,54.377

<P_55>

The cause why this King was thus painted <paren> quoth <font> Iack
<$$font> <$$paren> was this.  DELONEY-E2-P2,55.379

At that time the King of the <font> Bohemians <$$font> died without
issue, DELONEY-E2-P2,55.380

and great strife being among the Nobility for a new King, at length
they all consented that a horse should be let into the field, without
bridle or saddle, hauing all determined with a most assured purpose
to make him their King, before whom this horse rested: At what time it
came to passe, that the horse first stayed himselfe before this <font>
Primislas <$$font>, being a simple creature, who was then busie driuing
the plough: DELONEY-E2-P2,55.381

they presently made him their Soueraigne, who ordered himselfe and his
Kingdome very wisely.  DELONEY-E2-P2,55.382

Hee ordained many good Lawes, DELONEY-E2-P2,55.383

he compassed the Citty of Prague with strong walles, besides many other
things, meriting perpetuall laud and commendations.  DELONEY-E2-P2,55.384

The fifteenth was the picture of <font> Theophrastus <$$font>, a
Philosopher, a counsellor of Kings, and companion of Nobles, who was
but sonne of a Taylor.  DELONEY-E2-P2,55.385

Seeing then my good seruants, that these men haue been aduanced to high
estate and Princely dignities by wisedome, learning, and diligence,
I would wish you to imitate the like vertues, that you might attaine
the like honors: DELONEY-E2-P2,55.386

for which of you doth know what good fortune God hath in store for you?
DELONEY-E2-P2,55.387

there is none of you so poorly born, but that men of baser birth haue
come to great honors: DELONEY-E2-P2,55.388

the idle hand shall euer goe in a ragged garment, DELONEY-E2-P2,55.389

and the slothfull liue in reproach: DELONEY-E2-P2,55.390

but such as do leade a vertuous life, and gouerne themselues discreetely
, shall of the best bee esteemed, and spend their dayes in credit.
DELONEY-E2-P2,55.391
