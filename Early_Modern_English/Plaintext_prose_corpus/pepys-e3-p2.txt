<P_8,320>

And it is pretty that G Holmes did tell his fellows, and these boys swore
it, that he did set fire to a box of linen in the Sheriffs, $Sir $Joseph
Shelden's, house while he was attending the fire in Aldersgate-street,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.2

and the Sheriffe himself $said that there was a fire in his house,
in a box of linen, at the same time, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.3

but $can $not {TEXT:cannot} conceive how this fellow should do it.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.4

The boys did swear against one of them, that he had made it his
part to pull out the plug out of the engine while it was a-playing;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.5

and it really was so.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.6

And goods they did carry away, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.7

and the manner of the setting the house on fire was that Holmes did get
to a Cockepitt <paren> where it seems there was a public cockpit <$$paren>
and set fire to the straw in it, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.8

and hath a fire-ball at the end of the straw which did take fire,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.9

and so it prevailed PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.10

and burned the house; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.11

and among other things they carried away, he took six of the cocks that
were at the cockpit, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.12

and afterward the boys told us how they had one dressed;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.13

by the same token, it was so hard they could not eat it.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.14

But that which was most remarkable was the impudence of this Holmes,
who hath been arraigned often and got still away; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.15

and on this business was taken, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.16

and broke loose just at Newgate gate PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.17

and was last night luckily taken about Bow; who got loose and run into
the River and hid himself in the Rushes, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.18

and they pursued him with a dog, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.19

and the dog got him PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.20

and held him till he was taken; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,320.21

but the impudence of this fellow was such, that he denied he ever saw
the boys before, or ever knew the Russia-house, or <P_8,321> that the
people knew him; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.22

and by and by the mistress of the Russia-house was called in, being
indicted at the same time about another thing, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.23

and she denied that the fellow was of her acquaintance; when it was
pretty to see how the little boys did presently fall upon her, and ask
her how she durst say so, when she was always with them when they met
at her house, and perticularly when she came in in her smock before
a dozen of them - at which the court laughed and put the woman away.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.24

Well, this fellow Holmes was found guilty of the act of burning the house,
and other things that he stood indicted for; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.25

and then there were other good cases, as of a woman that came to serve a
gentlewoman, and in three days run away, betimes in the morning, with a
great deal of plate and rings and other good things.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.26

It was time very well spent to be here.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.27

Here I saw how favourable the judge $was to a young gentleman that struck
one of the officers for not making him room; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.28

told him he had endangered the loss of his hand, but that he hoped
he had not struck him, and would suppose that he had not struck him.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.29

About $noon the court rose, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.30

and I to dinner with my Lord Mayor and Sheriffs - where a good dinner
and good discourse, the Judge being there.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.31

There was also tried this morning Fielding <paren> which I thought had
been Bazill, but it proved the other, and Bazill was killed <$$paren> that
killed his brother; who was found guilty of murther, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.32

and nobody pitied him.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.33

The Judge seems to be a worthy man and able, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.34

and doth entend of these rogues that burned this house, to be hung in
some conspicuous place in the town, for an example.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.35

After dinner to the court again, where I hear some more causes, but with
so much trouble because of the hot weather, that I had no pleasure in it.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.36

Anon the court rose PEPYS-E3-P2,8,321.37

and I walked to Fleetstreete for my <P_8,322> belt at the Beltmakers;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.38

and so home and to the office, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.39

wrote some letters, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.40

and then home to supper and to bed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.41

5.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.42

Up PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.43

and to the office, where Sir W. Batten, W. Penn , T.
Harvy and I met upon Mr. Gawden's accounts, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.44

and was at it all the morning.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.45

This morning Sir G. Carteret did come to us PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.46

and walked in the garden; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.47

it was to talk with me about something of my Lord Sandwiches;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.48

but here he told us that the great Seale is passed to my Lord Anglesy
for Treasurer of the Navy, so that now he doth no more belong to us -
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.49

and I confess, for his sake I am glad of it - PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.50

and do believe the other will have little content in it.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.51

At noon I home to dinner with my wife; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.52

and after dinner to sing, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.53

and then to the office a little and Sir W. Batten's, where I am
vexed to hear that Nan Wright, now Mrs. Marckham, Sir W.
Penn's maid and whore, is come to sit in our pew at church, and did so
while my Lady Batten was there - PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.54

I confess I am very much vexed at it and ashamed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.55

By and by out with W. Penn to White-hall, where I stayed not;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.56

but to the New Exchange to buy gloves and other little errands,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.57

and so home and to my office, busy till night; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.58

and then walked in the garden with my wife, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.59

and then to supper and to sing, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.60

and so to bed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.61

No news, but that the Dutch are gone clear from Harwich Northward and
have given out they are going to Yarmouth.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.62

6.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.63

Up PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.64

and to the office, where some of us sat busy all the morning.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.65

At noon home to dinner, whither Creed came to dine with us and brings the
first word I hear of the news of a peace, the King having letters come to
him this noon, signifying that it is concluded on and that Mr.
Coventry is upon his way, coming over for the King's ratification.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,322.66

The news was so good and sudden, that I went with great joy to
W. Batten and then to <P_8,323> W. Penn to tell it them;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.67

and so home to dinner, mighty merry and light at my heart only on this
ground, that a continuing of the war must undo us, and so, though peace
may do the like, if we do not make good use of it to reform ourselfs
and get up money, yet there is an opportunity for us to save ourselfs -
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.68

at least, for my own perticular, we shall continue well till I can get
my money into my hands, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.69

and then I will shift for myself.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.70

After dinner away, leaving Creed there, by coach to Westminster, where
to the Swan and drank; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.71

and then to the Hall PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.72

and there talked a little, with great joy of the peace;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.73

and then to Mrs. Martins, where I met with the good news que
esta no es con child $she $having $de $estos $upon $her - the fear
of which, which she did give me the other day, had troubled me much.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.74

My joy in this made me send for wine, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.75

and thither came her sister PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.76

and Mrs. Cragg and I stayed a good while there.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.77

But here happened the best instance of a woman's falseness in the world ;
that her sister Doll, who went for a bottle of wine, did come home all
blubbering and swearing against one Captain Vandena, a Dutchman of the
Rhenish wine-house, that pulled her into a stable by the Dog tavern
and there did tumble her and toss her; calling him all the rogues and
toads in the world, when she knows that ella hath suffered me $to $do
$anything $with $her a hundred times.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.78

Thence with joyful heart to White-hall to ask Mr. Williamson
the news; who told me that Mr. Coventry is coming over with a
project of a peace; which, if the States agree to and our King, when
their ministers on both sides have showed it them, we shall agree ,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.79

and that is all; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.80

but the King I hear doth give it out plain that the peace is concluded.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.81

Thence by coach home PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.82

and there wrote a few letters; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.83

and then to consult with my wife about going to Epsum tomorrow, sometimes
designing to go and then again not; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.84

and at last it grew late PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.85

and I bethought myself of business to imploy me at home tomorrow,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.86

and so I did not go.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.87

This afternoon I met with Mr. Rolt, who tells me that he is
going Cornett under Collonell Ingoldsby, being his old acquaintance,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.88

and Ingoldsby hath a troop now from under the King; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,323.89

and I <P_8,324> think it is a handsome way for him.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.90

But it was an ominous thing $me $thought {TEXT:methought}, just as he
was bidding me his last Adieu, his nose fell a-bleeding, which run in
my mind a pretty while after.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.91

This afternoon Sir Alex. Frazier, who was of counsel for
Sir Jo. Minnes and had given him over for a dead man, said
to me at White-hall:"What,"says he,"Sir Jo. Minnes is dead.
"PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.92

I told him no, but that there is hopes of his life.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.93

$Me $thought {TEXT:Methought} he looked very sillily after it,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.94

and went his way.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.95

Late home to supper, a little troubled at my not going to Epsum tomorrow
as I had resolved, especially having the Duke of York and W.
Coventry out of town; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.96

but it was my own fault, and at last my judgment to stay;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.97

and so after supper, to bed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.98

<paren> This day, with great satisfaction I hear that my Lady Jemimah is
brought to bed at Hinchingbrooke of a boy.  <$$paren> PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.99

7.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.100

<font>

Lords day.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.102

<$$font>

Up; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.104

and to my chamber, there to settle some papers; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.105

and thither comes Mr. Moore to me PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.106

and talked till church-time of the news of the times about the peace,
and the bad consequences of it if it be not improved to good purpose of
fitting ourselfs for another war.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.107

He tells me he hears that the discontented Parliament-men are fearful
that the next sitting the King will put for a general Excize, by which
to raise him money, and then to fling off the Parliament, and raise a
land-army and keep them all down like slaves; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.108

and it is gotten among them that Bab. May, the Privy-purse, hath
been heard to say that 300 <font> l <$$font> a year is enough for any
country gentleman; which makes them mad, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.109

and they do talk of 6 or 800000 gone into the privy-purse this war, when
in King James's time it arose but to 5000 <font> l <$$font> and in King
Charles's but 10000 <font> l <$$font> in a year.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,324.110

He tells me that a goldsmith in town told him, that being with some
plate with my Lady Castlemaine lately, she directed her woman <paren>
the great <P_8,325> beauty <$$paren>,"Willson,"says she,"make a note
for this and for that to the Privy-purse for money. "PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.111

He tells me a little more of the basenesse of the courses taken at Court
in the case of Mr. Moyer, who is at liberty and is to give 500
<font> l <$$font> for his liberty; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.112

but now the great ones are $divided who shall have the money,
the Duke of Albemarle on one hand, and another Lord on the other;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.113

and that it is fain to be decided by having the person's name put into
the King's warrant for his liberty, at whose intercession the King
shall own that he is set at liberty; which is a most lamentable thing,
that we do professedly own that we do these things, not for right and
justice sake, but only to gratify this or that person about the $King.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.114

God forgive us all.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.115

Busy till noon PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.116

and then home to dinner PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.117

and Mr. Moore come PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.118

and dined with us, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.119

and much more discourse at and after dinner of the same kind;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.120

and then he gone, I to my office, busy till the evening;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.121

and then with my wife and Jane over to Half-way house,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.122

a very good walk, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.123

and there drank; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.124

and in the cool of the evening back again, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.125

and sang with pleasure upon the water PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.126

and were mightily pleased in hearing a boat full of spaniards sing;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.127

and so home to supper and to bed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.128

Jane of late mighty fine, by reason of a laced whiske her
mistress hath given her, which makes her a very gracefull servant.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.129

But above all, my wife and I were the most surprized in the beauty of a
plain girle which we met in the little lane going from Redriffe-stairs
into the fields, one of the prettiest faces that we think we ever saw
in our lives.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.130

8.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.131

Up PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.132

and to my chamber; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.133

and by and by comes Greeting, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.134

and to my flagelette with him with a pretty deal of pleasure;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.135

and then to the office, where W. Batten, W. Penn and I met
about putting men to work for the weighing of the ships in the River sunk.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.136

Then home again PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.137

and there heard Mr. Caesar play some very good things on the
lute, together with myself on the viall and Greeting on the viallin.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,325.138

Then with my wife abroad by <P_8,326> coach, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.139

she to her tailor's, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.140

I to Westminster to Burges about my Tanger business; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.141

and thence to White-hall, where I spoke with Sir John Nicholas, who
tells me that Mr. Coventry is come from Bredah as was expected
; but contrary to expectation, brings with him two or three Articles
which do not please the King - as, to retrench the Act of Navigation ,
and then to ascertaine what are contraband goods.  And then, that those
exiled persons who are or shall take refuge in their country may be
secure from any further prosecution.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.142

Whether these will be enough to break the peace upon or no, he $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} tell; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.143

but I perceive the certainty of peace is blown over.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.144

So called on my wife PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.145

and met Creed by the way, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.146

and they two and I to Charing-cross, there to see the great Boy and Girle
that are lately come out of Ireland; the latter, eight {COM:years_old}
, the former but four years old, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.147

of most prodigious bigness for their age.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.148

I tried to weigh them in my arms, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.149

and find them twice as heavy as people almost twice their age;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.150

and yet I am apt to believe they are very young - their father a little
sorry fellow, and their mother an old Irish woman.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.151

They have had four children of this bigness and four of ordinary growth,
whereof two of each are dead.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.152

If <paren> as my Lord Ormond certifies <$$paren> it be true that they
are no older, it is very monstrous.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.153

So home and to dinner with my wife, and to pipe.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.154

And then I to the office, where busy all the afternoon till the evening
; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.155

and then with my wife by coach abroad to Bow and Stratford, it being so
dusty weather, that there was little pleasure in it; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.156

and so home and to walk in the garden, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.157

and thither comes Pelling to us to talk; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.158

and so in PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.159

and to supper, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.160

and then to bed - all the world being, as I hear, very much damped that
their hopes of peace is become uncertain again.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,326.161

<P_8,327>

9.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.163

Up pretty betimes PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.164

and to the office, where busy till office time; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.165

and then we sat, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.166

but nothing to do but receive clamours about money.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.167

This day my Lord Anglesy, our new Treasurer, came the first time to the
Board, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.168

and there sat with us till noon; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.169

and I do perceive he is a very notable man and understanding, and will
do things regular and understand them himself, not trust Fenn as Sir
G. Carteret did, and will solicit soundly for money; which I do
fear was Sir G. Carteret's fault, that he did not do that enough,
considering the age we live in, that nothing will do but by solicitation -
though never so good for the King or Kingdom; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.170

and a bad business well solicited shall for peace sake speed, when a
good one shall not.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.171

But I do confess I do think it a very bold act of him to take upon him
the place of Treasurer of the Navy at this time; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.172

but when I consider that a regular accountant never ought to fear anything
, nor have reason, I then do cease to wonder.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.173

At noon home to dinner and to play on the flagelette with my wife;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.174

and then to the office, where very busy, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.175

close at my office till late at night; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.176

at night walked and sang with my wife in the garden, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.177

and so home to supper and to bed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.178

This evening news comes for certain that the Dutch are with their fleet
before Dover, and that it is expected they will attempt something there.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.179

The business of the peace is quite dashed again, so as now it is doubtful
whether the King will condescend to what the Dutch demand, it being so
near the Parliament, it being a thing that will, it may be, recommend
him to them when they shall find that the not having of a peace lies on
his side, by denying some of their demands.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.180

This morning Captain Clerke <paren> Robin Clerke <$$paren> was at the
table, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.181

now commands the <font> Monmouth <$$font> PEPYS-E3-P2,8,327.182

and did when the enemy passed the Chain at Chatham the other day, who
said publicly at the table that he did admire at the order when it was
brought him, for sinking of the <font> Monmouth <$$font> <paren> to the
endangering of the ship and spoiling of all her provisions <$$paren>
when her number of men were upon her, that he could have carried her up
the River whither he <P_8,328> pleased and have been a guard to the rest,
and could have sunk her at any time.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.183

He did carry some 100 barrels of powder out of the ship, to save it,
after the order came for the sinking her.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.184

He knew no reason at all, he declares, that could lead them to order
the sinking her, nor the rest of the great ships that were sunk;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.185

but above all, admires they would burn them on shore and sink them there ,
when it had been better to have sunk them long way in the middle of the
River, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.186

for then they could not have burned them so low as now they did.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.187

10.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.188

Up, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.189

and to the office betimes; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.190

and there all the morning very busy, causing papers to be entered
and sorted, to put the office in order against the Parliament.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.191

At noon home to dinner PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.192

and then to the office again, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.193

close all the afternoon, $upon the same occasion, with great pleasure
till late; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.194

and then with my wife and Mercer in the garden PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.195

and sung; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.196

and then home PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.197

and sung, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.198

and to supper with great content, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.199

and so to bed.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.200

The Duke of York is come back last night from Harwich,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.201

but $what news he brings I know not - nor hear anything today from
Dover whether the enemy have made any attempt there, as was expected.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.202

This day our girle Mary, whom Payne helped us to, to be under his daughter
when that she came to be our cookmaid, did go away, declaring that she
must be where she might earn something one day, and spend it and play
away the next - PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.203

but a good civil wench, and one neither wife {COM:sic} nor I did ever
give angry word to; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.204

but she hath this silly vanity that she must play.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.205

11.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.206

Up betimes PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.207

and to my office, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.208

and there busy till the office <paren> which was only Sir T.
Harvy and myself <$$paren> met; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.209

and did little business PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.210

and then broke up.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.211

He tells me that the Council last night did sit close, to determine of
the King's answer about the peace; and that though he doth not certainly
know, yet by all discourse yesterday, he doth believe it is peace;
and that the King had said it should be peace and had bidden Alderman
Backewell to declare upon the Change.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.212

It is high time for us to have peace, that the King and Council may get
up their credits and have time to do it, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,328.213

for that endeed {COM:sic} is the bottom of all our <P_8,329> misery, that
nobody hath any so good opinion of the King and his Council and their
advice, as to lend money, or venture their persons or estates or pains
upon people that they know $can $not {TEXT:cannot} thrive with all that
we can do, but either by their corruption or negligence must be undone.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.214

This endeed {COM:sic} is the very bottom of every man's thought, and the
certain ground that we must be ruined, unless the King change his course,
or the Parliament come and alter it.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.215

At noon dined alone with my wife.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.216

All the afternoon close at the office, very hard at gathering papers
and putting things in order against the Parliament; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.217

and at night home with my wife to supper, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.218

and then to bed, in hopes to have all things in my office in good
condition in a little time for anybody to examine, which I am sure none
else will.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.219

12.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.220

Up betimes PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.221

and to my chamber, there doing business; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.222

and by and by comes Greeting, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.223

and begun a new month with him, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.224

and now to learn to set anything from the notes upon the flagelette;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.225

but Lord, to see how like a fool he goes about to give me direction
would make a man mad.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.226

I out, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.227

and by coach to White-hall and to the Treasury-chamber, where did a
little business; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.228

and thence to the Exchequer to Burges about Tanger business;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.229

and so back again, stepping into the Hall a little, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.230

and then homeward by coach PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.231

and met at White-hall with Sir H. Cholmly; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.232

and so into his coach, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.233

and he with me to the Excise Office, there to do a little business also
- in the way, he telling me that undoubtedly the peace is concluded,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.234

for he did stand yesterday where he did hear part of the discourse at
the Council-table, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.235

and there did hear the King argue for it; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.236

among other things, that the spirits of the seamen were down, and the
forces of our enemies are grown too great and many for us, and he would
not have his subjects overpressed, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,329.237

for he knew an Englishman would do as much as any man upon hopeful terms,
<P_8,330> but where he sees he is overpressed, he despairs as soon as
any other; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.238

and besides that, they have already such a load of dejection already
upon them, that they will not be in temper a good while again.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.239

He heard my Lord Chancellor say to the King,"Sir,"says he, "the whole
world doth complain publicly of treachery, that things have been managed
falsely by some of his {COM:sic} great ministers; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.240

Sir,"says he,"I am for your Majesty's falling into a speedy enquiry into
the truth of it, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.241

and where you meet with it, punish it - PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.242

but at the same time, consider what you have to do, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.243

and make use of your time for having a peace; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.244

for more money will not be given without much trouble,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.245

nor is it I fear to be had of the people, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.246

nor will a little do it, to put us into condition of doing our business.
"PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.247

But the other day Sir H. Cholmly tells me, he did say the other
day at his table -"Treachery? "says he, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.248

"I could wish we could prove there was anything of that in it,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.249

for that would imply some wit and thoughtfulness; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.250

but we are ruined merely by folly and neglect. "PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.251

And so Sir H. Cholmly tells me they did all argue for peace,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.252

and so he doth believe that the King hath agreed to the three points
Mr. Coventry brought over, which I have mentioned before, and is
gone with them back.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.253

He tells me further, that the Duke of Buckingham was before the Council
the other day, and there did carry it very submissively and pleasingly
to the King; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.254

but to my Lord Arlington, who doth prosecute the business, he was most
bitter and sharp, and very slighting.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.255

As to the letter about his imploying a man to cast the King's
nativity , says he to the King,"Sir,"says he, this is none of my hand,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.256

and I refer it to your Majesty whether you do not know this hand.
"PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.257

The King answered that it was endeed none of his, and that he knew whose
it was, but could not recall it presently - PEPYS-E3-P2,8,330.258

"Why,"says he,"it is my sister of Richmonds, some frolic or other of
hers of some <P_8,331> certain person; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.259

and there is nothing of the King's name in it, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.260

but it is only said to be his by supposition, as is said. "
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.261

The King, it seems, seemed not very displeased with what the Duke had
said; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.262

but however, he is still in the Tower, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.263

and no discourse of his being out in haste - though my Lady Castlemayne
hath so far solicited for him, that the King and she are quite fallen
out; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.264

he comes not to her PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.265

nor hath for some three or four days, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.266

and parted with very foul words, the King calling her a whore, and a
jade that meddled with things she had nothing to do withal.  And she
calling him fool; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.267

and told him, if he was not a fool, he would not suffer his businesses
to be carried by fellows that did not understand them, and cause his
best subjects, and those best able to serve him, to be imprisoned,
meaning the Duke of Buckingham; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.268

and it seems she was not only for his liberty, but to be restored to all
his places; which it is thought he will never be.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.269

While we were at the Excise office talking with Mr. Ball, it was
computed that the Parliament had given the King, for this war only,
besides all prizes and besides the 200000 <font> l <$$font> which he
was to spend of his own revenue to guard the sea, above five millions
and odd 100000 l's {COM:l_in_italics}; which is a most prodigious sum.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,331.270

Sir H. Cholmly, as a true English gentleman, doth decry the
King's expenses of his privy-purse; which in King James's time did not
rise to above 5000 <font> l <$$font> a year and in King Charles's to
10000 <font> l <$$font>, do now cost us above 100000 <font> l <$$font>
- besides the great charge of the Monarchy; as, the Duke of York 100000
<font> l <$$font> of it, and other limbs of the Royall <P_8,332> family ,
and the guards, which for his part, says he,"I would have all disbanded;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.271

for the King is not the better by them PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.272

and would be as safe without them, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.273

for we have had no rebellions to make him fear anything. "
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.274

But contrarily, he is now raising of a land-army, which this Parliament
and Kingdom will never bear; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.275

besides, the commanders they put over them are such as will never be
able to raise or command them.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.276

But the design is, and the Duke of York he says is hot for it, to
have a land army, and so to make the government like that of France;
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.277

but our princes have not brains, or at least care and forecast enough,
to do that.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.278

It is strange how he and everybody doth nowadays reflect upon Oliver and
commend him, so brave things he did and made all the neighbour princes
fear him; while here a prince, come in with all the love and prayers
and good liking of his people, and have given greater signs of loyallty
and willingness to serve him with their estates then ever was done by
any people, hath lost all so soon, that it is a miracle what way a man
could devise to lose so much in so little time.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,332.279

Thence he set me down at my Lord <P_8,333> Crew's PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.280

and away, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.281

and I up to my Lord, where Sir Tho. Crew was; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.282

and by and by comes Mr. Caesar, who teaches my Lady's page upon
the Lute, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.283

and here Mr. Caesar did play some very fine things endeed, to my
great liking.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.284

Here was my Lord Hinchingbrooke also, newly come from Hinchingbrooke,
where all well; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.285

but $me $thinks {TEXT:methinks}, I knowing in what case he stands for
money, by his demands to me and the report Mr. Moore gives of
the management of the family, makes me, God forgive me, to contemn him,
though I do really honour and pity them; though they deserve it not, that
have so good an estate and will live beyond it.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.286

To dinner, and very good discourse with my Lord; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.287

and after dinner, Sir Tho. Crew and I alone, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.288

and he tells me how I am mightily in esteem with the Parliament, there
being harangues made in the House to the Speaker of Mr. Pepys's
readiness and civility to show them everything; which I am at this time
very glad of.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.289

He tells me the news of the King and my Lady Castlemaine which I have
wrote already this day - and the design of the Parliament to look into
things very well before they give any more money, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.290

and I pray God they may.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.291

Thence after dinner to St. James's, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.292

but missed Sir W. Coventry; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.293

and so home PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.294

and there find my wife in a dogged humour for my not dining at home,
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.295

and I did give her a pull by the nose and some ill words, which she
provoked me to by something she spoke, that we fell extraordinarily out;
insomuch, that I going to the office to avoid further anger, she fallowed
me in a devilish manner thither, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.296

and with much ado I got her into the garden out of hearing, to prevent
shame; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.297

and so home, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.298

and by degrees I found it necessary to calme her, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.299

and did; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.300

and then to the office, where pretty late, and then to walk with her in
the garden, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.301

and so to supper PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.302

and pretty good friends; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.303

and so to bed - with my mind very quiet.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.304

13.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.305

Up pretty betimes, it being mighty hot weather and I lying this night
<paren> which I have not done I believe since a boy; I am sure not since
before I had the stone before <$$paren> with only a rugg and a sheet
upon me.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.306

To my chamber, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.307

and my wife up to do something PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.308

and by chance we fell out again; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,333.309

but I to the <P_8,334> office, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.310

and there we did at the board much business, though the most was the
dividing of 5000 <font> l <$$font> <paren> which the Lords-Comissioners
have with great difficulty found upon our letter to them this week that
would have required 50000 <font> l <$$font> <$$paren> among a great
many occasions.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.311

After rising, my Lord Anglesy, this being the second time of his being
with us, did take me aside PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.312

and asked me where I lived, because he would be glad to have some
discourse with me.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.313

This I liked well enough, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.314

and told him I would wait upon him, which I will do; PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.315

and so all broke up, PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.316

and I home to dinner, where Mr. Pierce dined with us; who tells
us what troubles me, that my Lord Buckhurst hath got Nell away from
the King's House, lies with her, and gives her 100 <font> l <$$font>
a year, so as she hath sent her parts to the House and will act no more.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.317

And yesterday Sir Tho. Crew told me that Lacy lies a-dying of
the pox, and yet hath his whore by him; whom he will have to look on
, he says, though he can do no more; nor would receive any ghostly
advice from a Bishop, an old acquaintance of his that went to see him.
PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.318

He says there is a strangeness between the King and my Lady Castlemayne,
as I was told yesterday.  PEPYS-E3-P2,8,334.319
