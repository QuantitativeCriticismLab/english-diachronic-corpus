<P_64>

58.  LOCKE-E3-P2,64.2

I would therefore have nothing but vice absolutely forbidden,
LOCKE-E3-P2,64.3

and since there are very few vices that a child of your sons age is
capeable of, I thinke there will not need many precepts to be given him.
LOCKE-E3-P2,64.4

Lying and stubbornesse and some ill naturd tricks are all the vices I
thinke children of that age can be guilty of, LOCKE-E3-P2,64.5

but these are <P_65> not {COM:sic} neither to be forbid till he
appeares guilty of them, for feare least by forbiding you teach them,
LOCKE-E3-P2,65.6

for when he is first found in a lie or an ill naturd trick, the first
remedy should be to talke to him of it as of a strange monstrous thing
that it could not be supposd he would have donne, a thing to be wonderd
at, and soe shame him out of it.  LOCKE-E3-P2,65.7

59.  LOCKE-E3-P2,65.8

Manners, as they call it, about which children are soe often perplexd
and have soe many wise exortations made them by their wise maids and
governesses, I thinke are rather to be learned by example then rule.
LOCKE-E3-P2,65.9

And children if keept {COM:sic} out of ill company will take a pride
to behave themselves prettily after the fashon of others, perceiving
themselves esteemd and commended for it.  LOCKE-E3-P2,65.10

But if by a litle negligence in this part my young master should not
put off his hat or make legs a la mode, a danceing master would cure
that defect and wipe of all that plainesse of nature which the a la mode
people call rusticity.  LOCKE-E3-P2,65.11

And since nothing appeares to me to give children soe much becomeing
confidence and a behaviour that soe much fits them for the conversation
of those above their age as danceing, I thinke they should be taught to
dance as soon as they are capeable of learning it, LOCKE-E3-P2,65.12

for though this consist only in outward decency of motion, yet I know
not how it gives children manly thoughts and cariage more then anything.
LOCKE-E3-P2,65.13

But otherwise I would not have children much tormented about the
punctilios or nicetys of breeding.  LOCKE-E3-P2,65.14

Any carelessnesse is to be borne with in them that carys not with it
the marks of ill nature, LOCKE-E3-P2,65.15

but that when it appeares in any action is to be corrected by the ways
above mentioned, LOCKE-E3-P2,65.16

and what else remains like clownishnesse or want of perfect good manners
time and observation as they grow up will of its self cure if they are
bread in <P_66> good company, LOCKE-E3-P2,66.17

but if in ill all the rules in the world, all the correction imaginable
will not be able to polish them.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.18

For you must take this for a certain truth that let them have what
instructions you will, what teachers soever you please, that which will
most influence their actions will be the company they converse with.
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.19

Children <paren> nay and men too <$$paren> doe most by example,
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.20

we are all a sort of camelions that still take a tincture from things
about us, LOCKE-E3-P2,66.21

nor is it to be wonderd at in children who better understand what they
see then what they heare.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.22

60.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.23

I mentioned above one great mischeife that came by servants to children
, when by their flattery they take of the edg and force of the parents
rebukes, and soe lessen their authority.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.24

And here is another as great or greater inconvenience which children
receive from the ill examples they meet with amongst the meaner servants.
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.25

They are wholy if possible to be kept from such conversation.
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.26

For the contagion of these ill examples both in civility and vertue
horribly infects children as often as they come in reach of it.
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.27

They often learne from ill bread or debauchd servants such language,
ill tricks, and vices as otherwise they would possibly be ignorant of
all their lives.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.28

$'T $is {TEXT:Tis} a hard matter wholy to prevent this mischeife,
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.29

you will have very good luck if you never have an ill bread or vitious
servant, and if from them your children never get any infection.
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.30

But yet as much must be donne towards it as can be, and the children
kept as much as may be in the company of their parents and those to
whose care they are committed.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.31

To this purpose their being there should be made easy to them,
LOCKE-E3-P2,66.32

they should be allowd the libertys and freedomes suitable to their ages
and not be held under unnecessary restraints when in their parents sights
or in their governors.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.33

If it be a prison to them, $'t $is {TEXT:tis} noe wonder they should
not like it.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.34

They must not be hindred from being children and from playing and doeing
as children, but from doeing ill.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.35

All other liberty is to be allowd them.  LOCKE-E3-P2,66.36

<P_67>

Next, to make them in love with the company of their parents, they
should receive all their good things there and from their hands.
LOCKE-E3-P2,67.38

The servants should be hindred from makeing court to them by giveing
them strong drinke, wine, fruit, playthings, and other such matters,
which may make them in love with their Company.  LOCKE-E3-P2,67.39

61.  LOCKE-E3-P2,67.40

Haveing named Company I am almost ready to throw away my pen and trouble
you noe farther on this subject.  LOCKE-E3-P2,67.41

For since that does more then all precepts, rules, instructions, $me
$thinkes {TEXT:methinkes} $'t $is {TEXT:tis} almost wholy in vain to
make a long discourse of other things and to talke of that almost to
noe purpose, LOCKE-E3-P2,67.42

for you will be ready to say, what shall I doe with my son?
LOCKE-E3-P2,67.43

If I keepe him always at home, he will be in danger to be my young Master,
LOCKE-E3-P2,67.44

and if I send him abroad, how is it possible to keepe him from the
contagion of rudnesse and vice which is soe every where in fashon.
LOCKE-E3-P2,67.45

In my house he will perhaps be more innocent, but more ignorant too of
the world, LOCKE-E3-P2,67.46

and being used constantly to the same faces and litle company will when
he comes abroad be a sleepish or conceited creature.  LOCKE-E3-P2,67.47

I confesse both sides has its inconvenience, LOCKE-E3-P2,67.48

but whilst he is at home use him as much to your company and the company
of men, $gentlemen and well bread people that come to your house, as you
can, and keep him from the corruption of your servants and meaner people,
and about his goeing abroad or staying at home we have yet time enough
to consider.  LOCKE-E3-P2,67.49

62.  LOCKE-E3-P2,67.50

Haveing here under consideration how great the influence of company is,
and how prone we are all, espetially children, to <P_68> imitation,
I must take the liberty to set down one thing <paren> though I doubt
not but you need not be advised of it, LOCKE-E3-P2,68.51

but if that were a reason for me $to passe it in silence I might very
well be excused from writeing at all <$$paren>.  LOCKE-E3-P2,68.52

That which I was goeing to say is this that if you will have your son
have a respect for you and your orders you must have a great reverence
for him.  LOCKE-E3-P2,68.53

<font> Maxima debetur pueris reverentia.  <$$font> LOCKE-E3-P2,68.54

You must doe noething before him which you would not have him imitate.
LOCKE-E3-P2,68.55

If any thing scape you which you would have passe for a fault in him,
he will be sure to shelter himself under your example, LOCKE-E3-P2,68.56

and how then you will be able to come at him to correct it in the right
way I doe not easily see, LOCKE-E3-P2,68.57

and if you will punish him for it he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} look on it
as a thing which reason condemns since you practise it, LOCKE-E3-P2,68.58

but he will be apt to interpret it the peevishnesse and arbitrary
imperiousnesse of a father which without any ground for it would deny
his son the liberty and pleasures he takes himself, LOCKE-E3-P2,68.59

or if you would have it thought it is a liberty you take belonging to
a man and not a child, you add but a new temptation, since you must
always remember that children affect to be men earlier then is thought,
LOCKE-E3-P2,68.60

and they love breetches not for their cut or ease but because it is a
marke of a step towards manhood.  LOCKE-E3-P2,68.61

I know he will run litle risque from you your self, LOCKE-E3-P2,68.62

and therefore I adde that what I say of your cariage before your children
must extend itself to all those who have any authority over them, or
for whom you would have them have any respect.  LOCKE-E3-P2,68.63

And this leads me to another consideration, which is the haveing somebody
about them whose only businesse should be to forme their tender years
and manners.  LOCKE-E3-P2,68.64

<P_69>

63.  LOCKE-E3-P2,69.66

In all the whole businesse of Education there is nothing to be lesse
hearkened to nor harder to be well observed then what I am now goeing
to say, LOCKE-E3-P2,69.67

and that is that I would from their first begining to talke have
some describd sober wise person whose care it should be to fashon
them right and keep them from ill, espetially the ill of bad company.
LOCKE-E3-P2,69.68

I thinke this province requires great sobriety, temper, tendernesse,
diligence and discretion, qualitys hardly to be found united in persons
that are to be had for ordinary wages, or easily to be found any where.
LOCKE-E3-P2,69.69

As to the charge of it, I thinke it will be the money best laid out that
can be about our children, LOCKE-E3-P2,69.70

and therefor though it may be expensive more then is ordinary, yet it
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be thought deare.  LOCKE-E3-P2,69.71

He that purchases his child a good minde, well principled, temperd to
virtue and usefullnesse and adorned with civility and good breeding makes
a better purchase for him then if he laid out the money for an addition
of more earth to his former acres.  LOCKE-E3-P2,69.72

Spare it in toyes and playgames, in silke and ribbons, laces and other
uselesse expences as much as you please, LOCKE-E3-P2,69.73

but be not sparing in soe necessary a part as this.  LOCKE-E3-P2,69.74

$'T $is {TEXT:Tis} not good husbandry to make his fortune rich and his
minde poore.  LOCKE-E3-P2,69.75

I have often with great admiration seen people lavish it profusely in
trikeing up their children in fine clothes, lodging and feeding them
sumptuously, allowing them more then enough of uselesse servants, and
yet at the same time starve their mindes and take noe care to cover that
which is the most shamefull nakednesse, viz. their natural wrong
inclinations and ignorance.  LOCKE-E3-P2,69.76

This I can looke on as noe other then a sacrificing to their own vanity,
it shewing more their pride then true care of the good of their children.
LOCKE-E3-P2,69.77

Whatsoever you imploy to the advantage of your sons minde will shew
your true kindenesse, though it be to the lessening of his estate.
LOCKE-E3-P2,69.78

A wise and good man can hardly want either the opinion or reality of
being great or happy, LOCKE-E3-P2,69.79

but he that is <P_70> foolish or vitious can be neither great nor happy,
what estate soever you leave him, LOCKE-E3-P2,70.80

and I aske you whether there be not men in the world whom you had rather
have your son be with 500=li= p. an. then some other you
know with 5000=li=?  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.81

64.  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.82

I conclude then that the consideration of charge will not deterre you
from thoughts like mine.  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.83

The great difficulty will be where to finde a person fit,
LOCKE-E3-P2,70.84

for people of small age, parts or vertue are unfit for this imployment ,
LOCKE-E3-P2,70.85

and those that have greater will hardly be got to undertake such a charge.
LOCKE-E3-P2,70.86

You must therefore looke out early and enquire every where,
LOCKE-E3-P2,70.87

for the world has people of all sorts, LOCKE-E3-P2,70.88

and I remember Montagne says in one of his Essays that the learned
Castalio was fain to make trenchers at Geneva to keepe himself from
starving when his father would have given any money for such a tutor
for his son, and Castalio have willingly imbraced such an imployment
upon very reasonable termes, LOCKE-E3-P2,70.89

but this was for want of intelligence.  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.90

65.  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.91

This is what I have thought concerning the generall method of Educating
your son, which though I am apt to thinke may have some influence on the
whole course of his Education, yet I am far from imagining it conteins all
those particulars which his growing years or peculiar temper may require.
LOCKE-E3-P2,70.92

Nay, haveing writ these general $parts in the warmth of my running
thoughts, there may I suppose be many things I have overseen which if
hereafter they shall offer them selves to my thoughts in any of the
returns of my minde to its usuall and most acceptable imployment of
thinking on you and yours, I shall take the liberty to mention them
to you.  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.93

66.  LOCKE-E3-P2,70.94

In the meane time, haveing premised this in generall, we will now
descend to a more particular consideration of your sons Education.
LOCKE-E3-P2,70.95

That which every $gentleman desires <paren> that takes any care of his
<P_71> Education <$$paren> for his son besides the estate he leaves him
are I suppose these 4 things, Virtue, Wisdome, Breeding, and Learning.
LOCKE-E3-P2,71.96

I will not trouble myself whether these words doe not some of them stand
for the same thing or really include one another.  LOCKE-E3-P2,71.97

I leave to men skild in words the glory of criticiseing.
LOCKE-E3-P2,71.98

It suffices me if I make myself understood, LOCKE-E3-P2,71.99

and I hope you will finde noe difficulty to comprehend my meaning.
LOCKE-E3-P2,71.100

67.  LOCKE-E3-P2,71.101

I place virtue as the first and most necessary of those endowments
that belong to a man or a $gentleman as absolutely necessary to make
him valued and beloved by others, acceptable and tolerable to himself.
LOCKE-E3-P2,71.102

Without that I thinke he will neither be happy in this or the other world.
LOCKE-E3-P2,71.103

As the foundation of this there ought very early to be imprinted on his
minde a true notion of God as of the supreame being, from whom we receive
all our good, that loves us and gives us all things, LOCKE-E3-P2,71.104

and soe worke him into a love and reverence of him.  LOCKE-E3-P2,71.105

This is enough to begin with, without goeing to explain this matter any
farther, for feare least by talkeing too early to him of spirits and
being unseasonably forward to make him understand the incomprehensible
nature of that infinite being, his head be either fild with false or
perplexd with unintelligible notions of him.  LOCKE-E3-P2,71.106

Let him only be told upon occasion of a God that governs all things,
hears and sees every thing, and does all manner of good to those that love
and obey him.  You will finde being told of such a God other thoughts
will be apt to rise up fast enough in his minde about him, which as you
observe them to have any mistakes you must set right, LOCKE-E3-P2,71.107

and I thinke it would be better if men generally rested in such an Idea
of God without being too curious in their notions about a being which we
all acknowledge incomprehensible, whereby many who have not strength and
cleareness of thought to destinguish between what they can and what they
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} know run them selves into <P_72> superstition
or Atheisme, makeing God like themselves, or because they $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} comprehend any thing else, none at all.  LOCKE-E3-P2,72.108

68.  LOCKE-E3-P2,72.109

Haveing by gentle degrees, as you finde them capeable of it, setled such
an Idea of God in his minde and taught him to pray to him, trouble not
his younger years with any discourse of spirits, LOCKE-E3-P2,72.110

and be sure hinder as much as you can any others from doeing so,
LOCKE-E3-P2,72.111

for it commonly tends to fill their mindes with fearfull and distracting
apprehensions, it being the usuall method of servants to make children
obedient to their commands to tell them of spirits and Goblins, whereby
though sometimes they keepe them from commiteing some litle faults,
yet the remedy is much worse then the disease, LOCKE-E3-P2,72.112

and they leave upon their mindes Ideas that follow them with terror
and affrightment, make them dastards and affraid of their shadows and
darkenesse all their lives after, LOCKE-E3-P2,72.113

for it is to be taken notice that the first impressions sinke deepest
into the mindes of children, LOCKE-E3-P2,72.114

and the notions they are possessd with when young are scarce by any
industry or art ever quite whiped out after.  LOCKE-E3-P2,72.115

And I have had those complaine to me when men who had been thus used
when young, that though their reason corrected the wrong Idea they had
then taken in of God as an old man sitting in heaven, and though they
were satisfied that there was noe cause to feare invisible beings more
in the darke then in the light, yet that these notions were apt still
upon any occasion to start up first in their prepossesd phansys and not
to be removed without some pains.  LOCKE-E3-P2,72.116

And to let you see how lasting frightfull images are that take place
in the minde earely, I shall here tell you a pretty remarkeable but
true story.  LOCKE-E3-P2,72.117

There was in Glocester a man of a disturbd brain whom the boys used to
tease when he came in their way in the streets.  LOCKE-E3-P2,72.118

This fellow one day seeing in the street one of the lads that used to
vex him stepd <P_73> into a Cutlers shop he was neare, LOCKE-E3-P2,73.119

and there seising on a naked sword made after the boy, who seeing him
comeing soe armd betooke him selfe to his feet and ran for his life,
LOCKE-E3-P2,73.120

and by good luck had law and heels enough to reach his fathers house
before the other could get up to him.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.121

The doore was only latchd, LOCKE-E3-P2,73.122

and when he had the latch in his hand he turnd about his head to see
how neare his pursuer was, who was at the entrance of the porch with
his sword up ready to strike, LOCKE-E3-P2,73.123

and he had just time to get in and clap up the dore $to {TEXT:to_to}
avoid the blow, LOCKE-E3-P2,73.124

but though his body scaped his minde did not.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.125

This frightning Idea made soe deepe an impression there that it lasted
many years, if not all his life after.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.126

For telling this story when he was a man he said that after that time
till then he never went in at that dore that he could remember at any
time without lookeing back, whatever businesse he had in his head,
or how litle soever before he came thither he thought of this madman.
LOCKE-E3-P2,73.127

69.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.128

If children were let alone they would be noe more afraid in the darke
then in broad sunshine.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.129

They would in their turns as much welcome the one for sleep as the other
to play in, LOCKE-E3-P2,73.130

and there should be noe destinction made to them by any discourse of more
danger or terrible things in the one then the other.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.131

But if the folly of any one about them should doe them this harme to
make them thinke there is any difference between being in the darke and
winkeing, you must get it out of their mindes as soon as you can, and
let them know that God who made all things good for them made the night
that they might sleepe the better and the quieter, and that besides him
who is good and kinde there is nothing in the darke, nothing that can
hurt them.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.132

What is to be known more of him and spirits, espetially the evil ones,
they will, doe what you can, come to have notice of and phansys about
early enough and sooner then would be desird.  LOCKE-E3-P2,73.133

<P_74>

Having laid the foundations of virtue in a true notion of a God such as
the creed wisely teaches as far as his age is capeable, and by accustoming
him to pray to him, the next thing to be taken care of is to keep him
exactly to speaking of truth and by all the ways imaginable inclining
him to be good naturd.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.135

Let him know that twenty faults are sooner to be forgiven then the
straining of truth to cover any one by an excuse.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.136

And to teach them betimes to love and be good naturd to others is to
lay early the true foundation for justice.  All injustice generally
springing from a too great love of our selves and too litle of others.
LOCKE-E3-P2,74.137

70.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.138

This is all I shall say of this matter at present; LOCKE-E3-P2,74.139

as your son grows up he will discover his natural inclination, which as it
inclines him more then is convenient on one or tother side from the right
path of virtue ought to have proper remedys applyd, LOCKE-E3-P2,74.140

for few of Adams children are so happy as not to be borne with some byas
in their natural temper, which it is the businesse of Education either
to take off or counterbalance, LOCKE-E3-P2,74.141

but $'t $is {TEXT:tis} in vain to thinke of remedys before we know
the disease.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.142

71.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.143

Wisdome I take in the vulgar acceptation for a mans managing his businesse
ably and with foresight in this world.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.144

This is the product of a good natural temper, application of minde
, and experience togeather, and soe not to be taught children.
LOCKE-E3-P2,74.145

The greatest thing that in them can be donne towards it is to hinder them
as much as may be from being cunning, which being the ape of wisdome is
the most distant from it that can be, LOCKE-E3-P2,74.146

and as an ape for the likenesse it has to a man, wanting what really
should make him soe, is by soe much the uglier, Cunning is only the
want of understanding, which because it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} compasse
its businesse by direct ways would doe it by a trick and circumvention,
LOCKE-E3-P2,74.147

and the mischeif of it is, a cunning trick helps but once,
LOCKE-E3-P2,74.148

but hinders ever after.  LOCKE-E3-P2,74.149

Noe cover was ever made <P_75> either soe big or soe fine as to hide
its self.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.150

Noe body was ever so cunning as to conceale their being soe,
LOCKE-E3-P2,75.151

and when they are once discovered every body is shie, every body
distrustfull of them, LOCKE-E3-P2,75.152

and all the world forwardly joyn to oppose and defeat them, whilst the
open direct wise man has every body makes way for him, LOCKE-E3-P2,75.153

and goes directly to his businesse.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.154

I doe not suspect that your son is like to be of a coverd wily temper,
when I consider his make and from what stock he comes.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.155

I am apt to thinke he will be quite of another strain, LOCKE-E3-P2,75.156

and therefore I will not trouble you or myself any farther concerning
this matter.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.157

72.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.158

The next good quality belonging to a $gentleman is good breeding and
civility, LOCKE-E3-P2,75.159

and though this has the name of good breeding as if peculiarly the
effect of Education, yet I would not have young children much perplexd
about it, I meane about puting off their hats and makeing legs modishly.
LOCKE-E3-P2,75.160

Teach them to be good naturd if you can, and this sort of good
manners will not be wanting, civility being in truth noething but a
care not to show any slighting or contempt of anyone in conversation.
LOCKE-E3-P2,75.161

What are the most allowd and esteemd ways of expressing this is as
peculiar and different in severall countrys of the world as their
languages, LOCKE-E3-P2,75.162

and therfor if it be rightly considerd rules and discourses made to
children about it are as uselesse and impertinent as it would be now
and then to give a rule or two of the Japan tongue to one that converses
only with Englishmen.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.163

Read what lectures you please to your son, such as is his company,
such will be his manners.  LOCKE-E3-P2,75.164

A ploughman of your neighbourhood that has never been out of his parish
will be as soon in his language as his cariage a Courtier, that is
neither will be more polite then of those he uses to converse with.
LOCKE-E3-P2,75.165

And therefor of this noe other care can be taken, LOCKE-E3-P2,75.166

and in good earnest, if I were to speake my minde freely, Soe children
doe nothing out of obstinancy, pride and ill nature, $'t $is {TEXT:tis}
noe <P_76> great matter how they put of their hats or make legs, or doe
it at all.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.167

If you can teach them to love and respect other people, they will as
their age requires it finde ways to expresse it acceptably to every one
according to the fashons they have been used to, LOCKE-E3-P2,76.168

and as to what is becoming in their motions and cariage of their bodys,
a danceing master, as has been said, when it is fit will teach them what
is most becomeing.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.169

In the meane time, whilst they are young people, expect not that children
should be over mindefull of these ceremonys.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.170

Carelessenesse is allowd to that age LOCKE-E3-P2,76.171

and becomes them as well as complements doe growne people,
LOCKE-E3-P2,76.172

or if at least some very nice and not very wise will thinke it a fault,
I am sure $'t $is {TEXT:tis} a fault that should be overlookd and left
to time and conversation only to cure, LOCKE-E3-P2,76.173

and therefore I would not have your son <paren> as I often see children
are <$$paren> molested or chid about it, LOCKE-E3-P2,76.174

but where there is pride or ill nature appearing in his cariage, there
he must be perswaded or shamd out of it.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.175

73.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.176

This that I have said here, if it were well reflected on, would perhaps
lead us a litle farther, and let us see of what influence company is.
LOCKE-E3-P2,76.177

$'T $is {TEXT:Tis} not the modes of civility alone that are imprinted
by conversation.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.178

The influence of company sinkes deeper then the outside,
LOCKE-E3-P2,76.179

and possibly if a true estimate were made of the morality and religions of
the world we should finde that the far greater part of mankinde received
even those opinions and ceremonys they would die for rather from the
fashons of their Country and the constant practise of those about them
then from any conviction of their reasons.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.180

I mention this only to let you see of what moment I thinke company is
to your son in all the parts of his life, and therefore how much that
one part is to be weighd and provided for, it being of greater force to
worke upon him then all you can doe besides.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.181

74.  LOCKE-E3-P2,76.182

You will wonder perhaps that I put Learning last, espetially if <P_77>
I tell you I thinke it the least part.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.183

This will seeme strange in the mouth <paren> though not of a learned
yet <$$paren> of a bookish man, LOCKE-E3-P2,77.184

and this being usually the cheif if not only bustle and stir about
children, that almost alone which is thought on when people talke of
Education, makes it the greater paradox.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.185

When I consider what a deale adoe is made about a litle Latin and
Greeke and how many years are foolishly spent in it, and what a noise
and businesse it makes to noe purpose, I can hardly forbeare thinking
that the parents of children live in feare of the schoolemasters rod and
therefor sacrifice their children to this Moloch to appease his anger.
LOCKE-E3-P2,77.186

How else is it possible that a childe should be chaind to the oar 7 or
8 or 10 of the best yeares of his life to get fee fa fum, bonus bona
bonum, to get a language or two which I thinke might be had at a great
deale cheaper rate of pains and time, and be learnt almost in playing.
LOCKE-E3-P2,77.187

75.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.188

But it will be time enough hereafter to discourse more of that matter,
LOCKE-E3-P2,77.189

only in the meane time give me leave to say I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
with patience thinke that you should put your son into the heard and have
him driven with whip and scourge as if he were to run the gantlet through
the severall classes, Ad capiendum ingenii cultum.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.190

What then, say you, would you not have him read and write?
LOCKE-E3-P2,77.191

Shall he be more ignorant then the Clerk of our parish, who takes Hopkins
and Sternall for the best poets in the world, whom yet he makes worse
then they are by his ill reading?  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.192

Not soe.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.193

Not soe fast, I beseech you.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.194

Reading and writeing and Learning I allow to be necessary, but yet not
the cheif businesse.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.195

I assure you you would thinke him a very foolish fellow that should
not value a virtuous or a wise man infinetly before a great Schollar.
LOCKE-E3-P2,77.196

Not but that I thinke learning a great help to both in well disposd
mindes, LOCKE-E3-P2,77.197

but it must be confessd also that in others not soe disposd it helps
them only to be more foolish or more wicked.  LOCKE-E3-P2,77.198

I say this that when you consider of the <P_78> breeding of your son and
are looking out for a Schoolmaster and a Tutor, that you would not have,
as is usuall, Latin and Logique only in your thoughts.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.199

Let them come in, but in the second place, as subservient only to greater
and more necessary Qualitys.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.200

Seeke out some body that may know how discreetly to frame his manners,
LOCKE-E3-P2,78.201

place him in hands where you may as much as {is} possible secure his
innocence, cherish and nurse up the good, and gently correct and weed
out any bad inclinations.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.202

This is the main point, LOCKE-E3-P2,78.203

and this being provided for, learning may be had into the bargain, and
that as I thinke at a very easy rate, by methods that may be thought on.
LOCKE-E3-P2,78.204

76.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.205

Now that he can talke, $'t $is {TEXT:tis} time, you thinke, he should
begin to learne, learne to read I meane, LOCKE-E3-P2,78.206

but I thinke as to this great care is to be taken that it be never
made as a businesse to him, that he never looks on it as a taske.
LOCKE-E3-P2,78.207

We naturally from our cradles love liberty, LOCKE-E3-P2,78.208

and have therefore an aversion for many things for noe other reason but
because they are injoynd us.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.209

I have always had a phansy that learning might be made play and recreation
to children and that they might be brought to desire to be taught,
if it were proposd to them as a thing of honour, credit, delight, and
recreation, if they were never chid nor corrected for the neglect of it.
LOCKE-E3-P2,78.210

That which confirms me in this opinion is that amongst the Portugeses $'t
$is {TEXT:tis} soe much a fashon and emulation amongst their children
to learne to read and write that they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hinder
them from it.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.211

They will learne it one from another, LOCKE-E3-P2,78.212

and are as intent on it as if it were forbidden them.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.213

And I remember that being at a freinds house whose younger son, a child
in coats, was not easily brought to his book <paren> being taught to
read at home by his mother <$$paren> I advised to trie another way then
requiring it of him as a duty.  LOCKE-E3-P2,78.214

We then by talke with him and discourse on purpose one with another made
him apprehend that it was the priviledg and advantage of Heirs and Elder
brothers to be Schollars, that this made a <P_79> fine $gentleman and
beloved by every body, and that for younger brothers $'t $was {TEXT:twas}
a favour to admit them to that breeding, to be taught to read and write
was more then came to their share, LOCKE-E3-P2,79.215

they might be ignorant bumkins and clowns if they pleased.
LOCKE-E3-P2,79.216

This soe wrought upon the child that afterwards he desird to be taught,
would come himself to his mother to Learne, and would not let his maid
be quiet till she heard him his lesson.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.217

I doe not doubt but some way like this might be taken with other children,
and when their tempers are found, some thoughts be instilld into them that
might set them upon desireing of learning themselves, and they themselves
seeke it as another sort of play or recreation.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.218

But then as I said before it must never be imposd as a taske, nor made
a trouble to them.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.219

There are dice and playthings with the letters on them to teach children
the alpabet {COM:sic} by playing, LOCKE-E3-P2,79.220

and twenty other ways may be found out, suitable to their
particular tempers, to make this kinde of learning a sport to them.
LOCKE-E3-P2,79.221

I would not, I say, have learning made by any means his businesse.
LOCKE-E3-P2,79.222

He should never be driven to it, nor it be imposd on him as a taske.
LOCKE-E3-P2,79.223

I thinke the beginning, which in all things is the hardest, he may be
brought to play himself into, and may be taught to read without ever
perceiving that it is anything but a sport.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.224

Children should not have any thing like worke or serious imposed upon
them.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.225

Their mindes nor bodys will not beare it, LOCKE-E3-P2,79.226

it injures their healths, LOCKE-E3-P2,79.227

and their being forced and tied down to their books in an age at enmity
with all such restraint has, I doubt not, been the reason why a great many
have hated books and learning all their lives after.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.228

$'T $is {TEXT:Tis} like a surfet that leaves an aversion behind not to
be removed.  LOCKE-E3-P2,79.229
