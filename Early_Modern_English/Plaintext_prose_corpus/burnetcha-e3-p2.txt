<P_2,174>

And when he was bid describe the room, it proved to be one of the public
rooms of that court, which are so great, that the queen, who was a woman
of a low voice, could not be heard over it, unless she had strained
for it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.2

Oates, to excuse his saying that he could not lay any thing to the charge
of any beside those he had already named, pretended he thought then it
was not lawful to accuse the queen: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.3

but this did not satisfy people.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.4

Bedloe, to support this, swore that being once in the chapel at Somerset
house, he saw the queen, the duke, and some others, very earnest in
discourse in the closet above, and that one came down with much joy,
and said the queen had yielded at last; and that one explained this to
him beyond sea, and said it was to kill the king.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.5

And, besides Bedloe's oath that he saw Godfrey's body in Somerset house
, it was remembered that at that time the queen was for some days in so
close a retirement that no person was admitted.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.6

Prince Robert came then to wait on her, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.7

but was denied access.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.8

This raised a strange suspicion of her: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.9

but the king would not suffer that matter to go any further.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,174.10

<P_2,175>

While the examinations were going on, and preparation was making for the
trial of the prisoners, a bill was brought into the house of commons
, requiring all members of either house, and all such as might come
into the king's court or presence, to take a test against popery; in
which not only transubstantiation was renounced, but the worship of the
Virgin Mary and the saints, as it was practised in the church of Rome,
was declared to be idolatrous.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.12

This passed in the house of commons without any difficulty.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.13

But in the house of lords, Gunning, bishop of Ely, maintained that the
church of Rome was not idolatrous: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.14

and he was answered by Barlow, bishop of Lincoln.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.15

The lords did not much mind Gunning's arguments, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.16

but passed the bill: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.17

and though Gunning had said that he could not take that test with a good
conscience, yet as soon as the bill was passed he took it in the crowd
with the rest.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,175.18

The duke <P_2,176> got a proviso to be put in it for excepting himself.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.19

He spoke upon that occasion with great earnestness, and with tears in
his eyes.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.20

He said he was now to cast himself upon their favour in the greatest
concern he could have in this world.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.21

He spoke much of his duty to the king, and of his zeal for the nation:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.22

and solemnly protested that whatever his religion might be, that should
only be a private thing between God and his own soul, and that no effect
of it should ever appear in the government.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.23

The proviso was carried for him by a few voices: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.24

and, contrary to all men's expectations, it passed in the house of
commons.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.25

There was also a proviso put in excepting nine ladies about the queen:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.26

and she said she would have all the ladies of that religion cast lots
who should be comprehended, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.27

only she named Portsmouth, as one whom she would not expose to the
uncertainty of a lot; which was not thought very decent in her, if her
circumstances at that time had not required an extraordinary submission
to the king in every thing.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.28

Coleman was brought to his trial.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.29

Oates and Bedloe swore flatly against him as was mentioned before.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,176.30

He denied that he had ever seen either the one or the other of <P_2,177>
them in his whole life: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.31

and defended himself by Oates's not knowing him when they were first
confronted, nor objecting those matters to him for a great while after.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.32

He also pressed Oates to name the day in August in which he had sent
the fourscore guineas to the four ruffians.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.33

But Oates would fix on no day, though he was very punctual in matters
of less moment.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.34

Coleman had been out of town almost that whole month,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.35

but no day being named, that served him in no stead.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.36

He urged the improbability of his talking to two such men, whom he had
by their own confession never seen before.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.37

But they said he was told that they were trusted with the whole secret.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.38

His letters to P. la Chaise was the heaviest part of the evidence.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.39

He did not deny that there were many impertinent things in his letters:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.40

but said he intended nothing in them but the king's service and the
duke's.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.41

He never intended to bring in the catholic religion by rebellion or by
blood, but only by a toleration: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.42

that by the aid that was prayed from France, was only meant the assistance
of money, and the interposition of that court.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.43

After a long trial he was convict: and sentence passed upon him to die
as a traitor.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.44

He continued to his last breath denying every tittle of that which the
witnesses had sworn against him.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.45

Many were sent from both houses, offering to interpose for his pardon
if he would confess.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.46

He still protested his innocence, and that he knew nothing but in the
way of negotiation.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.47

A committee of the house of commons was sent to examine him.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.48

He behaved himself very modestly before them.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.49

He asserted his own innocence, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.50

and took great care to vindicate the duke.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.51

He said his own heat might make him too forward, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.52

for, being persuaded of the truth of his religion, he could not but
wish that all others were not only almost but altogether such as he was,
except in that chain; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.53

for he was then in irons.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,177.54

He confessed he had mixed too much of interest for raising himself in all
he did: and that he had received 2500 guineas from the French ambassador
to gain <P_2,178> some friends to his master, but that he had kept them
to himself.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.55

He had acted by order in all that he had done, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.56

and he believed the king knew of his employment, particularly that at
Brussels: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.57

but though he seemed willing to be questioned concerning the king, the
commons did not think fit to do it, nor to report what he said concerning
it: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.58

only in general they reported that he spoke of another thing, about
which they did not think fit to interrogate him, nor to mention it.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.59

Littleton was one of the committee, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.60

and gave me an account of all that passed that very night:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.61

and I found his behaviour made great impression on them all.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.62

He suffered with much composedness and devotion, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.63

and died much better than he had lived.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.64

It was given out at that time, to make the duke more odious, that Coleman
was kept up from making confessions, by the hopes the duke sent him of
a pardon at Tyburn: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.65

but he could not be so ignorant, as not to know that at that time it
was not in the king's power to pardon him, while the tide went so high.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.66

The nation was now so much alarmed, that all people were furnishing
themselves with arms, which heightened the jealousy of the court.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.67

A bill passed in both houses for raising all the militia, and for their
keeping together for six weeks, a third part, if I remember right,
being to serve a fortnight, and so round.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.68

I found some of them hoped, when that bill passed into a law, they would
be more masters, and that the militia would not separate till all the
demands of the two houses should be granted.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.69

I gave the king notice of the consequence of that bill, and of the
effects it might have.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.70

He rejected the bill when offered to him for his assent,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.71

and thanked me for the advice I sent him.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.72

I waited often on him all the month of December.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,178.73

<P_2,179>

He came to me to Chiffinch's, a page of the back stairs,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.75

and kept the time he assigned me to a minute.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.76

He was alone, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.77

and talked much and very freely with me.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.78

We agreed in one thing, that the greatest part of the evidence was
a contrivance.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.79

But he suspected some had set on Oates, and instructed him, and named
the earl of Shaftesbury.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.80

I was of another mind.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.81

I thought the many gross things in his narrative shewed there was no
abler head than Oates or Tonge in the framing it, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.82

and Oates in his first story had covered the duke and the ministers
so much, that from thence it seemed clear that lord Shaftesbury
had no hand in it, who hated them much more than he did popery.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.83

He fancied there was a design of a rebellion on foot.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.84

I assured him I saw no appearances of it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.85

I told him there was a report breaking out, that he intended to legitimate
the duke of Monmouth.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.86

He answered quick, that, as well as he loved him, he had rather see him
hanged: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.87

yet he apprehended a rebellion so much, that he seemed not ill pleased
that the party should flatter themselves with that imagination,
hoping that would keep them quiet and in a dependance upon himself:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.88

and he suffered the duke of Monmouth to use all methods to make himself
popular, reckoning that he should keep him in his own management.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.89

He was surprised when I told him that Coleman had insinuated that he
knew of all their foreign negotiations, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.90

or at least he seemed so to me.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.91

I pressed him much to oblige the duke to enter into conferences
with some of our divines, and to be present at them himself.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.92

This would very much clear him of jealousy, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.93

and might have a good effect on his brother: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,179.94

at least it would give <P_2,180> the world some hopes, as Henry IV of
France, his grandfather, did, which kept a party firm to him for some
years before he changed.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.95

He answered that his brother had neither Henry $IV $'s {TEXT:IV's}
understanding nor his conscience: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.96

for he believed that king was always indifferent as to those matters.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.97

He would not hearken to this, which made me inclined to believe a report
I had heard, that the duke had got a solemn promise of the king that he
would never speak to him of religion.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.98

The king spoke much to me concerning Oates's accusing the queen, with
the whole progress of it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.99

He said she was a weak woman, and had some disagreeable humours; but
was not capable of a wicked thing: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.100

and considering his faultiness towards her in other things, he thought
it a horrid thing to abandon her.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.101

He said he looked on falsehood and cruelty as the greatest of crimes in
the sight of God.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.102

He knew he had led a bad life, of which he spoke with some sense,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.103

but he was breaking himself of all his faults, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.104

and he would never do a base and a wicked thing.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.105

I spoke on all these subjects what I thought became me, which he took
well: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.106

and I encouraged him much in his resolution of not exposing the queen
to perish by false swearing.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.107

I told him there was no possibility of laying the heat that was now
raised, but by changing his ministry: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.108

and told him how odious the earl of Danby was, and that there was a
design against him, but I knew not particulars.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.109

He said he knew that lay at bottom.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.110

The army was not yet disbanded, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.111

and the king was in great straits for money.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.112

The house of commons gave a money bill for this: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.113

yet they would not trust the court with the disbanding the army:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.114

but ordered the money to be brought into the chamber of London,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,180.115

<P_2,181>

and named a committee for paying off and breaking the army.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.117

I perceived the king thought I was reserved to him, because I would tell
him no particular stories, nor name persons.  Upon which I told him ,
since he had that opinion of me, I saw I could do him no service, and
would trouble him no more; but he should certainly hear from me, if I
came to know any thing that might be of any consequence to his person
or government.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.118

This favour of mine lasted all the month of December 78.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.119

I acquainted him with Carstares's practice against duke Lauderdale,
and all that I knew of that matter, which was the ground on which I had
gone with relation to Staley.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.120

The king told duke Lauderdale of it, without naming me;
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.121

and he sent for Carstares, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.122

and charged him with it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.123

Carstares denied all, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.124

but said that duke Hamilton and lord Kincardine had pressed him to it:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.125

and he went to the king, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.126

and affirmed it confidently to him.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.127

He did not name lord Athol, hoping that he would be gentle to him for
that reason.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.128

The king spoke of this to duke Hamilton, who told him the whole story
as I had done.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.129

Lord Athol upon that sent for Carstares, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.130

and charged him with all this foul dealing, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.131

and drew him near a closet, where he had put two witnesses.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.132

Carstares said somebody had discovered the matter to duke Lauderdale :
that he was now upon the point of making his fortune, and that if duke
Lauderdale grew to be his enemy, he was undone.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.133

He confessed he had charged duke Hamilton and lord Kincardine falsely,
but he had no other way to save himself.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.134

After the marquis of Athol had thus drawn every thing from him, he went
to the king with his two witnesses, and the paper that Carstares had
formerly put in his hand.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.135

Carstares was then with the king, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.136

and was, with many imprecations, justifying his charge against the two
lords: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.137

but he was confounded when he saw lord Athol, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.138

and upon that his villainy appeared so evidently, that the part I
had acted in that matter was now well understood and approved of.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.139

Carstares died not long after under great horror,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,181.140

and <P_2,182> ordered himself to be cast into some ditch as a dog;
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.141

for he said he was no better.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.142

But I could never hear what he said of Staley's business.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.143

While all matters were in this confusion, a new incident happened that
embroiled them yet more.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.144

The earl of Danby had broke with Montagu, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.145

but he knew what letters he had writ to him, and with what secrets he
had trusted him.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.146

He apprehended Montagu might accuse him: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.147

so he resolved to prevent him.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.148

Jenkins, who was then at Nimeguen, writ over, according to a direction
sent him, as was believed, that he understood Montagu had been in a secret
correspondence and in dangerous practices with the pope's nuncio at Paris.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.149

This was meant of one Con, whom I knew well, who had been long in Rome :
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.150

and most of the letters between England and Rome passed through his hands.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.151

He was a crafty man, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.152

but knew news well, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.153

and loved money.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.154

So Montagu made use of him, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.155

and gave him money for such secrets as he could draw from him.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.156

Upon Jenkins's letter, the king sent a message to the house of commons
, letting them know that he was resolved to bring Montagu to a trial,
for being a confederate with Rome, and in the plot to bring in popery.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.157

And at the same time he sent to secure his cabinets and papers: a device
of lord Danby's to find his own letters and destroy them, and then to
let the prosecution fall: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.158

for they knew they had nothing against Montagu.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.159

But he understood the arts of a court too well to be easily catched;
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,182.160

and had <P_2,183> put a box in which those letters were in sure hands
out of the way.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.161

A great debate rose upon this matter in the house of commons.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.162

It was thought a high breach of privilege to seize on the papers of a
member of their house when there was nothing of treason swore against him.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.163

After some hours spent in the debate, during which Montagu sat silent
very long, at last, when the box was brought to him from the person to
whom he had trusted it, he opened it, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.164

and took out two of lord Danby's letters, that contained instructions
for him to treat with the king of France for 300,000 <font> l.
<$$font> a year for three years, if a peace succeeded, since it would
not be convenient for the king to meet a parliament in all that time,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.165

and he was charged to mention no part of this to the secretary.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.166

Winnington, who from small beginnings, and with as small a proportion
of learning in his profession, in which he was rather bold and ready
than able, was now come to be solicitor general, fell severely upon
those letters.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,183.167

He said, here was a minister who, <P_2,184> going out of the affairs
of his own province, was directing the king's ambassadors and excluding
the secretary of state, whose office that was, from the knowledge of it:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.168

here was the faith of England to our allies, and our own interest
likewise, set to sale for French money, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.169

and that to keep off a session of parliament.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.170

This was a design to sell the nation, and to subvert the government:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.171

and he concluded that was high treason: upon which he moved that lord
Danby should be impeached of high treason.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.172

The earl of Danby's party was much confounded: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.173

they could neither deny nor justify his letters, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.174

but they argued that they could not be high treason, since no
such fact was comprehended in any of the statutes of treason.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.175

The letters seemed to be writ by the king's order, who certainly might
appoint any person he pleased to send his orders to his ministers abroad.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.176

They reflected on the business of the earl of Strafford, and on
constructive treason, which was a device to condemn a man for a fact
against which no law did lie.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.177

Maynard, an ancient and eminent lawyer, explained the words of the statute
of 25 Edward III that the courts of law could only proceed upon one of
the crimes there enumerated.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.178

But the parliament had still a power by the clause in that act to declare
what they thought was treason: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.179

so an act passed declaring poisoning treason, in king Henry $VIII $'s
{TEXT:VIII's} time: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.180

and as by the statute it was only treason to conspire against the prince
of Wales, yet if one should conspire against the whole royal family,
when there was no prince of Wales, they would without doubt declare that
to be high treason.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,184.181

After a long debate it was voted by a majority of above seventy voices
, that lord Danby should be impeached <P_2,185> of high treason,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.182

and the impeachment was next day carried up to the lords.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.183

The earl of Danby justified himself, that he had served the king
faithfully, and according to his own orders.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.184

And he produced some of Montagu's letters, to shew that at the
court of France he was looked on as an enemy to their interest.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.185

He said they knew him well that judged so of him;
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.186

for he was indeed an enemy to it, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.187

and among other reasons he gave this for one, that he knew the French
king held both the king's person and government under the last degree
of contempt.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.188

These words were thought very strange with relation to both kings.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.189

A great debate arose in the house of lords concerning the impeachment
; whether it ought to be received as an impeachment of high treason
, only because the commons added the word high treason in it.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.190

It was said, the utmost could be made of it was to suppose it true:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.191

but even in that case they must needs say plainly, that was not within
the statute.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.192

To this it was answered, that the house of commons that brought up the
impeachment were to be heard to two points: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.193

the one was, to the nature of the crime: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.194

the other was, to the trial of it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.195

But the lords could not take upon them to judge of either of these,
till they heard what the commons could offer to support the charge.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,185.196

They were bound therefore to receive the charge, and to proceed
according to the rules of parliament, which <P_2,186> was to commit
the person so impeached, and then give a short day for his trial:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.197

so it would be soon over if the commons could not prove the matter
charged to be high treason.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.198

The debate went on with great heat on both sides:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.199

but the majority was against the commitment.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.200

Upon this it was visible the commons would have complained that the
lords denied them justice: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.201

so there was no hope of making up the matter, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.202

and upon that the parliament was prorogued.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.203

This was variously censured.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.204

The court condemned Montagu for revealing the king's secrets.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.205

Others said, that since lord Danby began to fall on him it was reasonable
and natural for him to defend himself.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.206

The letters did cast a very great blemish not only on lord Danby but
on the king, who, after he had entered into alliances, and had received
great supplies from his people to carry on a war, was thus treating with
France for money, which could not be asked or obtained from France on
any other account, but that of making the confederates accept of lower
terms than otherwise they would have stood on; which was indeed the
selling of the allies and of the public faith.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.207

All that the court said in excuse for this was, that since the king saw
a peace was resolved on, after he had put himself to so great a charge
to prepare for war, it was reasonable for him to seek to be reimbursed
as much as could be from France.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.208

This was ordinary in all treaties, where the prince that desired a peace
was made to buy it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.209

This indeed would have justified the king, if it had been demanded above
board: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,186.210

but such underhand dealing was mean and <P_2,187> dishonourable:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.211

and it was said, that the States went in to the peace with such
unreasonable earnestness upon the knowledge, or at least the suspicion,
that they had of such practices.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.212

This gave a new wound to the king's credit abroad,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.213

or rather it opened the old one: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.214

for indeed after our breaking both the treaty of Breda and
the triple alliance, we had not much credit to lose abroad.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.215

None gained so much by this discovery as secretary Coventry; since
it now appeared that he was not trusted with those ill practices.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.216

He had been severely fallen on for the famed saying of the murder of
forty men.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.217

Birch aggravated the matter heavily, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.218

and said it seemed he thought the murder of forty men a very small matter,
since he would rather be guilty of it than oppose an alliance made upon
such treacherous views.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.219

Coventry answered, that he always spoke to them sincerely, and as he
thought; and that if an angel from heaven should come and say otherwise
, <paren> at this they were very attentive, to see how he could close
a period so strangely begun, <$$paren> he was sure he should never
get back to heaven again, but should be a fallen and a lying angel.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.220

Now the matter was well understood, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.221

and his credit was set on a sure foot.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.222

After the prorogation, the earl of Danby saw the king's affairs and the
state of the nation required a speedy session.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.223

He saw little hope of recovering himself with that parliament, whence so
great a majority was already so deeply engaged: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.224

so he entered into a treaty with some of the country party for a new
parliament.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.225

He also undertook to get the duke to be sent out of the way against the
time of its meeting.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.226

Lord Holles, Littleton, Boscawen, and Hampden were spoke to.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,187.227

They were all so apprehensive of the continuance of that parliament,
and that another set of ministers would be able to manage them as the
court pleased, that they did undertake to save him, if he could <P_2,188>
bring these things about; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.228

but it was understood that he must quit his post, and withdraw from
affairs.  Upon which they promised their assistance to carry off his
impeachment with a mild censure.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.229

The duke went into the advice of a dissolution upon other grounds.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.230

He thought the house of commons had engaged with so much heat in the
matter of the plot, that they could never be brought off, or be made
more gentle in the matter of religion.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.231

He thought a new parliament would act in a milder strain, and not fly so
high; or that they would give no money, and so the king and they would
break: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.232

for he dreaded nothing so much as the bargains that were made with the
present parliament, in which popery was always to be the sacrifice.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.233

Thus both the duke and lord Danby joined in advising a dissolution , which
was not resolved on till the January following.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.234

In December, Ireland, Whitebread, and Fenwick, three Jesuits, and Grove
and Pickering, two of the servants in the queen's chapel, were brought
to their trial.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.235

Oates and Bedloe swore home against Ireland, that in August last he had
given particular orders about killing the king.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.236

Oates swore the same against the other Jesuits, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.237

but Bedloe swore only upon hearsay against them.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.238

So, though they had pleaded to their indictment, and the jury was sworn ,
and the witnesses examined, yet, when the evidence was not found full,
their trial was put off to another time, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.239

and the jury was not charged with them.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.240

This looked as if it was resolved that they must not be acquitted.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.241

I complained of this to Jones, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.242

but he said they had precedents for it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.243

I always thought that a precedent against reason signified no
more but that the like injustice had been done once before.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.244

And the truth is, the crown has, or at least had, such advantages
in trials of treason, that it seems strange how any person was ever
acquitted.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,188.245

Ireland, in his own defence, proved by many witnesses that he went from
<P_2,189> London on the second of August to Staffordshire, and did not
come back till the twelfth of September; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.246

yet, in opposition to that, a woman swore that she saw him in London
about the middle of August.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.247

So, since he might have come up post in one day, and gone down in another,
this did not satisfy.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.248

Oates and Bedloe swore against Grove and Pickering that they had
undertaken to shoot the king at Windsor; that Grove was to have
1500 <font> l <$$font> for it, and that Pickering chose thirty
thousand masses, which at a shilling a mass amounted to the same sum.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.249

They attempted it three several times with a pistol:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.250

once the flint was loose, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.251

at another time there was no powder in the pan, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.252

and the third time the pistol was charged only with bullets.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.253

This was strange stuff; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.254

but all was imputed to a special providence of God,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.255

and the whole evidence was believed.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.256

So they were convicted, condemned, and executed; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.257

but denied to the last every particular that was sworn against them.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.258

This began to shake the credit of the evidence, when a more composed
and credible person came in to support it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.259

One Dugdale, that had been the lord Aston's bailie, and lived in a fair
reputation in the country, was put in prison for refusing the oaths of
allegiance and supremacy.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,189.260

<P_2,190>

He did then, with many imprecations on himself, deny that he knew of
any plot; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.262

but afterwards he made a great discovery of a correspondence that Evers,
the lord Aston's Jesuit, held with the Jesuits in London; who had writ
much to Evers of the design of killing the king, and desired him to find
out men proper for executing it, whether they were gentlemen or not.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.263

This, he swore, was writ plain in a letter from Whitebread, the
provincial, directed to himself, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.264

but he knew it was meant for Evers.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.265

He and Govan, another Jesuit, pressed this Dugdale to undertake it:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.266

they promised he should be canonized for it, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.267

and the lord Stafford offered him 500 <font> l. <$$font> if he
would set about it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.268

He was a man of sense and temper, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.269

and behaved himself decently, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.270

and had somewhat in his air and deportment that disposed people to
believe him: so that the king himself began to think there was somewhat
in the plot, though he had very little regard either to Oates or Bedloe.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.271

Dugdale's evidence was much confirmed by one circumstance.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.272

He had talked of a justice of peace in Westminster that was killed, on the
Tuesday after Godfrey was missed: so that the news of this must have been
writ from London on the Saturday night's post.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.273

He did not think it was a secret: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.274

and so he had talked it as news in an alehouse.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.275

The two persons to whom he said he spoke it remembered nothing of it,
the one being the minister of the parish: BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.276

but several others swore they had heard it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.277

He saw this, as he swore, in a letter writ by Harcourt the Jesuit to
Evers, in which Godfrey was named.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,190.278

But he added a strange story to this, which he said Evers told him
afterwards; that the duke had sent to Coleman when he was in Newgate
to persuade him to discover nothing, and that he desired to know of
him whether he had ever discovered it to any other person; and that
Coleman sent back answer, that he had spoke of it to Godfrey, but to
no <P_2,191> other man: upon which the duke gave order to kill him.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.279

This was never made public till the lord Stafford's trial:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.280

and I was amazed to see such a thing break out after so long a silence,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.281

and it looked like an addition to Dugdale's first evidence, though he had
been noted for that, as having brought out all his discoveries at once.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.282

But the earl of Essex told me he swore it on his first examination,
but since it was only upon hearsay from Evers, and so was nothing in
law, and yet would heighten the fury against the duke, the king charged
Dugdale to say nothing of it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.283

At the same time a particular discovery was made of Godfrey's murder.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.284

Prance, a goldsmith that wrought for the queen's chapel, had gone
from his house for two or three days the week before the murder;
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.285

and one that lodged in his house, calling that to mind upon Bedloe's
swearing he saw the body in Somerset house, fancied that this was the
time in which he was from home, and that he might be concerned in that
matter; though it appeared afterwards that his absence was the week
before, and he said he went from his own house fearing to be put in
prison, as many were upon suspicion, or on the account of his religion.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.286

Yet upon this information he was seized on, and carried to Westminster.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.287

Bedloe accidentally passed by, not knowing any thing concerning him:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.288

and at first sight he charged some to seize on him,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.289

for he was one of those whom he saw about Godfrey's body:
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.290

yet he denied every thing for some days.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.291

Afterwards he confessed he was in it, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,191.292

<P_2,192>

and he gave this account of it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.294

Girald and Kelly, two priests, engaged him and three others into it; who
were Green, that belonged to the queen's chapel, Hill, that had served
Godden the most celebrated writer among them, and Berry, the porter of
Somerset house.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.295

He said, these all, except Berry, had several meetings, in which
the priests persuaded them it was no sin, but a meritorious action,
to despatch Godfrey, who had been a busy man in taking depositions
against them, and that the taking him off would terrify others.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.296

Prance named an alehouse where they used to meet,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.297

and the people of that house did confirm this of their meeting there.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.298

After they had resolved on it, they followed him for several days.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.299

The morning before they killed him, Hill went to his house, to see if
he was yet at home, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.300

they stayed his coming out.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.301

This was confirmed by the maid, who upon Hill's being taken went to
Newgate, and in a crowd of prisoners distinguished him, and said he was
the person that had asked for her master the morning before he was lost.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.302

And then he said they dogged him into a place near St. Clement's
church, where he was kept till night.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.303

This laid the suspicion still heavier on the duke of Norfolk.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.304

Prance was appointed to be at Somerset house at night,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.305

and, as Godfrey went by the water gate, two of them pretended to be hot
in a quarrel, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.306

and one run out to call a justice of peace, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.307

and so he pressed Godfrey to go in and part them.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.308

He was not easily prevailed on to do it, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.309

yet did at last.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.310

Green then got behind him, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.311

and pulled a cravat about his neck, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.312

and drew him down to the ground, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.313

and strangled him.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.314

Upon that Girald would have run him through, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.315

but the rest diverted him from that, by representing the danger of a
discovery by the blood's being seen there.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.316

Upon that they carried up his body to Godden's room, of which Hill had
the key, he being then in France.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,192.317

Two days after, they removed it to a room <P_2,193> cross the upper court
, which he could never describe particularly; BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.318

and that not being found a convenient place, they carried it back to
Godden's lodgings.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.319

At last it was resolved to carry it out in the night, in a sedan, to
the remote parts of the town, and from thence to cast it in some ditch.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.320

On Wednesday a sedan was provided, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.321

and one of the centinels swore he saw a sedan carried in,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.322

but none saw it brought out.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.323

Prance said they carried him out, and that Green had provided a horse
, on whose back he laid him when they had got clear of the town,
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.324

and then he carried him as he believed to the place where his body
was found.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.325

This was a consisting story, which was supported in some circumstances
by collateral proofs.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.326

He added another particular, that some days after the fact those who
had been concerned in it, and two others who were in on the secret,
appoointed to meet at Bow, where they talked much of that matter.
BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.327

This was confirmed by a servant of that house, who was coming in and
out to them, and heard them often mention Godfrey's name; upon which he
stood at the door out of curiosity to hearken, BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.328

but one of them came out BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.329

and threatened him for it.  BURNETCHA-E3-P2,2,193.330
