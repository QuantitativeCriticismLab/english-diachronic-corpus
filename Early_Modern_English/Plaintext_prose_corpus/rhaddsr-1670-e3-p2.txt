A few daies will prepare us to goe to seeke y=e= Hollanders, who are out.

On bord the Royall James, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,10.23

Tuesday evening, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,10.25

at anchor neere Dungenesse.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,10.26

My dearest Love, These are to give the an acc=t= of my wellfare and good
health, w=ch= I blesse God I doe injoy.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,10.27

We are now at anchor neere Dungenesse w=th= our whole fleet, consisting
of 80 men of warr, English and French, about 20 or 22 fireships, and
many small vessells besides.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,10.28

We have bine tydeing it up from the Isle of Wind {COM:sic}.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,10.29

Ever since <P_11> Wedensday last the winds have hung easterly.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.30

The Dutch fleet, we heard yesterday, were at y=e= North Forland.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.31

We doe our utmost endeavor to get to them, if they have a mind to
fight us.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.32

To y=e= westwards of y=e= Downes they may easely be w=th= us;
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.33

but we judge there designe is to ingage us amongst the sands
, w=ch= posibly they may be deceaved in there expectation.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.34

God Almighty goe along w=th= us and give us victory over our enemyes.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.35

I know I shall not want thy prayers and the well wishes of all my deare
relations for my preservation.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.36

We have a brave fleet and, in the maine, well mand.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.37

For our parts we doe not complayn, haveing neere 900 men on bord us;
y=e= Duke 1000, I beleive, and upwards.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.38

It is probable, before we ingage, we may have y=e= ships in the river
ioyne w=th= us, w=ch= are 10 or 11 men of warr and 4 fire ships.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.39

I desire we may put our strength in God Almighty; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.40

but soe noble a brave fleet have not bine seene together in our dayes.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.41

I know not how to direct the to answer these, nor where you may send to

RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.44

Thou knowest the imploym=t= I am in is very expensive,
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,11.50

and therfore let me not faile of haveing +L 100 at least of them.

I have some reason to lament the kindnes done me by thy freinds;
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.58

R. James, neare Sowle Bay, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.71

this 21 May, 1672; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.72

Tuesday evening.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.73

My deare Betty, The 18th instant, w=ch= was Satuarday last, I wrote the
by one of the yachts, and as thou advised.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.74

Y=e= next day we saw the Dutch fleet.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.75

We drew ours into a lyne of bataile, the French leading, we in the reare
, all prepared to fight, haveing stav'd and heft over bord all ours,
and I think all the cabins of the whole fleet.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.76

The Hollanders stood over for y=e= Flaunders Banks and y=e= Weelings.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.77

About 7 at night we were up w=th= them in a lyne, as they lay in the
same posture very orderly to rec=e= us; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.78

but, finding it would have bine darke before we could have well began with
them, being about 4 or 5 miles to leewards of us, y=e= wind at W.S.W. ,
we thought it not convenient to ingage them.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,12.79

Y=e= night following, upon there tacking of, we tackt in y=e= reare,
y=e= whole fleet following to keep them to <P_13> leewards of us, as we
did y=t= night by our twice tacking againe.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.80

Yesterday morning it proved a very thick fogge.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.81

We w=th= our division anchored, standing in w=th= the Banks of Flaunders
of Oostend.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.82

About 10 in y=e= morning, upon cleareing up, we wayed anchor, y=e=
Dutch fleet 3 miles to leewards of us.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.83

We stood of RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.84

and mett our fleet standing in.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.85

Y=e= Dutch stood of w=th= us.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.86

This day it proved much wind, that we could not fight them; whereupon
we stood in to our shore N.W. , RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.87

and about 1$$2 seas over we anchored all night.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.88

This morneing we saw y=e= fleet again.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.89

We stood of towards them, expecting they would have stood w=th= us;
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.90

but they stood of intending to draw us over amongst those shoulds,
to fight them there.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.91

We keeping our wind, and they bearing away, as we suposed, from y=e=
wind, we lost sight of them.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.92

It blowing hard we tackt, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.93

and now come neare to Sowle Bay, where I supose we may stay a day or
two to watter our fleet.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.94

This day came into us the Katherine, Princes, and Advice, w=th= 2 fire
ships more; soe y=t= I supose we are neerer 90 then fowerscore men
of warr, upwards 25 fireships, amongst w=ch= my unckle R.H.  is come.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.95

The Dutch fleet not soe many men of warr as we, I beleive, by 8 or 10
saile, many small vessels and fire ships.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.96

Had it pleased God yesterday to have given us faire weather, God
assisting, we had given a good acc=t= of o=r= actions; our men briske
and brave and very ready and willing to fight.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.97

The Earle of Bristow on bord w=th= us.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.98

I thinke a fourth part the nobles of England in the fleett.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.99

This I send on shore to Sowle, to take its fortune towards thee.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.100

Being in hast, have not tyme to wright any body else.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.101

If my bro=r= Bradenham be in towne, show him this letter.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.102

, w=th= a case of spiritts, come very opertunely <paren> as he wrights
me <$$paren> to raise my courage, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.103

Pray returne him my kind thanks.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.105

I hope shall survive this war to make him amends.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.106

My deare, I should be glad to heare from the, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.107

but I know not how.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,13.108

I shall not be wanting to give the a constant advice, as
opertunity presents, of my <P_14> wellfare and our actions.

$You $'ll {TEXT:Youl} excuse me to my loveing relations y=t= I wright
none of them.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.110

At present it is fowle weather.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.111

Am glad we gote hither, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.112

for stormy weather may shatter us and disable us more then a bataile.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.113

God Almighty be our guard and defence, RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.114

and give us victory over our enemyes.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.115

His providence hath hitherto prevented our ingageing twice.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.116

His Royal Highness the Duke of Yorke is very zeolus to ingage y=e= Dutch

RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,14.119

this 29th May, 1673; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.127

7 leagues of Oostend.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.128

My dearest Love, These are to give the an acc=t= of God's goodnes to me.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.129

I am very well and in health, praised be His name therfore.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.130

Yesterday, the 28th instant <paren> y=e= same day twelve month they
atacqued us in Sowle bay <$$paren>, we atacqued the Dutch fleet,
consisting of 74 or 76 men of warr and 20 fire ships, as the Dutch
prisoners informe us.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.131

We set upon them in the Schoon Velt, the wind at W.N.W=t=. ,
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.132

but changed to y=e= N.N.E.  in the bataile towards evening.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.133

We buoyed the outward banks w=th= our smacks and ketches,
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.134

and had a smart brush with them from 12 at noone as long as day light
lasted.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.135

The damage we have done them we certainly know not.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.136

Severall of ther ships we disabled, w=ch= we forced into leewards:
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.137

Trump, whose squadron we ingaged w=th= ours, shifted his ship once,
if not twice.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.138

What number of men we have lost in the fleet not yet $known {TEXT:know}
; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.139

I believe not 500.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.140

In our ship not above 20, as I can learne; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.141

some $mortally {TEXT:mortality} wounded, others dismembred.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.142

Amongst our dead men is poore Capt. Wasey, who first lost his
arme close to his shoulders and about 6 howers after dyed of his wounds.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.143

My brother Joseph very well; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.144

was w=th= me last night after y=e= bataile.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.145

My unckle Richard very well: RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.146

he hath burnt his ship; RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,19.147

was faire to burne De Rutter within his length, when they shote his
masts about his eares; for w=ch= indeavoured service y=e= Prince hath
given him one hundred pounds, and gratified <P_20> also his oficers, &c.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.148

I supose we shall not atacque them in that place againe.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.149

Our greatest care was to keepe cleere of the sands in that narrow hole.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.150

Our ship, so tender with a saile that we fought w=th= the watter
some tymes comeing into our lower tire of ports, w=ch= was
very disadvantagious, could not do that service intended by us.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.151

There is severall Cap=ts= killed that we have already an account of;
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.152

I hope no more.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.153

Capt. Finch in the Yorke, Capt. Tempest in the Sweepestakes,
Capt. Fowles in the Lyon; and Capt. Werden, in the
Heneretta, $mortally {TEXT:mortality} wounded.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.154

We have severall of our ships shattered, not above two disabled,
and none, as I heare of, lost, but 2 or 2 {COM:sic} fire ships burnt.
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.155

We ride now w=th=in 3 leagues of the Dutch fleete;
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.156

they ride in the place we atacqued them in, and we in our former birth,
only about 2 leagues further of the shore.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.157

How soone we shall fight them againe $can $not {TEXT:cannot} resolve,
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.158

but in y=e= place they now ride I iudge we shall not atacque them a
second tyme.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.159

I beleive the Prince may shift his ship and goe into some other;
RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.160

but of y=t= in my next.  RHADDSR-1670-E3-P2,20.161

I desire that thanks and prayes may be returned to Almighty God for his
