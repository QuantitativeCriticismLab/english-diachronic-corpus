<P_14>

<font> Nature <$$font> and <font> Religion <$$font> are the <font>
bands <$$font> of Friendships; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,14.2

<font> Excellencie <$$font> and <font> Usefulnesse <$$font> are its
great <font> Indearments: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,14.3

Society <$$font> and <font> Neighbourhood <$$font>, that is, the
possibilities and the circumstances of converse <P_15> are the <font>
Determinations <$$font> and <font> actualities <$$font> of it.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.4

Now when men either are unnatural, or Irreligious, they <font> will not
<$$font> be friends; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.5

when they are neither Excellent nor Usefull, <font> they are not worthy
<$$font> to be friends; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.6

when they are strangers or unknown, they <font> $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be friends <$$font> actually and practically; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.7

but yet, as any man hath any thing of the good, contrary to those
evils, so he can have and must have his share of Friendship.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.8

For thus the Sun is the eye of the world; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.9

and he is indifferent to the Negro, or the cold Russian, to them that
stand near the Tropicks, the scalded Indian, or the poor boy that shakes
at the foot of the Peiphean hills; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,15.10

but the fluxures of the heaven & the earth, the conveniency of abode,
and the approches to <P_16> the North or South respectively change the
emannations of his beams; not that they do not pass alwaies fro~ him,
but that they are not equally received below, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.11

but by periods and changes, by little inlets and reflections, they
receive what they can; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.12

and some have onely a dark day and a long night from him, snowes and
white cattle, a miserable life & a perpetual harvest of Catarrhes and
consumptions; apoplexies and dead palsies, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.13

but some have splendid fires, and aromaticke spices, rich wines, and well
digested fruits, great wit and great courage; because they dwell in his
eye, and look in his face, and are the courtiers of the Sun, and wait upon
him in his Chambers $of {TEXT:of_of} the East; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.14

just so is it in friendships: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.15

some are worthy, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.16

and some are necessary; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.17

some dwell hard by JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,16.18

<P_17>

and are fitted for converse; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.20

Nature joyns some to us, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.21

and Religion combines us with others; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.22

society and accidents, parity of fortune, and equal dispositions
do actuate our friendships: which of themselves and in their prime
dispositions are prepared for all Mankind according as any one can
receive them.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.23

We see this best exemplified by instances and expressions of freindships
and charity: <font> viz. Almes <$$font> and <font> Prayers
<$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.24

Every one that needs relief is equally the object of our charity;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.25

yet we signifie this severally and by limits, and distinct measures:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.26

the poor man that is neer me, he whom I meet, he whom I love, he
whom I fancy, he who did me benefit, he who relates to my family,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,17.27

he rather then another, <P_18> because my expressions being finite
and narrow, and $can $not {TEXT:cannot} extend to all in equal
significations, must be appropriate to those whose circumstances best
fit me: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.28

and yet even to all I give my alms: to all the world that needs them;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.29

I pray for all mankind, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.30

I am greived at every sad story I hear; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.31

I am troubled when I hear of a pretty Bride murdered in her bridechamber
by an ambitious and enrag'd Rival; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.32

I shed a tear when I am told that a brave King was mis-understood,
then slandered, then imprisoned, and then put to death by evil men:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.33

and I can never read the story of the Parisian Massacre or the Sicilian
Vespers, but my blood curdles, and I am disordered by two or three
affections.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.34

A good man is a friend to all the world; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,18.35

& he is not truly charitable that <P_19> doth not wish well, and doe
good to all mankind in what they can; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,19.36

but though wee must pray for all men, yet we say special Letanies for
brave Kings and holy Prelates, and the wise Guides of Souls ; for our
Brethren and Relations, our Wives and Children.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,19.37

The effect of this consideration is, that the Universal Friendship of
which I speak, must be <font> limited <$$font>, because <font> we are so:
<$$font> JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,19.38

In those things where we stand next to Immensity and Infinity,
as in good wishes and prayers, and a <font> readinesse <$$font> to
benefit all Mankind, in these our Friendships must not be limitted;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,19.39

but in other things which passe under our hand and eye, our voices and
our material exchanges; our hands can reach no further but to our arms
end, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,19.40

and our voices can but sound till the next <P_20> ayre be quiet,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.41

and therefore they can have entercourse but within the sphere of their
own activity; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.42

our needs and our conversations are served by a few,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.43

and they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} reach to all; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.44

where they can, they must; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.45

but <font> where it is impossible it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be necessary
<$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.46

It must therefore follow, that our Friendships to Mankind may admit
variety as doth our coversation; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.47

and as by nature we are made <font> sociable <$$font> to all, so we are
<font> friendly <$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.48

but as all $can $not {TEXT:cannot} actually be of our society,
so neither can all be admitted to a special, actual Friendship;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.49

Of <font> some entercourses <$$font> all men are capable, but <font>
not of all <$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.50

Men can pray for one another, and abstain from doing injuries to all
the world, and be desirous to do all Mankind good, and love all Men;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,20.51

Now this Friendship we must pay to all <P_21> because we can,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.52

but if we can do no more to all, we must shew our readinesse to do
more good to all by actually doing more good to all them to whom we can
{COM:no_period_in_text} JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.53

To some we can, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.54

and therefore there are nearer Friendships to some then to others,
according as there are natural or civil nearnesses, relations and
societies; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.55

and as I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} expresse my Friendships to all in equall
measures and significations, that is, as I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
do benefits to all alike: so neither am I tyed to love all alike:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.56

for although there is much reason to love every man; yet there are more
reasons to love some then others, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.57

and if I must love because there is reason I should; then I must
<font> love more <$$font>, where there is <font> more reason <$$font>
; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,21.58

and where there is a special affection and a great readiness <P_22> to
do good, and to delight in certain persons towards each other, there
is that special Charity and Indearment which Philosophy calls <font>
Friendships <$$font>; but our Religion calls <font> Love <$$font> or
<font> Charity <$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,22.59

Now if the inquiry be concerning this speciall Friendship.  1.
<font> How it can be appropriate <$$font>, that is, who to be chosen
to it; 2. <font> How far it may extend <$$font>; that is, with
what expressions signified; 3. <font> How conducted?  <$$font>
The answers will depend upon such considerations which will be neither
useless nor unpleasant.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,22.60

1.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,22.61

There may be a speciall Friendship contracted for any speciall excellency
whatsoever; because <font> Friendships are nothing but Love and Society
mixt together <$$font>; that is, <font> a conversing with them whom we
love <$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,22.62

now for whatsoever we can love any one, for that we can be <P_23> his
friend; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,23.63

and since every excellency is a degree of amability, every such worthiness
is a just and proper motive of friendship, or loving conversation.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,23.64

But yet in these things there is an order and proportion.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,23.65

Therefore 2. A Good man is the best friend, and therefore
soonest to be chosen, longer to be retain'd; and indeed never to
be parted with; unless he cease to be that for which he was chosen.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,23.66

{COM:greek_and_verse_omitted}

But although vertue alone is the <P_24> worthiest cause of amability,
and can weigh down any one consideration; and therefore to a man that is
vertuous every man ought to be a friend; yet I do not mean the severe,
and philosophical excellences of some morose persons who are indeed wise
unto themselves and exemplar to others, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.68

by <font> vertue <$$font> here I do not mean <font> justice <$$font>
and <font> temperance, charity <$$font> and <font> devotion <$$font>
; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.69

for these I am to love the man, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.70

but friendship is something more then that: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.71

<font> friendship is the nearest love and the nearest society <$$font>
of which the persons are capable: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.72

Now justice is a good entercourse for Merchants, as all men are that buy,
and sell; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.73

and temperance makes a man good company, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.74

and helps to make a wise man; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.75

but a perfect friendship requires something else, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,24.76

these must be in him that is chosen to be <P_25> my friend;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.77

but for these I do not make him my <font> privado <$$font>; that is,
my special and peculiar friend: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.78

but if he be a <font> good man <$$font>, then he is properly fitted to
be my correlative in the noblest combination.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.79

And for this we have the best warrant in the world:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.80

<font> For a just man scarcely will a man die <$$font>;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.81

the Syriac interpreter reads it {COM:greek_omitted} <font> for an
unjust man scarcely will a man dy <$$font>; that is, a wicked man is
at no hand fit to receive the expression of the greatest friendship;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.82

but all the Greek Copies that ever I saw, or read of, read it
as we do; <font> for a righteous man or a just man <$$font>:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.83

that is, justice and righteousnesse is not the nearest indearment of
friendship; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,25.84

but for a good man some will even dare to dy: that is, for a man that
is sweetly disposed, ready to do acts of goodnesse, and to oblige
<P_26> others, to do things usefull and profitable, for a loving man,
a beneficent, bountiful man, one who delights in doing good for his
friend, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.85

such a man may have the highest friendship; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.86

he may have a friend that will dy for him.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.87

And this is the meaning of <font> Laelius <$$font>:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.88

Vertue may be despised, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.89

so may learning and Nobility; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.90

<font> et una est amicitia in rebus humanis de cujus utilitate omnes
consentiunt <$$font>: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.91

onely friendship is that thing which because all know to be useful and
profitable, no man can despise; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.92

that is, {COM:greek_omitted}, or {COM:greek_omitted}, goodness or
beneficence makes friendships.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.93

For if he be a good man he will love where he is beloved,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.94

and $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the first tye of friendship.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,26.95

<P_27>

{COM:greek_omitted}

That was the Commendation of the bravest friendship; in <font> Theocritus
<$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,27.98

{COM:verse_and_greek_omitted}

For it is impossible this neerness of friendship can be where there is
not mutual love; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,27.100

but this is secured <P_28> if I choose a good man;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,28.101

for he that is apt enough to begin alone will never be behinde in relation
& correspondency; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,28.102

and therefore I like the Gentiles Letany well.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,28.103

{COM:greek_and_verse_omitted}

But there is more in it then this felicity mounts to
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,28.105

For {COM:greek_omitted} <font> the good man <$$font> is a profitable,
useful person, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,28.106

and $that $'s {TEXT:thats} an effective friendship.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,28.107

For I doe not <P_29> think that friendships are Metaphysical nothings,
created for contemplation; or that men or women should stare upon each
others faces, and make dialogues of news & prettinesses, and look babies
in one anothers eyes.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,29.108

Friendship is the allay of our sorrows, the ease of our passions,
the discharge of our oppressions, the sanctuary to our calamities,
the counsellor of our doubts, the clarity of our minds, the emission
of our thoughts, the exercise and improvement of what we meditate;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,29.109

And although I love my friend because he is worthy, yet he is not worthy
if he can do no good.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,29.110

I do not speak of accidental hinderances and misfortune by which the
bravest man may become unable to help his child; but of the natural,
and artificial capacities of the man.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,29.111

<P_30>

He onely is fit to be chosen for a friend, who can do those offices for
which friendship is excellent.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.113

For <paren> mistake not <$$paren> no man can be loved for himselfe;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.114

our perfections in this world $can $not {TEXT:ca~not} reach so high;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.115

it is wel if we would love God at that rate; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.116

and I very much feare, that if God did us no good, we might admire his
Beauties, but we should have but a small proportion of love towards him;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.117

and therefore it is that God to indeare <font> the obedience <$$font> ,
that is, <font> the love <$$font> of his servants, signifies what benefits
he gives us, what great things he does for us.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.118

<font> I am the Lord God that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt:
<$$font> JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.119

and, <font> does <$$font> Job <font> serve God for nought?  <$$font>
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.120

And, <font> he that comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he
is a rewarder: <$$font> JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.121

all his other greatnesses are objects of feare and wonder;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,30.122

it is his goodnesse that <P_31> makes him lovely:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.123

and so it is in friendships.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.124

He only is fit to be chosen for a friend who can give me counsel, or
defend my cause, or guide me right, or relieve me, or can and will,
when I need it, do me good: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.125

onely this I adde: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.126

into the heaps of doing good, I will reckon <font> <bracket> loving me
<$$font> <$$bracket> JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.127

for it is a pleasure to be beloved; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.128

but when his love signifies nothing but kissing my Cheek or talking
kindly, and can goe no further, it is a prostitution of the Bravery
of friendship to spend it upon impertinent people who are <paren> it
may be <$$paren> loads to their families, but can never ease my loads:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.129

but my friend is a worthy person, when he can become to me instead
of God, a guide or a support, an eye, or a hand; a staffe, or a rule:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,31.130

There must be in friendship something to distinguish it from a <P_32>
Companion, and a Countryman, from a School-fellow, or a Gossip, from a
Sweetheart, or a Fellow traveller: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,32.131

Friendship may look in at any one of these doors,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,32.132

but it stayes not any where till it come to be the best thing in the
world: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,32.133

and when we consider that one man is not better then another, neither
towards God nor Man, but by doing better and braver things, we shall
also see, that that which is most beneficent is also most excellent;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,32.134

and therefore those friendships must needs be most perfect, where the
friends can be most useful.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,32.135

For men $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be useful but by worthinesses in the
several instances: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,32.136

a fool $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be relied upon for counsel; nor a
vitious person for the advantages of vertue, nor a beggar for relief ,
nor a stranger for conduct, nor a tatler to <P_33> keep a secret, nor a
pittiless person trusted with my complaint, nor a covetous man with my
childes fortune, nor a false person without a witnesse, nor a suspicious
person with a private design; nor him that I feare with the treasures
of my love; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,33.137

But he that is wise and vertuous, rich and at hand, close and merciful ,
free of his money and tenacious of a secret, open and ingenuous, true and
honest, is of himself an excellent man; and therefore fit to be lov'd;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,33.138

and he can do good to me in all capacities where I can need him,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,33.139

and therefore is fit to be a friend.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,33.140

I confesse, we are forced in our friendships to abate some of these
ingredients; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,33.141

but full measures of friendship would have full measures of worthinesses
; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,33.142

and according as any defect is in the foundation; <P_34> in the relation
also there may be imperfection: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,34.143

and indeed I shall not blame the friendship so it be worthy, though it
be not perfect; not only because friendship is charity, which $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be perfect here, but because there is not in the world a
perfect cause of perfect friendship.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,34.144

If you can suspect that this discourse can suppose friendship to be
mercenary, and to be defective in the greatest worthinesse of it,
which is to love our friend for our friends sake <paren> for <font>
Scipio <$$font> said, that it was against friendship to say, <font> ita
amare oportere ut aliquando esset usurus <$$font>, that we ought to love,
that we may also sometimes make use of a friend {COM:no_close_paren} :
I shall easily be able to defend my self: because I speak of the election
and reasons of choosing friends: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,34.145

after he is chosen, do <P_35> as nobly as you talk,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.146

and love as purely as you dream; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.147

and let your conversation be as metaphysical as your discourse,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.148

and proceed in this method, till you be confuted by experience;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.149

yet till then, the case is otherwise when we speak of choosing one to
be my friend: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.150

He is not my friend till I have chosen him, or loved him;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.151

and if any man inquires whom he shall choose, or whom he should love,
I suppose it ought not to be answered, that we should love him who hath
least amability; that we should choose him who hath least reason to be
chosen: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.152

But if it be answered, he is to be chosen to be my friend who is most
worthy in himself, not he that can do most good to me; I say, here is
a distinction, but no difference; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,35.153

for he is most worthy in himself who can <P_36> do most good;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.154

and if he can love me too, that is, if he will do me all the good he can,
or that I need, then he is my friend, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.155

and he deserves it.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.156

And it is impossible from a friend to separate a will to do me good:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.157

and therefore I do not choose well, if I choose one that hath not power
; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.158

for if it may consist with the noblenesse of friendship to desire
that my friend be ready to do me benefit or support, it is not sense
to say, it is ignoble to desire he should really do it when I need;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.159

and if it were not for pleasure or profit, we might as well be without
a friend as have him.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.160

Among all the pleasures and profits, the <font> sensual pleasure <$$font>
and the <font> matter of money <$$font> are the lowest and the least;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,36.161

and therefore although they may sometimes be used in <P_37> friendship
, and so not wholly excluded from the consideration of him that
is to choose, yet of all things they are to be the least regarded;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,37.162

{COM:greek_and_verse_omitted}

For there are, besides these, many profits and many pleasures;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,37.164

and because these only are sordid, all the other are noble and fair,
and the expectations of them no disparageme~ts to the best friendships.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,37.165

For can any wise or good man be angry, if I say, I chose this man to be my
friend, because he is able to give me counsel, to restrain my wandrings,
to comfort me in my sorrows; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,37.166

he is pleasant to me in <P_38> private, and useful in publick;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.167

he will make my joyes double, and divide my grief between himself and me.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.168

For what else should I choose?  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.169

For being a fool, and useless; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.170

for a pretty face, or a smooth chin?  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.171

I confesse, it is possible to be a friend to one that is ignorant, and
pitiable, handsome and good for nothing, that eats well, and drinks deep:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.172

but he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be a friend to me;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.173

and I love him with a fondness or a pity, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.174

but it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be a noble friendship.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,38.175

{COM:greek_and_verse_omitted}

<P_39>

<font> Plutarch <$$font> calls such friendships, the Idols and Images
of friendship.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,39.178

True and brave friendships are between worthy persons;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,39.179

and there is in mankind no degree of worthiness, but is also a degree
of usefulnesse; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,39.180

and by every thing by which a man is excellent, I may be profited:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,39.181

and because those are the bravest friends which can best serve the ends
of friendships, either we must suppose that friendships are not the
greatest comforts in the world, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,39.182

or else we must say, he chooseth his friend best, that chooseth such a
one by whom he can receive the <P_40> greatest comforts and assistances.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.183

This being the measure of all friendships; they all partake of excellency
, according as they are fitted to this measure: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.185

a friend may be counselled well enough, though his friend be not the
wisest man in the world; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.186

and he may be pleased in his society though he be not the best natured
man in the world; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.187

but still it must be, that something excellent is, or is apprehended,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.188

or else it can be no worthy friendship; because the choice is imprudent
and foolish.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.189

Choose for your friend him that is wise and good, and secret and just,
ingenuous and honest; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.190

and in those things which have a latitude, use your own liberty;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.191

but in such things which consist in an indivisible point, make no
abatements: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,40.192

That is, you must choose him to be your <P_41> friend that is not honest
and secret, just and true, to a tittle; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,41.193

but if he be wise at all, and usefull in any degree, and as good as you
can have him, you need not be ashamed to own your friendships; though
sometimes you may be ashamed of some imperfections of your friend.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,41.194

4.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,41.195

But if you yet inquire further, whether fancy may be an ingredient in
your choice?  I answer, that fancy may minister to this as to all other
actions in which there is a liberty and variety; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,41.196

and we shall find that there may be peculiarities, and little
partialities, a <font> friendship, improperly so called <$$font> ,
entring upon accounts of an innocent passion and a pleas'd fancy;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,41.197

even our Blessed Saviour himself loved St. <font> John <$$font>
and <font> Lazarus <$$font> by a special love, which was signified by
special <P_42> treatments; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.198

and of the young man that spake well and wisely to Christ, it is affirmed
, <font> Jesus loved him <$$font>: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.199

that is, he fancied the man; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.200

and his soul had a certain cognation and similitude of temper and
inclination.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.201

For in all things where there is latitude, every faculty will endeavour
to be pleased; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.202

and sometimes the meanest persons in a house have a festival;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.203

even sympathies and natural inclinations to some persons, and a conformity
of humors, and proportionable loves, and the beauty of the face, and
a witty answer may first strike the flint and kindle a spark, which
if it fall upon tender and compliant natures may grow into a flame ;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,42.204

but this will never be maintained at the rate of friendship, unlesse
it be fed by pure materials, by <font> worthinesses <$$font>, which
<font> are the food of <$$font> <P_43> <font> friendship <$$font>.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,43.205

Where these are not, men and women may be pleased with one anothers
company, and ly under the same roof, and make themselves companions of
equal prosperities, and humour their friend; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,43.206

but if you call this friendship, you give a sacred name to humour or
fancy; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,43.207

for there is a Platonic friendship, as well as a Platonic love;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,43.208

but they being but the Images of more noble bodies are but like tinsel
dressings, which will shew bravely by candle light, and doe excellently
in a mask, but are not fit for conversation, and the material entercourses
of our life.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,43.209

These are the prettinesses of prosperity, and good-natured wit;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,43.210

but when we speak of friendship, which is the best thing in the world
<paren> for it is love and beneficence; it is charity which is fitted
<P_44> for society <$$paren> we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} suppose a brave
pile should be built up with nothing; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,44.211

and they that build castles in the aire, and look upon friendship, as
upon a fine Romance, a thing that pleases the fancy, but is good for
nothing else, will do well when they are asleep, or when they are come
to Elysium; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,44.212

& for ought I know, in the mean time may be as much in love with <font>
Mandana <$$font> in the <font> Grand Cyrus <$$font>, as with the <font>
Countess of Exeter <$$font>; and by dreaming of perfect and abstracted
friendships, make them so immaterial that they perish in the handling,
and become good for nothing.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,44.213

But I know not whither I was going; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,44.214

I did only mean to say that because friendship is that by which the
world is most blessed and receives most good, it ought to <P_45> be
chosen amongst the worthiest persons, that is, amongst those that can
do greatest benefit to each other; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,45.215

and though in equal worthinesse I may choose by my eye, or ear, that is,
into the consideration of the essential I may take in also the accidental
intrinsic worthinesses; yet I ought to give every one their just value;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,45.216

when the internal beauties are equal, these shall help to weigh down
the scale, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,45.217

and I will love a worthy friend that can delight me as well as profit me,
rather then him who $can $not {TEXT:cannot} delight me at all, and profit
me <font> no more <$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,45.218

but yet I will not weigh the gayest flowers, or the wings of butterflies
against wheat; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,45.219

but when I am to choose wheat, I may take that which looks the brightest
: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,45.220

I had rather see Time and Roses, Majoram and Julyflowers <P_46> that
are fair and sweet and medicinal, then the prettiest Tulips, that are
good for nothing: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.221

And my Sheep and Kine are better servants then race-Horses and Grayhounds
: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.222

And I shall rather furnish my study with <font> Plutarch <$$font> and
<font> Cicero <$$font>, with <font> Livy <$$font> & <font> Polybius
<$$font>, then with <font> Cassandra <$$font> and <font> Ibrahim Bassa
<$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.223

and if I do give an hour to these for divertisement or pleasure, yet I
will dwell with them that can instruct me and make me wise, and eloquent ,
severe and useful to my self, and others.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.224

I end this with the saying of <font> Laelius <$$font> in <font> Cicero:
Amicitia non debet consequi utilitatem, sed amicitiam utilitas <$$font>.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.225

When I choose my friend, I will not stay till I have receiv'd a kindnesse
; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.226

but I will choose such a one that can do me many if I need them:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,46.227

But I mean such kindnesses which make me <P_47> wiser, and which make
me better; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.228

that is, I will when I choose my friend, choose him that is the bravest ,
the worthiest and the most excellent person: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.229

And then your first question is soon answered; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.230

to love such a Person, and to contract such friendships, is just so
authorized by the principles of Christianity, as it is warranted to love
wisdome and vertue, goodnesse and beneficence, and all the impresses of
God upon the spirits of brave men.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.231

2.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.232

The next inquiry is, <font> how far it may extend?  <$$font>
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.233

That is, by what expressions it may be signified?
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.234

I finde that <font> David <$$font> and <font> Jonathan <$$font> loved
at a strange rate; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.235

they were both good men; though it happenned that <font> Jonathan <$$font>
was on the obliging side; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,47.236

but here the expressions were; <font> Jonathan <$$font> watched for <P_48>
<font> Davids <$$font> good; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.237

told him of his danger, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.238

and helped him to escape; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.239

took part with <font> Davids <$$font> innocence against his Fathers
malice and injustice; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.240

and beyond all this, did it to his own prejudice;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.241

and they two stood like two feet supporting one body;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.242

though <font> Jonathan <$$font> knew that <font> David <$$font>
would prove like the foot of a wrastler, and would supplant him,
not by any unworthy or unfriendly action, but it was from God;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.243

and he gave him his hand to set him upon his owne throne.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.244

We find his paralels in the Gentile stories: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.245

young <font> Athenodorus <$$font> having divided the estate with his
Brother <font> Xenon <$$font> divided it again when <font> Xenon <$$font>
had spent his own share; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,48.246

and <font> Lucullus <$$font> would not take the Consularship
till his younger brother had first injoyed it for a <P_49> year;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,49.247

but <font> Pollux <$$font> divided with <font> Castor <$$font> his
immortality; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,49.248

and you know who offer'd himself to death being pledge for his friend;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,49.249

and his friend by performing his word rescued him as bravely:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,49.250

and when we find in Scripture that <font> for a good man some will even
dare to die <$$font>; and that <font> Aquila <$$font> and <font> Priscilla
<$$font> laid their necks down for S. <font> Paul <$$font>; and the
<font> Galatians <$$font> would have given him their very eyes, that is,
every thing that was most dear to them; and some others were neer unto
death for his sake; and that it is a precept of Christian charity, to
lay down our lives for our Brethren, that is, those who were combined in
a cause of Religion, who were united with the same hopes, and imparted
to each other ready assistances, and grew dear by common sufferings,
we need inquire <P_50> no further for the expressions of friendships:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.251

<font> Greater love then this hath no man, then that he lay down his
life for his friends <$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.252

and this we are oblig'd to do in some Cases for all Christians;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.253

and therefore we may do it for those who are to us in this present and
imperfect state of things, that which all the good men and women in the
world shall be in Heaven, that is, in the state of perfect friendships.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.254

This is the biggest; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.255

but then it includes and can suppose all the rest;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.256

and if this may be done for all, and in some Cases must for any one of
the multitude, we need not scruple whether we may do it for those who
are better then a multitude.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.257

But as for the thing it self, it is not easily and lightly to be done;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,50.258

and a man must not die for humor, nor expend so great a Jewel for a <P_51>
trifle: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.259

{COM:greek_omitted} said <font> Philo <$$font>; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.260

we will hardly die when it is for nothing, when no good, no
worthy end is served, and become a sacrifice to redeem a foot-boy.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.261

But we may not give our life to redeem another: unless, 1. The
party for whom we die be a worthy and a useful person; better for the
publick, or better for Religion, and more usefull to others then my self.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.262

Thus <font> Ribischius <$$font> the German died bravely when he became a
sacrifice for his Master, <font> Maurice <$$font> Duke of <font> Saxony
<$$font>; Covering his Masters body with his own, that he might escape
the fury of the Turkish Souldiers.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.263

<font> Succurram perituro, sed ut ipse non peream, nisi si futurus
ero magni hominis, aut magnae rei merces <$$font>; said <font> Seneca
<$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.264

I will help a dying person if I can; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,51.265

but I will not die <P_52> my self for him, unless by my death I save a
brave man, or become the price of a great thing; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.266

that is, I will die for a Prince, for the republick, or to save an Army
, as <font> David <$$font> expos'd himself to combat with the Philistin
for the redemption of the Host of Israel: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.267

And in this sence, that is true; <font> Praestat ut pareat unus, quam
Unitas <$$font>, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.268

better that one perish than a multitude.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.269

2.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.270

A man dies bravely when he gives his temporal life to save the soul of
any single person in the Christian world.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.271

It is a worthy exchange, and the glorification of that love by which
Christ gave his life for every soul.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,52.272

Thus he that reproves an erring Prince wisely and necessarily, he that
affirms a fundamentall truth, or stands up for the glory of the Divine
Attributes, though he die for <P_53> it, becomes a worthy sacrifice.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.273

3 JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.274

These are duty, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.275

but it may be heroic and full of Christian bravery, to give my life to
rescue a noble and a brave friend; though I my self be as worthy a man
as he; because the preference of him is an act of humility in me; and
of friendship towards him; <font> Humility <$$font> and <font> Charity
<$$font> making a pious difference, where <font> art <$$font> and <font>
nature <$$font> have made all equall.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.276

Some have fancied other measures of treating our friends.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.277

One sort of men say that we are to expect that our friends should value
us as we value our selves: which if it were to be admitted, will require
that we make no friendships with a proud man; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.278

and so far indeed were well; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,53.279

but then this proportion does exclude also humble men who are most to
be <P_54> valued, and the rather because they undervalue themselves.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.280

Others say, that a friend is to value his friend as much as his friend
values him; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.281

but neither is this well or safe, wise or sufficient;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.282

for it makes friendship a mere bargain, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.283

and is something like the Country weddings in some places where
I have been; where the Bridegroom and the Bride must meet in the
half way; and if they fail a step, they retire and break the match:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.284

It is not good to make a reckoning in friendship;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.285

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} merchandise, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.286

or it may be gratitude, but not noble friendship; in which each part
strives to out-do the other in significations of an excellent love:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.287

And <font> amongst true friends there is no fear of losing anything.
<$$font> JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,54.288

But that which amongst the old <P_55> Philosophers comes nearest to the
right, is, that we love our selves.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.289

If they had meant it as our Blessed Saviour did, of that general
friendship by which we are to love all mankind, it had been perfect and
well; or if they had meant it of the inward affection, or of outward
justice; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.290

but because they meant it of the most excellent friendships, and of the
outward significations of it, it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be sufficient :
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.291

for a friend may and must sometimes do more for his friend then he would
do for himself.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.292

Some men will perish before they will beg or petition for themselves to
some certain persons; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.293

but they account it noble to do it for their friend,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.294

and they will want rather then their friend shall want;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,55.295

and they will be more earnest in praise or dispraise respectively <P_56>
for their friend, then for themselves.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,56.296

And indeed, I account <font> that <$$font> one of the greatest
demonstrations of real friendship is, that a friend can really endeavour
to have his friend advanced in honour, in reputation, in the opinion of
wit or learning, before himself.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,56.297

{COM:verses_omitted}

<P_57>

But then be pleas'd to think that therefore I so highly value this
signification of friendship, because I so highly value humility.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.300

Humility & Charity are the two greatest graces in the world;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.301

and these are the greatest ingredients which constitute friendship and
expresse it.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.302

But there needs no other measures of friendship, but that it may be as
great as you can express it; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.303

beyond death it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} go, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.304

to death it may, when the cause is reasonable and just, charitable and
religious: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.305

and yet if there be any thing greater then to suffer death <paren>
and pain and shame to some are more insufferable <$$paren> a true
and noble friendship shrinks not at the greatest trials, {COM:sic}
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,57.306

<P_58>

And yet there is a limit even to friendship.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.308

It must be as great as our friend fairely needs in all things where
we are not tied up by a former duty, to God, to our selves, or some
pre-obliging relative.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.309

When <font> Pollux <$$font> heard some body whisper a reproach against
his Brother <font> Castor <$$font>, he kill'd the slanderer with his
fist: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.310

That was a zeal which his friendship could not warrant.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.311

<font> Nulla est excusatio, si amici causa peccaveris <$$font>, said
<font> Cicero <$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.312

No friendship can excuse a sin: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.313

And this the braver Romans instanced in the matter of duty to their
Country.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.314

It is not lawful to fight on our friends part against our Prince or
Country; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,58.315

and therefore when <font> Caius Blosius <$$font> of <font> Cuma <$$font>
, in the sedition of <font> Gracchus <$$font>, appeared against his
Country, when he was taken he answered, that he loved <P_59> <font>
Tiberius Gracchus <$$font> so dearly, that he thought fit to follow him
whithersoever he lead; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,59.316

and begg'd pardon upon that account.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,59.317

They who were his Judges were so noble, that though they knew it no
fair excuse; yet for the honour of friendship they did not directly
reject his motion: but put him to death, because he did not follow, but
led on <font> Gracchus <$$font> and brought his friend into the snare:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,59.318

For so they preserved the honours of friendship on either hand, by
neither suffering it to be sullied by a foul excuse, nor yet rejected
in any fair pretence.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,59.319

A man may not be perjured for his friend.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,59.320

I remember to have read in the History of the Low-countreyes, that <font>
Grimston <$$font> and <font> Redhead <$$font>, when <font> Bergenapzoom
<$$font> was besieged by the Duke of <font> Parma <$$font> , acted for
the interest of <P_60> the Queen of <font> Englands <$$font> forces a
notable design; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.321

but being suspected, and put for their acquittance to take the Sacrament
of the Altar, they dissembled their persons, and their interest, their
design and their Religion, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.322

and did for the Queens service <paren> as one wittily wrote
to her <$$paren> give not only their bodies, but their souls,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.323

and so deserved a reward greater then she could pay them:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.324

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say this is a thing greater then a friendship
can require, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.325

for it is not great at all, but a great villany, which hath no name,
and no order in worthy entercourses; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.326

and no obligation to a friend can reach as high as our Duty to God:
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.327

And he that does a base thing in zeal for his friend, burns the golden
thred that tyes their hearts together; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.328

it is a <font> conspiracy <$$font>, but no longer <font> friendship
<$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,60.329

<P_61>

And when <font> Cato <$$font> lent his Wife to <font> Hortensius <$$font>
, and <font> Socrates <$$font> lent his to a merry Greek, they could not
amongst wise persons obtain so much as the fame of being worthy friends;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.331

neither could those great Names legitimate an unworthy action under the
most plausible title.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.332

It is certain that amongst friends their estates are common;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.333

that is, by whatsoever I can rescue my friend from calamity, I am to
serve him, or not to call him my friend; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.334

and there is a great latitude in this; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.335

and it is to be restrained by no prudence; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.336

but when there is on the other side a great necessity neither
vitious nor avoidable, A man may choose, whether he will or no;
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.337

and he does not sin in not doing it, unlesse he have bound himself to
it: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,61.338

<font> But certainly friendship <P_62> is the greatest band in the world;
<$$font> JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.339

and if he have professed a great friendship, he hath a very great
obligation to do that and more; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.340

and he can no way be disobliged but by the care of his Natural relations.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.341

I said <bracket> <font> Friendship is the greatest bond in the world
<$$font> <$$bracket>, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.342

and I had reason for it, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.343

for it is all the bands that this world hath; JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.344

and there is no society, and there is no relation that is worthy, but
it is made so by the communications of friendship and by partaking some
of its excellencies.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.345

For friendship is a transcendent, JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.346

and signifies as much as <font> Unity <$$font> can mean,
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.347

and every consent, and every pleasure, and every benefit,
and every society is the Mother or the Daughter of friendship.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,62.348

Some friendships are made by <font> nature <$$font>, some by <font>
contract <$$font>, some by <P_63> <font> interest <$$font>, and some by
<font> souls <$$font>.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,63.349

And in proportion to these wayes of Uniting, so the friendships are
greater or less, vertuous or natural, profitable or holy, or all this
together.  JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,63.350

Nature makes excellent friendships, of which we observe something in
social plants; growing better in each others neighbourhood then where
they stand singly: JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,63.351

And in animals it is more notorious, whose friendships extend so far as to
herd and dwell together, to play, and feed, to defend and fight for one
another, and to cry in absence, and to rejoyce in one anothers presence.
JETAYLORMEAS-E3-P2,63.352
