wet Eyes.  MIDDLET-E2-P2,67.758

<font> Exit <$$font> MIDDLET-E2-P2,67.767

<font> Recorders dolefully playing: MIDDLET-E2-P2,67.768

Enter at one Dore the Coffin of the Gentleman, solemnly deck't, his
Sword vpon it, attended by many in Blacke, his Brother being the chiefe
Mourner: MIDDLET-E2-P2,67.769

At the other Doore, the Coffin of the Virgin, with a Garland of Flowres
, with Epitaphes pin'd on't, <P_68> attended by Mayds and Women:
MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.770

Then set them downe one right-ouer-against the other, while all the
Company seems to weepe and mourne, MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.771

there is a sad Song in the Musicke-Roome.  MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.772

T.S.  <$$font> Neuer could Death boast of a richer prize From the first
Parent, MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.773

let the World bring forth A paire of truer Hearts, MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.774

to speake but truth Of this departed Gentleman, in a Brother, Might
by hard censure, be call'd flatterie, Which makes me rather, silent
in his right, Then so to be deliuer'd to the thoughts, Of any enuious
hearer, staru'd in vertue, And therefore pining to heare others thriue.
MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.775

But for this Mayd, whom Enuy $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hurt With all her
Poysons, hauing left to Ages, The true, chast Monument of her liuing
name, Which no time can deface, I say of her, The full truth freely,
without feare of censure MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.776

What Nature could there shine, that might redeeme Perfection home to
Woman, but in her Was fully glorious, MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.777

bewtie set in goodnesse Speakes what she was, MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.778

that Iewell so infixt, There was no want of anything of life, To make
these vertuous presidents, Man and Wife.  MIDDLET-E2-P2,68.779
