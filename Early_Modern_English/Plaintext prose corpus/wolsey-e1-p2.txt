My owne goode mastyr Secretary goyng this day owt of my pue to sey
masse, your lettres datyd yesternygth at London wer delyveryd unto
me, by the contynue wherof I undyrstand that the Kyngs Hyhnes of hys
excellent goodnes and cheryte ys contentyd that I shal inyoy and have
the admynistracon of Yorke merly, with the gyftts of the promocyons
spiritual and temporall of the same; reservyd onely onto hys nobyll
Grace the gyft of v or vj of the best promocons and that hys pleasure
ys I shal leve Wynchester and Saynt Albons.  WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,10.3

As hereonto Master Secretary I can nat expresse howe moche I am bowndyn
to the Kyngs Royal Maieste for thys hys gret and bowntawse liberalyte,
reputyng the same to be moche more than I schal evyr be abyl to deserve.
WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,10.4

Howbeyt yf hys Maieste, consyderyng the short and lytyl tyme that I
shal lyve here in thys world, by the reason of suche hevynes as I have
conceyved in my hert, with the minyuose of the olde howsys, and the
decay of the seyd archbyshoprych at the lest to the summe of viij C
marcke yeerly, by the reason of the Act passyd for fynys of testaments;
with also min long peynful servys and poore <P_1.2,11> degre; and for
the declaration of hys Graces excellent cheryte, yf hys hyhnes be myndyd
I shal leve Wynchester and Saynt Albons wych I supposyd when I made
my Submyssyan, not offendyng in my treweth towards hys royal parson,
dygnyti, or majeste royal, I shuld not now have deservyd to have left ;
WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,11.5

and moche the more knowyng hys Graces excellent propensyon to pyte and
mercy, and rememberyng of the francke departyng with of all that I had
in thys world; that I may have summe convenyent pencion reservyd unto
me, suche as the Kyngs hyhnes of hys nobyl charite shal thynke mete;
so orderyng hys that shal succede and my lyvyng, that the same may be of
lyck value yeerly and exstent.  Wherat my trust ys WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,11.6

and my herte so gevyth me, that hys Majeste wole make no dyfficultie yf
yt may lycke yow frendly to propone the same; assuryng yow that I desyre
nat thys for any mynde, God ys my jugge, that I have to accumulat good
, or desyre that I have to the muke of the world; sen God be thankyd,
at this ower, I set no more by the ryches and promocyons of the world
than by the roshe undyr my fote; but onely for the declaration of the
Kyngs honor and hyhe charyte, and to have wherewith, to do good dedys,
and to helpe my poore servants and kynnysfolks.  WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,11.7

And furthermore that yt wold please the Kyngs excellent goodnes by your
freindly medyacion, consyderyng how slendyrly I am furnyshyd in my Howse
, nowe specially that the apparell <P_1.2,12> of Wynchester and Saynt
Albons $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} takyn from me, to geve and appoynt on
to me a convenyent fernyture for the same, <font> non ad pompam sed

and yf I may have the free gyft and dyssposycion of the benefyces,
yt $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} gretly to my comfort.  WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,12.9

And yet when any of the v or vj princypall shal fortune to be voyd,
the Kyngs Grace beyng myndyd to have any of them, hys hyhnes $shall
$be {TEXT:shalbe} as sure of the same as thougth they wer reservyd.
WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,12.10

And thus by hys nobyl and mercyful goodnes delyveryd owt of extreme
calamyte, and restoryd to a newe fredome, I shall, with Gods mercy
and help, so ordyr my lyff, that I trust hys Majeste shal take special
comfort theran, and be pleasyd with the same.  WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,12.11

the same may be to the Kyngs contentacion; whom I had lever be ded than
to ofende in worde, thowgth, or dede.  WOLSEY-E1-P2,1.2,12.13
