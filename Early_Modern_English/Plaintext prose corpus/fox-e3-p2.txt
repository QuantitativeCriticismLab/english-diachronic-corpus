& this ye bayliffe tolde our frende Peter Younge y=t= they were ye
veryest hypocrites y=t= ever made a profession.  FOX-E3-P2,117.374

And before this there was one Pococke: y=t= marryed ye Lady Dorsett
which Lady Dorsett was convinced FOX-E3-P2,117.375

& this Pococke {COM:8_words_from_"which"_to"_"Pococke"_interlineated}
was a tryer of ye {COM:"ye"_interlineated} preists FOX-E3-P2,117.376

& hee used to call our ffrends house creepers: FOX-E3-P2,117.377

& I comeinge Into his house his Lady saide unto mee: I have somethinge
to speak to thee against my husbande FOX-E3-P2,117.378

nea said I: FOX-E3-P2,117.379

& if ye officers had come in then they had agreed to leave there
preachinge & praynge & fall to there colde meate: FOX-E3-P2,117.385

& I said unto him is not this a shame to you: y=t= persecuted & Imprisoned
us: & <P_118> spoiled our goods because wee wulde not follow you & bee
of your religion & caled us housecreepers & now {COM:"now"_interlineated}
you dare not stande to your owne religion your selves: FOX-E3-P2,118.386

did you ever finde our meetinges stufft with breade & Cheese & tobacco
pipes FOX-E3-P2,118.387

or did you ever reade in ye Scriptures of any such Practises amongst
ye saintes.  FOX-E3-P2,118.388

Why says ye old Pococke ye tryer of ye preists wee must bee as wise as
serpents says hee: FOX-E3-P2,118.389

then said I: this is indeed ye serpents wisedome: FOX-E3-P2,118.390

& whoe would have ever thought y=t= you presbyterians & Independants

as wulde not follow your religion: & now dare not stande to your owne:
but cover it with tobacco pipes flagons of drinke colde meate & breade
& cheese.  FOX-E3-P2,118.391

And this was a common practise amongst y=m= in many places in this
time of persecution to use such deceitefull covers for there worshippe

FOX-E3-P2,118.394

& soe past through ye Countryes visitinge frends till wee came to London
: FOX-E3-P2,118.395

& after wee had visited frends in y=t= Citty & had

free from all other & there relations satisfyed then they might appoint
a meetinge of purpose for ye takeinge of one another: FOX-E3-P2,118.402

& not under 12 faithfull wittnesses.  FOX-E3-P2,118.403
