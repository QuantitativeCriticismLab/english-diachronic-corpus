Than the shyryffe causyd iiij or v horse to be made redy.

Yn the meane tyme he causyd one of hys men to make redye the warrant to
the keapar of Cambrydge castylle.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,196.13

So I thanked hym for $his jentelnes.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,196.21

By thys tyme all thynges were yn a redynes.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,196.22

and bad me fayr wel; dyssyerynge me to be of good cheeare.
MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,196.27

So to Cambryge I came; MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,196.28

and at the townes ende there mete me one Kenrycke, who a lytell before
hade been a prysonar yn the <P_197> marshallesee, as I myselve was;

Than ryd we ynto the towne to an yne called the Gryffyn, bycawse the

Than one of them, whose name was mr. Calton, sayed unto me,
"Sir, yow need not to feare; MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,197.51

for yf there were anye suche thyng, yow shulde have knolege of yt,

but our master wyllyd us, and also commaundyd us, that we shuld

"MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,197.53

Than called they for meate, and wyne; MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,197.54

and when we had wel refreshyd us, we went up to the castell, where they
callyd for the keaper, MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,197.55

but he was not withyn.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,197.56

Than delyveryd they the warrante unto the kepares wyffe, sayenge thus,

"MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.58

and so toke they their leve of me, MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.59

and went their wayes.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.60

Than the kepares wyffe led me up throw the sessyones hall,

MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.77

"Not that I doo knowe of,"sayed I.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.78

MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.82

"I am content, <paren> sayed he, <$$paren> to be your oste to-nyghte ;
MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.83

to morowe yow shall have a newe. "MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.84

Here I calyd to my rememberance the sallutasyons gyven unto me at the
townes end, by the afore namyd Kyndrycke.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.85

So I ryse up, MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.86

caste my cloke abowt me, MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.87

and knellyd downe, cryenge owte unto Almyghtye God, dyssyerynge hyme

comforde me with hys holye sprite yn that agonye, and not to forsake

flatrynge worlde and the weke fleshe, that I had well nye slypte, as
Davyth that holy prophete sayed; MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,198.88

and whan the dead tyme of the nyghte came, nature requyrynge reste,
and I fellynge yn myselve yn shorte tyme yn so greate quyetnes, thorow

MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,199.91

for thy spryte, O Lorde, hathe so sartyffyed me, that whether I lyve or

{COM:insert_helsinki_here}

<P_216>

Now whan as I came to Andwarpe, beynge never there afore, I was amasyd
MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,216.96

At laste I fownde owte the Inglyshe howse, MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,216.98

After that, I toke a howse yn the oxe-marte of a marchawnte callyd Adam

and then came bake agayne to Andwarpe.  MOWNTAYNE-E1-P2,216.108

And there when I set all my doynges yn order, I returnyd home agayn
