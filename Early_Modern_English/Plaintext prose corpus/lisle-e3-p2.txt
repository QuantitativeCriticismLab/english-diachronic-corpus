<P_4.114>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No Doubt of that;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.2

but $pray $thee {TEXT:prithee} tell me, whose Horse didst thou ride when
thou wentest first?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.3

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> The Man's Horse that came to me to desire me to
go on the Message.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.4

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came he to trust thee
with his Horse?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.5

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> The Lord knows, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.6

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Thou say'st right,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.7

the Lord only knows, LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.8

for by the little I know of thee, I would not trust thee with Two-pence
: LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.9

Whose Horse didst thou ride the second time?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.10

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> My own, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.11

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And where didst thou
put thy Horse when thou camest to my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font>'s?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.12

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> In the Stable, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.13

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where did they put their
Horses?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.14

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> They left them without the Gate, I think, my
Lord; LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.15

I did not see them take them in.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.16

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No, thou saidst it was so
dark thou could'st not see any thing: LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.17

Pray were you with the two Men when they did alight?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.18

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> We did all three come together.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.19

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What did you give <font>
Fane <$$font> for his Pains in shewing you the way?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.20

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> He had nothing that I know of.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.21

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well, you are
the best-natur'd and kindest-hearted People that ever I knew:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.22

Whereabouts do you live?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.23

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> At <font> Warminster <$$font>, near my Lord <font>
Weymouth <$$font>'s.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.24

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> Pray, Mr. <font> Dunne
<$$font>, Will you answer me one Question: LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.25

Was not there searching at that time up and down the Country for Rebels
that were fled from the Battle?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.26

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I did hear there was, LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.27

some were taken.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.28

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> But did you hear there was
searching at that time for other of the Rebels?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.29

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I did not hear of any near me,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.30

but there were in other Places.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.31

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then it being such
a suspicious Time, when that little Man with the black Beard came
to thee, didst thou not ask what that <font> Hicks <$$font> was?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.32

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.33

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And when Mr.
<font> Hicks <$$font> and the other Man that is call'd by the Name of
Mr. <font> Nelthorp <$$font> came to thy House, didst not thou
ask their Names?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.34

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.35

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor didst not thou ask upon
what Occasion they were to be conducted to my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font>
's?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.36

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord: LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.37

<font> Hicks <$$font>, the fat Man, told me they were in Debt.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.38

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not the Man that first
came to you, and employ'd you to go on this Message; did not he know
<font> Hicks?  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.39

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell, my Lord.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.40

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not he tell you, <font>
Hicks <$$font> desired you to go, and that he was in Debt, and therefore
desired to be concealed?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.41

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, he did.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.42

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came you to be so
impudent then, as to tell me such a Lye?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.43

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I beg your Pardon, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.44

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You beg my Pardon!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.45

That is not because you told me a Lye, but because I have found you in
a Lye.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.46

Come, Sirrah, tell me the Truth; LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.47

What did <font> Hicks <$$font> and <font> Nelthorp <$$font> with
their Horses, when they came to my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font>'s?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.48

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.49

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why you impudent Rascal
, did not you tell me just now that they left them at the Door?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.50

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I said I believ'd they might,
but $can $not {TEXT:cannot} directly tell what they did with them;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.51

I know not but one or other might have them away, LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.52

but I did not see it.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.53

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee},
Friend, tell the Truth; LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.54

what did become of the Horses?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.55

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell truly, my Lord ;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.56

if any body had them away, I did not see them.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.57

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Where didst thou lie
that Night?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.58

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> In one of the Chambers.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.59

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who shewed thee the Way
to thy Lodging?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.60

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> The Girl.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.61

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Who else didst thou see
in the House?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.62

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> I saw no body at all.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.63

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then who shewed thee the
Way to the Stable, and help'd thee with Horse-meat?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.64

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> No body help'd me to Horse-meat.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.65

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why, thy Horse did not
feed on thy Cake and Cheese, did he?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.66

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> There was Hay in the Rack, my Lord,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.67

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was the Stable-Door lock'd
or open?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.68

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> The Stable-Door was latch'd, LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.69

and I pluck'd up the Latch.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.70

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> How came you to know the
Way to the Stable then?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.71

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Because I had been there before, my Lord.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.114.72

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_1}

<P_4.115>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Perhaps her Questions
might endanger the coming out of all the Truth, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.75

and it may be she is well enough pleased to have him swear as He does;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.76

but it carries a very foul Face, upon my Word.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.77

<font> Then <$$font> Barter <font> was sworn <$$font>.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.78

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Is this <font> Barter?
<$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.79

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.80

for his part we have his Examination before two Justices of Peace;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.81

but we hope he is an honest Fellow, and will tell the Truth.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.82

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is all one whether
you have his Examination or not; LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.83

I expect he should tell me the Truth, and the whole Truth here.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.84

Friend, you know your Soul is at pawn for the Truth of what you testify
to us; LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.85

the other Fellow thou seest has been prevaricating with us all this while,
and swearing off and on, and scarce told one Word of Truth, I know very
well: LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.86

Now I know as much of thee as I do of him, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.87

therefore look to thyself, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.88

and let the Truth, and nothing but the Truth, come out.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.89

<font> Barter.  <$$font> May it please your Honour, my Lord, this Man
<font> Dunne <$$font> came to my House upon the <font> Saturday <$$font>
, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.90

and spoke to me to ride along with him to <font> Moyle <$$font> -s
<font> Court <$$font>, where my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font> liv'd;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.91

and I having no other Business at that time, did go along with him:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.92

He had a Letter in his Pocket, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.93

and I saw him produce the Letter to my Lady's Bailiff, Mr. <font>
Carpenter <$$font>, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.94

but he would not meddle with it, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.95

so I suppose he went in with it to my Lady; LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.96

and while I was in the Kitchen, my Lady came thither, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.97

And asked me, saith she, What Countryman art thou?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.98

Said I, Madam, I am a <font> Wiltshire <$$font> Man.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.99

Saith she, Do'st thou make Bricks?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.100

No, said I, Madam, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.101

I can help in Husbandry-work.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.102

Saith she, If thou could'st make Bricks, I will give the ten Acres of
Ground in such a Place.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.103

I told her no, I could not: LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.104

And then she goes to this Man <font> Dunne <$$font>, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.105

and there she was laughing with him, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.106

and look'd upon me; LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.107

and afterwards when we were going along, I asked him what she laughed at?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.108

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay, and now tell me what
he said to thee about it?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.109

<font> Barter.  <$$font> He told me, my Lord, my Lady asked, whether
I knew any thing of the Concern?  And that he answered her, no;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.110

this the Fellow told me was that she laugh'd at.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.111

After this, I could not eat, nor drink, nor sleep for trouble of
mind, till I had discovered this to some Justice of the Peace;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.112

and I resolved at least to go to Colonel <font> Penruddock <$$font>,
and consult him about it, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.113

so I went over LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.114

and told him of it.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.115

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What did you tell Colonel
<font> Penruddock <$$font>, let us hear?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.116

<font> Barter.  <$$font> Where I had been the <font> Saturday <$$font>
before, and where I should meet them again upon <font> Salisbury-Plain
<$$font> upon the <font> Tuesday <$$font>, LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.117

and we did agree he should come and take them there; LISLE-E3-P2,4.115.118

but afterwards missing them there, or for some <P_4.116> other reason,
I do not know what, his Mind altered, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.119

and he came to take them in the House: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.120

So when I met them, we rode on about ten Miles, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.121

and they would have had me to have led them a private way, over the
fording Bridge towards <font> Moyle <$$font>'s <font> Court <$$font>
, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.122

but I told them, in case they intended to have me for their Guide,
they must go the way that I could tell; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.123

but they would go that private way, and so lose their way;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.124

then they sent back this <font> Dunne <$$font> to <font> Marton <$$font>
to one <font> Fane <$$font>, that was the fat Man that sent him:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.125

but I finding that I was of no more value then, rode away from them,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.126

and having a Relation that liv'd on that side of the country, I went to
let Colonel <font> Pennruddock <$$font> know that they were at the House.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.127

But before I went away from them, <font> Nelthorp <$$font> gave me
five Shillings, half a Crown, and two Shillings and a Six-pence.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.128

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Now thou say'st <font>
Nelthorp <$$font> did: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.129

Didst thou hear his Name named?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.130

<font> Barter.  <$$font> I never could find any of their Names till they
were taken.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.131

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> Pray, <font> Barter <$$font> ,
what Discourse had you with <font> Dunne <$$font> the first time you were
going to and from my Lady <font> Lisle's <$$font> concerning the Men that
he was to bring thither, and what Estates they had?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.132

<font> Barter.  <$$font> My Lord, he said they had half a Score of
Thousands of Pounds a Year a-piece.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.133

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> Did he tell you they were to come
to my Lady's?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.134

<font> Barter.  <$$font> Yes, he told me they were to come upon the <font>
Tuesday <$$font>, and they were to come such a Way, and were to come to
my Lady's in the Evening.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.135

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What wer't thou to have
for thy pains?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.136

<font> Barter.  <$$font> I made no Bargain, my Lord.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.137

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You are all very free,
kind-hearted People, I say that for you.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.138

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> What did <font> Dunne <$$font>
say about his Gains?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.139

<font> Barter.  <$$font> He told me he had a very fine Booty for his
part, and that he should never want Money again, and that I should be
very well paid, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.140

and gave me half a Crown.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.141

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then let my honest
Man, Mr. <font> Dunne <$$font>, stand forward a little.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.142

Come, Friend, you have had some time to recollect yourself;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.143

let us see whether we can have the Truth out of you now:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.144

You talked of carrying a Message from <font> Hicks <$$font> to my Lady
<font> Lisle <$$font>; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.145

Did not you carry a Letter?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.146

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> No my Lord, I did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.147

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not you shew a Letter
to the Bailiff, <font> Carpenter?  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.148

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.149

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What say you, <font>
Barter <$$font>, to that?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.150

<font> Barter.  <$$font> My Lord, I did see him produce the Letter to
the Bailiff.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.151

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then I will ask you another
Question: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.152

Did you not tell <font> Barter <$$font> that you should be at <font>
Salisbury-Plain <$$font>, with two People, upon the <font> Tuesday?
<$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.153

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I said between <font> Compton
<$$font> and <font> Fovant <$$font>.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.154

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did not you tell him,
that they were brave Fellows, and had God knows how many Thousand Pounds
a year a-piece?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.155

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.156

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then one thing more:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.157

Did not you tell him, that you told my Lady, when she asked whether he
was acquainted with the Concern, that he knew nothing of the Business?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.158

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I did tell him so.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.159

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did you so?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.160

Then you and I must have a little further Discourse: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.161

Come now, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.162

and tell us, what Business was that?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.163

And tell it us so, that a Man may understand and believe that thou dost
speak Truth.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.164

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Does your Lordship ask what that Business was?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.165

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Yes, it is a plain Question
; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.166

What was that Business that my Lady asked thee, whether the other
Man knew; and then you answered her, that he did know nothing of it?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.167

<bracket> <font> Then he paused a while.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.168

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Remember, Friend, thou
art upon thy Oath; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.169

and remember withal, that it is not thy Life, but thy Soul that is now
in danger: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.170

therefore I require from thee a plain Answer to a very plain Question;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.171

What was that Business my Lady enquired after, whether the other Fellow
knew, and thou told'st her, he did not?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.172

<bracket> Dunne <font> made no Answer, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.173

but stood musing a while.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.174

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He is studying and musing
how he shall prevaricate; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.175

but thou had'st better tell the Truth, Friend: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.176

remember what thou has said already; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.177

thou hast said, That thou didst tell that Man, that the Lady asked you,
whether he knew any thing of the Business, and thou told'st her, he
did not?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.178

Now I would know what that Business was.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.179

<bracket> <font> Still he made no Answer, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.180

but seemed to muse.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.181

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Look thee, if thou
canst not comprehend what I mean, I will repeat it to thee again;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.182

for thou shalt see what Countryman I am, by my telling my Story over
twice: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.183

Therefore I ask thee once again.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.184

Thou said'st thy Lady asked thee, whether he knew of the Business;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.185

and thou told'st her, he did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.186

Now let us know what that Business was?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.187

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} mind it, my Lord,
what it was.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.188

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But mind me, $pray $thee
{TEXT:prithee}: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.189

Thou didst tell that honest Man there, that my Lady <font> Lisle
<$$font> asked thee, whether he knew any thing of the Business,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.190

and thou said'st, no.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.191

What was that Business?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.192

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> That Business that <font> Barter <$$font> did
not know of?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.193

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Yes, that is the Business
; LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.194

be ingenuous, LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.195

tell the Truth: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.196

Oh!  How hard the Truth is to come out of a lying Presbyterian Knave.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.197

$Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee}, Friend, consider the Oath that thou hast
taken, and that thou art in the presence of a God that $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} endure a Lye, nor whose Holiness will not admit him to
dispense with a Lye: LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.198

Consider that that God is an infinite Being of Purity, Holiness,
and Truth; and it would be inconsistent with his Being to dispense
with the least Untruth; and thou hast called him to witness, that thou
would'st testify the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.199

I charge thee, therefore, as thou wilt answer it to that God of Truth
, and that thou may'st be called to do, for ought I know, the very
next Minute, and there thou wilt not be able to palliate the Truth;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.200

what was that Business you and my Lady spoke of?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.201

<bracket> <font> Then he paused for half a quarter of an Hour,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.202

and at last said: <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.203

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} give an Account of it,
my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.204

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Oh blessed God!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.205

Was there ever such a Villain upon the Face of the Earth;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.206

to what Times are we reserved!  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.207

Dost thou believe that there is a God?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.208

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, I do.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.209

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe, that
that God can endure a Lye?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.210

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I know he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} .
LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.211

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> And doest thou believe
then that he is a God of Truth?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.212

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, I do.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.116.213

<P_4.117>

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou think that the
God of Truth may Immediately sink thee into Hell-Fire if thou tellest
a Lye?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.215

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> I do, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.216

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe, that
he does observe every thing that thou thinkest, sayest, or doest; knows
the Secrets of thy Heart, and knows whether thou tellest a Lye or not,
tho'perhaps it may be hid from us; and knows whether thou dost prevaricate
or not?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.217

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I know, the Lord does know all things.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.218

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou believe, that
he knows the Business that you and my Lady the Prisoner were talking of,
as well as you do; that he hath an Almighty Power over all his Creatures
an all-piercing Eye, that looks into the Hearts of every one of them,
and from which nothing can be concealed?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.219

Dost thou believe it possible to conceal that very Discourse of your's
from the knowledge of that infinite Being?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.220

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I do believe that there is a God above.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.221

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I ask thee then again;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.222

dost thou believe, that that God above, who is a God of Truth himself,
is omniscient, omnipresent, to whom all Truth is naked and open, that
he knows every thing that is either thought, said, or done by any of
his Creatures, sees and knows the Hearts of all Men; LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.223

Dost thou believe all this?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.224

<bracket> <font> He stood silent for a good while.  <$$font>
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.225

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Friend, deceive not thyself;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.226

the great God does observe and know the secret workings of thy Thoughts
now, and how Truth struggles to get out, but Baseness and Villany keep
it in: LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.227

All the private Imaginations of thy Heart are not only known to him,
but registred by him, LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.228

and thy Conscience will bear witness to thy Accusation when thou art
called to answer for them, LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.229

and answer for them thou must; LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.230

for the Scripture, that is the Word of God, tells us, <font> That every
vain Thought we must account for.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.231

Dost thou then believe, that any Discourse between you, tho'
never so private, is private from the Almighty, All-knowing God?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.232

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I know it is not, nor $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.233

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I therefore once more
adjure thee, as thou wilt answer it to that God, that is the Searcher
of the Hearts and Trier of the Reins, to whom all Hearts are open,
and from whom no Secrets are hid, that thou make me a plain Answer to
my Question; LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.234

and as thou hast called God to bear Witness to the Truth of the Evidence
thou givest here in this Court, so I charge thee, in his Name, to declare
the Truth, and nothing but the Truth.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.235

Now tell us what was the Business you spoke of?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.236

<font> But he made no Answer.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.237

<font> L. C. Baron.  <$$font> Friend, mind what my Lord
says to you, LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.238

and consider, how easy a thing it is for a Man to speak Truth, and give
a plain Answer to a plain Question.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.239

You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} but understand what my Lord asks of you;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.240

you said even now, that you did tell the other Witness, <font> Barter
<$$font>, that my Lady asked you, whether he knew any thing of the
Business; and you told her, he did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.241

Now my Lord would have you tell us, what that Business was?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.242

<bracket> <font> He seemed to turn his Head on one side,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.243

but returned no Answer.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.244

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> He is going to ask that
Man there, whether he shall tell the Truth.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.245

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord, I ask no Man any such Question.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.246

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee}
tell us the Truth then now: LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.247

Thou art to know, that thou standest in the Presence of the God of Truth
, and hast called him to witness, that thou would'st tell the Truth.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.248

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I do tell the Truth, as far as I can
remember.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.249

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then what was that you
told my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font>, <font> Barter <$$font> did not know?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.250

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> What <font> Barter <$$font> did not know, my Lord?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.251

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay, is not that a plain
Question?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.252

Of all the Witnesses that ever I met with, I never saw thy fellow.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.253

<bracket> <font> He stood a good while, LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.254

and made no Answer.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.255

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I hope, Gentlemen of the
Jury, you take notice of the strange and horrible Carriage of this Fellow;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.256

and withal, you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} but observe the Sprit of that sort
of People, what a villainous and devilish one it is: LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.257

Good God!  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.258

That ever the thing called Religion <paren> a Word that People have so
much abused <$$paren> should ever wind up Persons to such a height of
Impiety, that it should make them lose the Belief that there is a God of
Truth in Heaven, that sees and knows, observes and registers, and will
punish and take vengeance of Falshood and Perjury.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.259

It may well make the rest of Mankind that have any sort of Faith
in a Deity and a future Life, to abhor and detest both the Men and
their Religion, if such abonimable Principles may be called so.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.260

A <font> Turk <$$font> is a Saint to such a Fellow as this,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.261

nay a <font> Pagan <$$font> would be ashamed to be thought to have no
more Truth in him.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.262

O blessed <font> Jesus!  <$$font> What an Age do we live in,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.263

and what a Generation of Vipers do we live among?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.264

Sirs, Is this that you call the <font> Protestant Religion!  <$$font>
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.265

Shall so glorious a Name be applied to so much Villany and Hypocrisy?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.266

Is this the Persuasion you hope to live, and die, and find Salvation in?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.267

Will any of you all, Gentlemen, be contented to die with a Lye in
your Mouth?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.268

Do not you all expect, according to the Orthodox Doctrine of the Church
of <font> England <$$font>, that eternal Damnation will be the Portion
of Lyars?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.269

And thou wicked Wretch, how durst thou appear to give Testimony before
even an earthly Tribunal with so much Impudence and Falshood, when every
Lye will cost thee so dear, except a sincere and hearty Repentance,
and the infinite Mercy of the great God interpose?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.270

I charge you once more, as you will answer it at the Bar of the great
Judge of all the World, that you tell me what that Business was you and
the Prisoner talked about: LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.271

do you consider what a Condition thou bringest thyself into by all this
Shuffling and Prevarication, even as to any thing of Mercy in this Life
; LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.272

for indeed it is not fit thou shoud'st have the least Hopes of Mercy on
this side Eternity, LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.273

and truly there is no Man can imagine less than infinite Mercy can pardon
so flagitious a Sin, one that so impudently tells and stands in a Lye.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.274

<bracket> <font> Still he would make no Answer.  <$$font>
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.275

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Jesus God!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.276

Was there ever such a Fellow in the World as thou art?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.277

$Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} let me ask thee once again,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.278

Dost thou believe that there is a God, that this God is spotless Truth
and Purity itself?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.279

Dost thou believe thou hast a precious and immortal Soul, that is to live
in everlasting Bliss or eternal Misery after this Life, accordingly as
thou carriest it here; LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.280

if thou doest believe it, ought not the Concerns of that precious and
immortal Soul of thine to be much dearer to thee than ten thousand Worlds?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.281

Does not the blessed Word of Truth tell thee, <font> What will it profit a
Man to gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.117.282

Or what shall a Man give in <P_4.118> exchange for his Soul?  <$$font>
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.283

Is not this the Voice of Scripture itself?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.284

And wilt thou hazard so dear and precious a thing for a Lye, and an
unprofitable Lye too?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.285

Thou Wretch!  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.286

All the Mountains and Hills in the World heaped upon one another, will
not cover thee from the Vengeance of the Great God for this Transgression
of false Witness-bearing: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.287

What hopes can there be for so profligate a Villain as thou art, that so
impudently stands in open defiance of the Omnipresence, Omniscience, and
Justice of God, by persisting in so palpable A Lye?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.288

I therefore require it of you, in his Name, to tell me the Truth.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.289

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell what to say,
my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.290

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Good God!  Was there ever
such an impudent Rascal!  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.291

Well, I will try once more, and tell thee what I mean;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.292

you said you told that honest Man <paren> for truly he seems so to be
<$$paren> that my Lady asked you whether he knew of the Business; and
you told her, he did not: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.293

$Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} be so free as to tell us what the Business was?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.294

<bracket> Dunne <font> paused LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.295

and would make no Answer.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.296

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee}
what didst thou mean, or thy Lady mean, by that Business?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.297

<bracket> <font> He paused again, LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.298

but would make no Answer.  <$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.299

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why, $pray $thee
{TEXT:prithee}, dost thou think thou dost her a Kindness by this way
of proceeding?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.300

Sure thou can'st not think so; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.301

for such a sort of Carriage were enough to convict her, if there were
nothing else.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.302

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Truly, my Lord, I do not think to do her any
Kindness at all.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.303

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then $pray $thee
{TEXT:prithee} let me persuade thee to have some kindness for thyself;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.304

look to thy own Soul that is in great peril of everlasting Ruin and
Destruction by these means; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.305

dost thou call this Religion?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.306

It is a prodigious piece of Religion!  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.307

Come, pray tell me what Business it was you talked of?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.308

You should not have asked me a Question so often, but I would have given
you a plain Answer, though I were not under the Obligation of an Oath,
as {under} you are.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.309

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, pray ask the Question over again once
more, and I will tell you.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.310

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> I will so,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.311

and I will ask it you with all the Calmness, and Seriousness, and Candour,
that {with} I can; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.312

if I know my own Heart, it is not in my Nature to desire the Hurt
of any body, much less to delight in their eternal Perdition;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.313

no, it is out of tender compassion to you that I use all these Words:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.314

I would have thee to have some regard to thy precious and immortal Soul,
which is more valuable than the whole World; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.315

reflect upon that Scripture again which I mentioned before, which
must be true, because it is the Words of him that is Truth itself:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.316

<font> What shall it profit a Man to gain the whole World, and lose his
own Soul?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.317

Or what shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?  <$$font>
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.318

If that Soul of thine be taken away, what is the Body fit for, but like
a putrid Carcase, to be thrust into and covered with the Dust with which
it was made: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.319

Therefore I ask you, with a great Desire that thou may'st free
thyself from so great a Load of Falshood and Perjury, tell me what the
Business was you told the Prisoner, the other Man Barter did not know?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.320

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I told her, he knew nothing of our
coming there.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.321

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nay, nay, that can never
be it, LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.322

for he came along with thee.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.323

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> He did not know any thing of my coming there
till I met him on the way.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.324

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee}
mind my Question; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.325

sure enough thou hadst told him whither thou wert going,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.326

or else he could not have been thy Guide; so that he must needs know of
thy coming there: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.327

but what was the Business that thou told'st her, he did not know?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.328

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> She asked me, whether I did not know that <font>
Hicks <$$font> was a Nonconformist.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.329

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did my Lady <font> Lisle
<$$font> ask you that Question?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.330

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.331

I told her I did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.332

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But that is not my Question
: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.333

What was that Business that he did not know?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.334

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> It was the same thing: whether Mr. <font>
Hicks <$$font> was a Nonconformist.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.335

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be all; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.336

there must be something more in it.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.337

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, it is all; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.338

I know nothing more.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.339

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What did she say to you
when you told her, he did not know it?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.340

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> She did not say any thing, my Lord.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.341

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Why, dost thou think,
that after all this pains that I have been at to get an Answer to my
Question, that thou can'st banter me with such sham Stuff as this?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.342

Hold the Candle to his Face, that we may see his brazen Face.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.343

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I tell you the Truth.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.344

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Did she ask thee
whether that Man knew any thing of a Question she had asked thee,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.345

and that was only of being a Nonconformist?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.346

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, that was all.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.347

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> That is all Nonsense;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.348

dost thou imagine that any Man hereabouts is so weak as to believe thee?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.349

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I am so baulked, I do not know what I
say myself; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.350

tell me what you would have me to say, LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.351

for I am cluttered out of my Senses.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.352

{TEXT:prithee} Man, there's no body baulks thee but thy own self;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.353

thou art asked Questions that are as plain as any thing in World can be
: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.354

it is only thy own depraved naughty Heart that baulks both thy Honesty
and Understanding, if thou hast any; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.355

it is thy studying how to prevaricate, that puzzles and confounds thy
Intellect: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.356

but I see all the pains in the World, and all Compassion and Charity is
lost upon thee, LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.357

and therefore I will say no more to thee.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.358

Mr. <font> Pollexfen <$$font>.  My Lord, because he pretends to
Ignorance what <font> Hicks <$$font> was, I desire to ask Barter one
Question: LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.359

Pray, what did he tell you concerning his Carriage towards these People?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.360

<font> Barter.  <$$font> My Lord, he told me that he had concealed them
in his House ten Days before.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.361

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> That I never did in my Life.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.362

<font> Barter.  <$$font> I know not whether you did or no,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.363

but you told me so; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.364

and I made answer to him again, my Lord, I wonder how he were able
to keep them without being discovered, there being such search;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.365

and he answered, He did keep them in a Chamber all day, and then they
walked out at night; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.366

for the Searches of the Houses were usually at night.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.367

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I can bring testimony to the contrary.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.368

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But really I believe it
will be no strange thing for me to say, I do believe him rather than
thee; LISLE-E3-P2,4.118.369

I would I had half as much reason to believe <P_4.119> thee, as I have
to believe him: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.370

I would fain have thee speak truth, if I could.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.371

What say you to the Question I asked you?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.372

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell what to say,
my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.373

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Say the Truth, Man.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.374

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I do, as I hope for mercy, my Lord.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.375

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Dost thou hope for mercy?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.376

Thou hast very little reason for it, I assure thee.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.377

Well, I will try thee with another Question: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.378

Didst thou tell that Man, that it was the best Jobb thou ever hadst in
thy Life?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.379

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> No my Lord, I did not.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.380

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Nor nothing to that purpose?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.381

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> No, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.382

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What say you, <font>
Barter <$$font>, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.383

did not he tell you so?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.384

<font> Barter.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord, he did; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.385

and that he should never lack Money again as long as he liv'd.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.386

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then I ask you one Question
more, <font> Barter <$$font>; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.387

did you tell this to Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.388

--- <font> Barter.  <$$font> Yes, I did, my Lord.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.389

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Then that will fortify
his Testimony; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.390

therefore swear him, because I would make these concealed Wretches <paren>
for in my conscience I know there are some such in the bottom of this
Business <$$paren> know, that the Truth will out one way or other.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.391

And as for this Fellow, I expect it from all you Gentlemen of the King's
Counsel, and others that are concerned, that you take notice and remember
what has passed here, and that an Information of Perjury be preferred
against this Fellow.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.392

<bracket> <font> Then Col. <$$font> Penruddock <font> was sworn.
<$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.393

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Col. Pennruddock,
upon the Oath you have taken, did that Man, <font> Barter <$$font>,
come to you; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.394

and what did he say to you?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.395

Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>.  My Lord, that Man, <font> Barter
<$$font>, came to my House in the Morning, upon <font> Monday <$$font>,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.396

and told me, he had been with one <font> Dunne <$$font>, upon a Journey
to Mrs. <font> Lisle <$$font>'s House, to get Entertainment for
some People; and that they had appointed to meet him that <font> Tuesday
<$$font> following, between nine and eleven, upon <font> Salisbury-Plain
<$$font>, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.397

and there, if I pleased, I might take them.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.398

I ordered him to go according to the Appointment, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.399

and withal, I sent a Servant of my own to watch when they came by;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.400

but it happen'd, I suppose, by their taking another way, that he missed
of them: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.401

but <font> Barter <$$font> left word, that in case he did not find them
there, we must conclude, that he was gone with them to my Lady <font>
Lisle <$$font>'s House; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.402

and he told me withal, says he, I believe they are Rebels, because he that
desired me to be their Guide, said the same to me.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.403

So early the next Morning I took some Soldiers with me,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.404

and beset my Lady <font> Lisle <$$font>'s House; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.405

it was a pretty while before I could get any body in the House to hear:
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.406

at length that Man that they say was the Bailiff, <font> Carpenter
<$$font>, came out; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.407

and I said to him Friend, you had best be free and ingenous, and discover
who are in your Lady's House, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.408

for I am sure there were some Strangers came hither last Night;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.409

let me know who they are, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.410

and shew me what part of the House they are in.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.411

He did confess to me there were Strangers in the House,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.412

and pointed to such part of the House; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.413

but pray, says he, do not tell my Mistress of it.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.414

Accordingly we went in, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.415

and immediately we took Mr. <font> Hicks <$$font> and this same
<font> Dunne <$$font> in the Malt-house.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.416

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Was <font> Dunne <$$font>
taken in the Malt-house?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.417

--- Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>.  Yes, he had covered himself
with some sort of Stuff there.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.418

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Well, what did you do then?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.419

<font> Col. Penrudduck.  <$$font> My Lady afterwards coming to
us, I told her, Madam, you have done very ill in harbouring Rebels,
and giving Entertainment to the King's Enemies.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.420

Saith she, I know nothing of them; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.421

I am a Stranger to it.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.422

Pray, said I, Madam, be so free and ingenous with me, and so kind to
yourself, as if there be any other Person that is concealed in any part
of your House, <paren> for I am sure there is some body else <$$paren>
as to deliver him up, and you shall come to no further trouble.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.423

She denied it, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.424

and said, I know nothing of them: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.425

But we went on, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.426

and searched, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.427

and at last discovered the other man <font> Nelthorp <$$font>, hid in
a Hole by the Chimney.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.428

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> <font> Dunne <$$font>,
how came you to hide yourself in the Malt-house?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.429

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> When I heard the stir and bustle, I went thro'
the Chamber where I lay, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.430

and came into that Room where I was taken.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.431

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> When thou heard'st a stir
and a bustle, why wert thou afraid of any thing?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.432

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I was frighted at the noise.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.433

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee}
, what need'st thou be afraid, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.434

for thou didst not know <font> Hicks <$$font>, nor <font> Nelthorp
<$$font>; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.435

and my Lady only asked thee, whether <font> Hicks <$$font> were a
Nonconformist Parson: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.436

Thou art a very innocent Soul, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.437

and surely needest no occasion to be afraid.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.438

I doubt there was something of that <font> Business <$$font> in the
Case that we were talking of before, if we could but get out of thee
what it was.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.439

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> My Lord, I heard a great noise in the House,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.440

and I did not know what it meant; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.441

and so I went LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.442

and hid myself.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.443

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Alack-a-day!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.444

That is very strange, that thou should'st hide thyself for a little noise,
when thou knewest nothing of the Business, nor wert acquainted with any
thing of the matter at all.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.445

But Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>, I would ask you one Question
more: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.446

Did that honest Man tell you, that <font> Dunne <$$font> had told him
, that it was the best Jobb that ever he had in his life, and that he
should want no Money: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.447

--- Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>.  I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
tell that truly, my Lord; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.448

I do not remember that: LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.449

but he said, he apprehended them to be Rebels, and that <font> Dunne
<$$font> told him as much.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.450

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What do you say to that,
<font> Dunne <$$font>?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.451

It seems you told <font> Barter <$$font>, that you apprehended them to
be Rebels.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.452

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I apprehend them for Rebels, my Lord!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.453

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> No, no, you did not
apprehend them for Rebels, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.454

but you hid them for Rebels.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.455

But did you say to <font> Barter <$$font>, that you took them to be
Rebels?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.456

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> I take them to be Rebels!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.457

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> You Blockhead, I ask you,
did you tell him so?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.458

<font> Dunne.  <$$font> I tell <font> Barter <$$font> so!
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.459

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> Ay, is not that a plain
Question?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.460

--- <font> Dunne.  <$$font> I am quite cluttered out of my senses;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.461

I do not know what I say.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.462

<font> A Candle being still held nearer his Nose.  <$$font>
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.463

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But to tell the Truth
, would rob thee of none of thy Senses, if ever thou hadst any;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.464

but it should seem that neither thou, nor thy Mistress the Prisoner had
any, LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.465

for she knew nothing of it neither, though she had sent for them thither.
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.466

Mr. <font> Pollexfen.  <$$font> Pray, Col. <font>
Penruddock <$$font>, did you tell her you came to search for Rebels?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.467

Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>.  Yes, Sir, I told her as soon
as I saw her; LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.468

but we had a good while beset the House before any body answered us;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.469

at length, there were some Ladies, or Gentlewomen, I imagined them
to be her Daughters, that upon our noise looked out at the Window;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.119.470

and I told them there were <P_4.120> Rebels in the House,
LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.471

and I required them in the King's Name to be deliver'd to me;
LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.472

but I saw not my Lady till after I had brought out Hicks and <font> Dunne.
<$$font> LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.473

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> What said she to you?
LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.474

Col. <font> Penruddock <$$font>.  She said, she knew nothing of
their being in the House; LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.475

but I told her there was some body else besides, and she would do well
to deliver him without trouble; LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.476

but she denying of it, we search'd further, LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.477

and found <font> Nelthorp <$$font>, as I told you.  LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.478

<font> L. C. J. <$$font> But she denied it first,
it seems?  LISLE-E3-P2,4.120.479
