was the.xviij.  daye of August, we come to Jaffe, and fell to ancre in
the rode there; CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,15.259

Syon to come and se vs co~ducted to Jherusalem, as y=e= custome is, &c.
CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,15.260

Howbeit, notwithsto~dyng all our haste, we lay there in our Galye.vij.

the cause was for he coude no sooner haue the lordes of Jherusalem
and Rama at layser to come to vs, without whose presence and co~ducte
there can no Pylgryme passe; whiche lordes be all Mamolukes and vnder

And after theyr commynge, whan the patron and warden aforesayde hadde

intreated by the Maures, &c.  CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.267

At this Jaffe begynneth the Holy Lande; CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.268

and to euery pylgryme at the firste fote that he setteth on londe there
is graunted plenary remyssion, de pena, and a culpa; CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.269

And in the same Jaffe seynt Petre reysed frome dethe Thabytam, the

and there oure Sauyour Criste called hym CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.273

This Jaffe was so~tyme a grete Cytie, as apperyth by the ruyne of the

but nowe there stondeth neuer a house, but oonly two Towres and certayne

and it was one of the firste Cyties of the worlde founded by Japheth,
Noes sone, CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.277

and beryth yet his name.  CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.278

and come to Rama vpon asses by noon, CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.280

and there we were receyued into duke Phylyps hospytall,
CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,16.281

and it is <P_17> called so bycause duke Phylip of Borgone buylded it of
his greate charyte to receyue pylgrymes therin.  CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,17.282

We founde no thinge therin, but bare walles and bare floures, excepte
onely a welle of good fresshe water, whiche was moche to our comforth;
CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,17.283

neuertheles there come i~to vs Jacobyns and other feynyd cristen

Firste the place where the Jewes wolde haue arestyd and taken awaye the
holy body of our blessyd Lady whan the appostellys bare her to the vale
of Josaphat to be buryed.  CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,18.308

And therby we come into a place where seynt peter, after y=t= he had
denyed our Lord thryes, went out of the house of Cayphas into a caue
and wept bytterly.  CHAPLAIN-E1-P2,18.309

And a lytell from thens we come into the churche of the Aungelles,

From thens we went to a churche of seynt Sauyour, where somtyme stode
y=e= grete house of Cayphas, where as our blessyd Sauyour was scorned ,
his face couerde and bobbyd, and moste greuously betyn, and there suffred

There is also in y=e= same place the moste parte of the grete stone
