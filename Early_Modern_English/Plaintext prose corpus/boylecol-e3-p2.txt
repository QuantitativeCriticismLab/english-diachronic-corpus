EXPERIMENT IV.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,139.3

<$$heading>

But yet I much Question whether that Rule delivered by divers, as well
Philosophers as Chymists, <font> adusta nigra, sed perusta alba <$$font>
, will hold as Universally as is presum'd, since I have several Examples
to allege against <P_140> it: BOYLECOL-E3-P2,140.5

For I have found that by burning Alablaster, so as both to make it appear
to boyl almost like Milk, and to reduce it to a very fine Powder, it
would not at all grow Black, but retain its Pure and Native Whiteness,
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,140.6

and though by keeping it longer than is usual in the fire, I produc'd
but a faint Yellow, even in that part of the Powder that lay nearest the
top of the Crucible, yet having purposely enquired of an Experienc'd
Stone-cutter, who is Curious enough in trying Conclusions in his own
trade, he told me he had found that if Alablaster or Plaster of Paris
be very long kept in a Strong fire, the whole heap of burnt Powder
would exchange its Whiteness for a much deeper Colour than the Yellow
I observ'd.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,140.7

Lead being Calcin'd with a Strong fire turns <paren> after having perhaps
run thorough divers other $Colours <$$paren> into <font> Minium <$$font>
, whose Colour we know is a deep Red; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,140.8

and if you urge this <font> Minium <$$font>, as I have purposely done
with a Strong fire, you may much easier find a Glassie and Brittle Body
darker than <font> Minium <$$font>, than any white <font> Calx <$$font>
or Glass.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,140.9

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} known among Chymists, that the white <font> Calx
<$$font> of Antimony, by the further and more vehement operation of the
fire may be melted into Glass, which we have obtained of a Red Colour ,
which is <P_141> far deeper than that of the <font> Calx <$$font> of
Burnt Antimony, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,141.10

and though common Glass of Antimony being usually adulterated with Borax,
have its Colour thereby diluted, oftentimes to a very pale Yellow; yet not
onely ours made more sincerily, was, as we said, of a Colour less remote
from Black, than was the <font> Calx <$$font> ; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,141.11

but we observ'd, that by Melting it once or twice more, and so exposing
it to the further operation of the Fire, we had, as we expected, the
Colour heightned.  To which we shall add but this one Instance, <paren>
which is worth the taking notice of in Reference to Colours: <$$paren>
That, if you take Blew, but Unsophisticated, Vitriol, and burn it very
Slowly, and with a Gentle degree of Heat, you may observe, that when
$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} Burnt but a Little, and yet so far as that you may
rub it to Powder betwixt your fingers, it will be of a White or Whitish
Colour; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,141.12

But if you Prosecute the Calcination, this Body which by a light Adustion
was made White, will pass through other Colours, as Gray, Yellowish,
and Red; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,141.13

and if you further burn it with a Long and Vehement fire, by that time
it comes to be <font> Ferustum <$$font>, it will be of a dark Purple,
nearer to Black, not only than the first <font> Calx <$$font>, but than
the Vitriol before it at all felt the fire.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,141.14

I might add that <font> Crocus <P_142> Martis <$$font> <paren> <font>
per se <$$font> as they call it <$$paren> made by the Lasting violence
of the Reverberated flames is not so near a Kin to White; as the Iron or
Steel that afforded it was before its Calcinations; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.15

but $I $suppose, $that {TEXT:that_I_suppose} these Instances may suffice
to satisfie you, that Minerals are to be excepted out of the forementioned
Rule, which perhaps, though it seldome fail in substances belonging to the
Vegetable or Animal Kingdome, may yet be Question'd even in some of these,
if that be true, which the judicious Traveller <font> Bellonius <$$font>
affirms, that Charcoales made out of the Wood of <font> Oxycaeder <$$font>
are White; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.16

And I could not find, that though in Retorts Hartshorn and other White
Bodies will be Denigrated by Heat, yet Camphire would not at all lose
its Whiteness, though I have purposely kept it in such a heat, as made
it melt and boyl.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.17

And to manifest, <font> Pyrophilus <$$font>, that Galls are not so
requisite as many suppose to the making Attamentous Liquors, we have
sometimes made the following Experiment, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.18

We took dryed Rose leaves BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.19

and Decocted them for a while in Fair Water, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.20

into two or three spoonfulls of this Decoction we shook a few drops of
a strong and well filtrated Solution of Vitriol <paren> which perhaps
had it been Green would have done as well <$$paren> BOYLECOL-E3-P2,142.21

and immediately the <P_143> mixture did turn Black, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,143.22

and when into this mixture presently after it was made, we shook a
just Proportion of <font> Aqua Fortis <$$font>, we turn'd it from a
Black Ink to a deep Red one, which by the affusion of a little Spirit
of Urine may be reduc'd immediately to an Opacous and Blackish Colour.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,143.23

And in regard, <font> Pyrophilus <$$font>, that in the former Experiments,
both the Infusion of Galls, and the Decoction of Roses, and the Solution
of Copperis employ'd about them, are endow'd each of them with its own
Colour, there may be a more noble Experiment of the sudden production of
Blackness made by the way mention'd in the Second Section of the Second
Part of our Essays, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,143.24

for though upon the Confusion of the two Liquors there mention'd, there do
immediately emerge a very Black mixture, yet both the Infusion of <font>
Orpiment <$$font> and the Solution of <font> Minium <$$font> were before
their being joyn'd together, Limpid and Colourless.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,143.25

<heading>

EXPERIMENT V.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,143.27

<$$heading>

And now I speak of Camphire, it puts me in mind of adding this Experiment
, That, though as I said in Clos'd Glasses, I could not Denigrate it by
Heat, but {COM:sic} it would Sublime to the sides and top of the Glass,
<P_144> as it was before, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.29

yet not only it will, being set on fire in the Free Air, send forth a
Copious smoak, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.30

but having purposely upon some of it that was Flaming, clapt a Large
Glass, almost in the form of a Hive, <paren> but more Slender only
<$$paren> with a Hole at the top, <paren> which I caus'd to be made to
trye Experiments of Fire and Flame in <$$paren> it continued so long
burning that It Lin'd all the Inside of the Glass with a Soot as Black
as Ink, and so Copious, that the Closeness of the Vessel consider'd,
almost all that part of the White Camphire that did take Fire, seem'd
to have been chang'd into that deep Black Substance BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.31

<heading>

EXPERIMENT VI.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.33

<$$heading>

And this also brings into my mind another Experiment that I made about
the production of Blackness, whereof, for Reasons too long to be here
deduced, I expected and found a good Success, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.35

$and {TEXT:an} it was this: BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.36

I took Rectifi'd Oyl of Vitriol <paren> that I might have the Liquor
Clean as well as Strong <$$paren> BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.37

and by degrees mixt with it a convenient proportion of the Essential
Oyl , as Chymists call it, of Wormwood, drawn over with store of Water
in a Limbec, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,144.38

and warily Distilling the mixture in a Retort, there remain'd
<P_145> a scarce credible quantity of dry Matters, Black as a Coal.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.39

And because the Oyl of Wormwood, though a Chymical Oyl drawn by a <font>
Virtuoso <$$font>, seem'd to have somewhat in it of the Colour of the
Plant, I Substituted in its Room, the Pure and Subtile Essential Oyl of
Winter-Savory, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.40

and mixing little by little this Liquor, with <paren> if I mis-remember
not <$$paren> an Equal weight of the formerly mention'd Rectifi'd Oyl
of Vitriol, and Distilling them as before in a Retort, besides what
there pass'd over into the Receiver, even these two clear Liquors left
me a Considerable Proportion, <paren> though not so great as the two
former <$$paren> of a Substance black as Pitch, which I yet Keep by me
as a Rarity.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.41

<heading>

EXPERIMENT VII.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.43

<$$heading>

A way of Whiting Wax Cheaply and in Great Quantity may be a thing of
good Oeconomical Life, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.45

and we have elsewhere set down the Practice of Trades-men that Blanch
it; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.46

But here Treating of Whiteness only in Order to the Philosophy of Colours
, I shall not Examine which of the Slow vvayes may be best Employ'd,
to free Wax from the Yellow Melleous parts, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,145.47

but shall rather set down a Quick <P_146> way of making it White, though
but in very Small Quantities.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,146.48

Take then a little Yellow Wax, scraped or thinly sliced, and putting it
into a Colts-head or some other Convenient Glass, pour to it a pretty
deal of Spirit of Wine, and placing the Vessel in Warm Sand, Encrease
the Heat by degrees, till the Spirit of Wine begin to Simper or to Boyl
a little; and continuing that degree of Fire, if you have put Liquor
enough, you will quickly have the Wax dissolv'd, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,146.49

then taking it off the fire, you may either suffer it to Cool as hastily
as with Safety to the Glass you can, or Pour it whilst $'t $is {TEXT:'tis}
yet Hot into a Filter of Paper, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,146.50

and either in the Glass where it Cools, or in the Filtre, you will
soon find the Wax and <font> Menstruum <$$font> together reduc'd into a
White Substance, almost like Butter, which by letting the Spirit Exhale
will shrink into a much Lesser Bulk, but still retaining its Whiteness.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,146.51

And that which is pretty in the working of this Magistery of Wax, is,
that the Yellowness vanishes, neither appearing in the Spirit of VVine
that passes Limpid through the Filtre, nor in the Butter of VVax, if I
may so call it, that, as I said, is VVhite.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,146.52

<P_147>

<heading>

EXPERIMENT VIII.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.55

<$$heading>

There is an Experiment, <font> Pyrophilus <$$font>, which though I do
not so exactly remember, and though it be somewhat Nice to make, yet
I am willing to Acquaint You with, because the thing Produc'd, though
it be but a Curiosity, is wont not a little to please the Beholders,
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.57

and it is a way of turning by the help of a Dry Substance, an almost
Golden-Colour'd Concrete, into a White one, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.58

the several Tryals are not at present so fresh in my Memory to enable
me to tell you Certainly, whether an Equal onely or a Double weight
of Common Sublimate must be taken in reference to the Tinglass,
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.59

but if I mistake not, there was in the Experiment that succeeded best,
Two parts of the Former taken to One of the Latter.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.60

These Ingredients being finely Powdred and Exactly mix'd, we Sublim'd
together by degrees of fire <paren> the due Gradation of which is in
this Experiment a thing of main Importance <$$paren> BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.61

there ascended a matter of a very peculiar Texture, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,147.62

for it was for the most part made up of very Thin, Smooth, Soft and
Slippery Plates, almost like the finest sort of the Scales of Fishes,
but of so Lovely a VVhite Inclining to <P_148> Pearl-Colour, and of so
Curious and Shining a Gloss, that they appear'd in some respect little
Inferiour to Orient Pearls, and in other Regards, they seem'd to Surpass
them, and were Applauded for a sort of the Prettiest Trifles that we
had ever prepar'd to Amuse the Eye.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,148.63

I will not undertake that though $you $'ll {TEXT:you'l} hardly miss
changing the Colour of our shining Tinglass, yet you will the first or
perhaps the second time hit Right upon the way of making the Glistring
Sublimate I have been mentioning.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,148.64

<heading>

EXPERIMENT IX.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,148.66

<$$heading>

VVhen we Dissolve in <font> Aqua Fortis <$$font> a mixture of Gold
and Silver melted into one Lump, it usually happens that the Powder of
Gold that falls to the bottom, as not being Dissoluble by that <font>
Menstruum <$$font>, will not have its own Yellow, but appear of a Black
Colour, though neither the Gold, nor the Silver, nor the <font> Aqua
Fortis <$$font> did before manifest any Blackness.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,148.68

And divers Alchymists, when they make Solutions of Minerals they would
Examine, are very Glad, if they see a Black Powder Praecipitated to
the Bottom, taking it for a Hopefull Sign, that those Particles are of
a Golden Nature, <P_149> which appear in a Colour so ordinary to Gold
parted from other Metalls by <font> Aqua Fortis <$$font>, that it is a
trouble to the Refiner to Reduce the Praecipitated <font> Calx <$$font>
to its Native Colour.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,149.69

For though, <paren> as we have try'd, <$$paren> that may be Quickly
enough done by Fire, which will make this Gold look very Gloriously
<paren> as indeed $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} at least one of the Best wayes
that is Practis'd for the Refining of Gold, <$$paren> yet it requires
both Watchfulness and Skill, to give it such a Degree of Fire as will
serve to Restore it to its Lustre, without giving it such a One, as may
bring it to Fusion, to which the Minuteness of the corpuscles it consists
of makes the Powder very apt.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,149.70

And this brings into my Mind, that having taken a Flat and Bright piece
of Gold, that was Refin'd by a Curious and Skilfull Person on purpose
to Trye to what height of Purity Gold could be brought by Art, I found
that this very piece, as Glorious as it look'd, being rubb'd a little
upon a piece of fine clean Linnen, did sully it with a kind of Black;
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,149.71

and this like I have observ'd in Refin'd Silver, which I therefore
mention, because I formerly suspected that the Impurity of the Metall
might have been the only Cause of what I have divers times observ'd in
wearing Silver-hilted Swords, Namely, that <P_150> where they rubb'd
upon my Clothes, if they were of a Light-Colour'd Cloath, the Affriction
would quickly Black them; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,150.72

and Congruously hereunto I have found Pens Blackt almost all over, when I
had a while carri'd them about me in a Silver Ink-case.  To which I shall
only add, that whereas in these several Instances of Denigration, the
Metalls are worn off, or otherwise Reduc'd into very Minute Parts, that
Circumstance may prove not Unworthy your Notice.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,150.73

<heading>

EXPERIMENT X.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,150.75

<$$heading>

That a Solution of Silver does Dye Hair of a Black Colour, is a Known
Experiment, which some persons more Curious than Dextrous, have so
Unluckily made upon themselves as to make their Friends very Merry.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,150.77

And I remember that the other day, I made myself some Sport by an
Improvement of this Observation, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,150.78

for having dissolv'd some Pure Silver in <font> Aqua Fortis <$$font>
, and Evaporated the <font> Menstruum ad siccitatem <$$font>, as they
speak, I caus'd a Quantity of fair Water to be pour'd upon the <font>
Calx <$$font> two or three several times, and to be at each Evaporated
, till the <font> Calx <$$font> was very Drye, and all the Greenish
Blewness that is wont to appear in Common Crystals of Silver, <P_151>
was quite carry'd away.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,151.79

Then I made those I meant to Deceive, Moisten some part of their Skin with
their own Spittle, and slightly Rub the moistned parts with a little of
this Prepar'd Silver, Whereupon they Admir'd to see, that a Snow-white
Body laid upon the White Skin should presently produce a deep Blackness,
as if the stains had been made with Ink, especially considering that
this Blackness could not, like that produc'd by ordinary Ink, be readily
Wash'd off, but requir'd many Hours, and part of it some dayes, to its
Obliteration.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,151.80

And with the same White <font> Calx <$$font> and a little Fair Water
we likewise Stain'd the White Hafts of Knives, with a lasting Black in
those parts where the <font> Calx <$$font> was Plentifully enough laid
on, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,151.81

for where it was laid on but very Thinly, the Stain was not quite of so
Deep a Colour.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,151.82

<heading>

EXPERIMENT XI.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,151.84

<$$heading>

The Cause of the Blackness of those many Nations, which by one common Name
we are wont to call <font> Negroes <$$font>, has been long sence Disputed
of by Learned Men, who possibly had not done amiss, if they had also taken
into Consideration, why some whole races of other Animals besides Men,
as <P_152> Foxes and Hares, are Disinguish'd by a Blackness not familiar
to the Generality of Animals of the same Species ; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.86

The General Opinion <paren> to be mention'd a little lower has been
rejected even by some of the Antient Geographers, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.87

and among the Moderns <font> Ortelius <$$font> and divers other Men have
Question'd it.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.88

But this is no place to mention what thoughts I have had to and fro about
these Matters: Only as I shall freely Acknowledge, that to me the Enquiry
seems more Abstruse than it does to many others, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.89

and that because consulting with Authors, and with Books of Voyages,
and with Travellers, to satisfie my self in matters of Fact, I have
met with some things among them, which seem not to agree very well
with the Notions of the most Classick Authors concerning these things;
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.90

for it being my Present Work to deliver rather matters Historical than
Theorys, I shall Annex some few of my Collections, instead of a Solemn
Disputation.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.91

It is commonly presum'd that the Heat of the Climates wherein they live,
is the reason, why so many Inhabitants of the Scorching Regions of <font>
Africa <$$font> are Black; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,152.92

and there is this familiar Observation to Countenance this Conjecture,
That we plainly see that Mowers, Reapers, and other Country-people ,
<P_153> who spend the most part of the Hot Summer dayes expos'd to
the Sun, have the skin of their Hands and Faces, which are the parts
immediately Expos'd to the Sun and Air, made of a Darker Colour than
before, and consequently tending to Blackness; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,153.93

And Contrarywise we observe that the <font> Danes <$$font> and some other
people that Inhabit Cold Climates, and even the English who feel not
so Rigorous a Cold, have usually Whiter faces than the <font> Spaniards
<$$font>, <font> Portugalls <$$font> and other European Inhabitants of
Hotter Climates.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,153.94

But this Argument I take to be far more Specious than Convincing;
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,153.95

for though the Heat of the Sun may darken the Colour of the Skin, by
that Operation, which we in <font> English <$$font> call Sun-burning;
yet Experience doth not Evince, that I remember, That that Heat alone
can produce a Discolouring that shall amount to a true Blackness, like
that of <font> Negroes <$$font>, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,153.96

and we shall see by and by that even the Children of some <font> Negroes
<$$font> not yet 10. dayes Old <paren> perhaps not so much by
three quarters of that time <$$paren> will notwithstanding their Infancy
be of the same Hue with their Parents.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,153.97

Besides, there is this strong Argument to be alleg'd against the Vulgar
Opinion, that in divers places in Asia under the same Parallel, or even
of the same <P_154> Degree of Latitude with the African Regions Inhabited
by Blacks, the People are at most but Tawny; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,154.98

And in Africa it self divers Nations in the Empire of <font> Ethiopia
<$$font> are not <font> Negroes <$$font>, though Situated in the Torrid
Zone, and as neer the Aequinoctial, as other Nations that are so <paren>
as the Black Inhabitants of <font> Zeylan <$$font> and <font> Malabar
<$$font> are not in our Globes plac'd so near the Line as <font> Amara
<$$font> the Famousest place in <font> Ethiopia <$$font>.  <$$paren>
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,154.99

Moreover, <paren> that which is of no small Moment in our present
Disquisition <$$paren> I find not by the best Navigators and Travellers
to the <font> West-Indies <$$font>, whose Books or themselves I have
consulted on this Subject, that excepting perhaps one place or two
of small extent, there are any Blacks Originally Natives of any part
of <font> America <$$font> <paren> for the Blacks now there have been
by the <font> Europeans <$$font> long Transplanted thither <$$paren>
though the New World contain in it so great a Variety of Climates,
and particularly reach quite Cross the Torri'd Zone from one Tropick
to another.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,154.100

And though it be true that the <font> Danes <$$font> be a Whiter People
than the <font> Spaniards <$$font>, yet that may proceed rather from
other causes <paren> not here to be enquired into <$$paren> than from
the Coldness of the Climate, since not onely the <P_155> <font> Swedes
<$$font> and other Inhabitants of those Cold Countreys, are not usually
so White as the <font> Danes <$$font>, nor Whiter than other Nations in
proportion to their Vicinity to the Pole.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,155.101

<bracket> And since the Writing of the former part of this Essay, having
an opportunity on a Solemn occasion to take Notice of the Numerous Train
of some Extraordinary Embassadours sent from the <font> Russian <$$font>
Emperour to a great Monarch, observ'd, that <paren> though it were then
Winter <$$paren> the Colour of their Hair and Skin was far less Whitish
than the <font> Danes <$$font> who Inhabit a milder Region is wont to be,
but rather for the most part of a Darkish Brown; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,155.102

And the Physician to the Embassadour with whom those <font> Russes
<$$font> came, being ask'd by me whether in <font> Muscovy <$$font> it
self the Generality of the people were more inclin'd to have Dark-colour'd
Hair than {they_were_inclined_to_have} Flaxen, he answer'd Affirmatively
; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,155.103

but seem'd to suspect that the True and Antient <font> Russians <$$font>,
a Sept of whom he told me he had met with in one of the Provinces of
that vast Empire, were rather VVhite like the <font> Danes <$$font>,
than any thing near so Brown as the present <font> Muscovites <$$font>
whom he guesses to be descended of the <font> Tartars <$$font>, and to
have inherited their Colour from them.  <$$bracket> BOYLECOL-E3-P2,155.104

But to Prosecute our former Discourse, I shall add for further Proof
of the Conjecture I was <P_156> countenancing that good Authors inform
us that there are <font> Negroes <$$font> in <font> Africa <$$font>
not far from the <font> Cape of good Hope <$$font>, and consequently
beyond the Southern Tropick, and without the Torrid Zone, much about the
same Northern Latitude <paren> or very little more <$$paren> wherein
there are divers <font> American <$$font> Nations that are not <font>
Negroes <$$font>, and wherein the Inhabitants of <font> Candia <$$font>
, some parts of <font> Sicily <$$font>, and even of Spain are not so
much as Tawny-Mores.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,156.105

But <paren> which is a fresh and strong Argument against the common
Opinion, <$$paren> I find by our recent Relations of <font> Greenland
<$$font>, <paren> our Accounts whereof we owe to the Curiosity of
that Royal <font> Virtuoso <$$font> the present King of <font> Denmark
<$$font> , <$$paren> that the Inhabitants are Olive-colour'd, or rather
of a Darker Hiew.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,156.106

But if the Case were the same with Men, and those other kinds of
Animals I formerly nam'd, I should offer something as a considerable
proof, That, Cold may do much towards the making, Men White or Black ,
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,156.107

and however I shall set down the Observation as I have met with it
, as worthy to come into the History of Whiteness and Blackness,
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,156.108

and it is, that in some parts of <font> Russia <$$font> and of <font>
Livonia <$$font> it is affirm'd by <font> Olaus Magnus <$$font> and
others, that Hares and Foxes <paren> some add Partridges <$$paren> which
before were Black, or Red, or <P_157> Gray, do in the depth of Winter
become White by reason of the great Cold; <paren> for that it should be,
as some conceive, by Looking upon the Snow, seems improbable upon divers
accounts <$$paren> BOYLECOL-E3-P2,157.109

And I remember that having purposely enquir'd of a <font> Virtuoso
<$$font> who lately Travell'd through <font> Livonia <$$font> to <font>
Mosco <$$font>, concerning the Truth of this Tradition, he both told me
, he believ'd it, and added, that he saw divers of those lately nam'd
Animals either in <font> Russia <$$font> or <font> Livonia <$$font>
<paren> for I do not very well remember whether of the two <$$paren>
which, though White when he saw them in Winter, they assur'd him had
been Black, or of other Colours before the Winter began, and would be
so again when it was over.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,157.110

But for further satisfaction, I also consulted one that had for some
years been an Eminent Physician in <font> Russia <$$font>, who though
he rejected some other Traditions that are generally enough believ'd
concerning that Countrey, told me nevertheless, that he saw no cause to
doubt of this Tradition of <font> Olaus Magnus <$$font> as to Foxes and
Hares, not onely because $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} the common and uncontroul'd
Affection of the Natives, but also because he himself in the Winter
could never that he remember'd see Foxes and Hares of any other Colour
than White; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,157.111

And I my self having seen a small White <P_158> Fox, brought out of <font>
Russia <$$font> Into <font> England <$$font> towards the latter end of
Winter, foretold those that shew'd him me, that he would change Colour
in Summer, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.112

and accordingly coming to look upon him again in July, I found that the
Back and Sides, together with the upper part of the Head and Tayl were
already grown of a Dark Colour, the lower part of the Head and Belly
containing as yet a Whiteness.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.113

Let me add, that were it not for some scruple I have, I should think more
than what <font> Olaus <$$font> relates, confirm'd by the Judicious <font>
Olearius <$$font>, who was twice employ'd into those parts as a Publick
Minister, who in his Account of <font> Moscovy <$$font> has this Passage:
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.114

<font> The Hares there are Gray; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.115

but in some Provinces they grow white in the Winter.  <$$font>
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.116

And within some few Lines after: <font> It is not very Difficult to find
the Cause of this Change, which certainly proceeds only from the Outward
Cold, since I know that even in Summer, Hares will change colour, if
they be kept a competent time in a Cellar <$$font>; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.117

I say, were it not for some Scruple, because I take notice, that in
the same Page the Author Affirms, that the like change of Colour that
happens to Hares in some Provinces of <font> Muscovy <$$font>, happens
to them also in Livonia, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,158.118

and yet immediately subjoyns, that in <font> Curland <$$font> the Hares
vary not their Colour in Winter, <P_159> though these two last named
Countries be contiguous, <paren> that is <$$paren> sever'd only by the
River of Dugna; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,159.119

For it is scarce conceivable how Cold alone should have, in Countries
so near, so strangely differing an operation, though no less strange a
thing is confess'd by many, that ascribe the Complexion of <font> Negroes
<$$font> to the Heat of the Sun, when they would have the River of <font>
Cenega <$$font> so to bound the Moors, that though on the North-side they
are but Tawny, on the other side they are Black.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,159.120

There is another Opinion concerning the Complexion of <font> Negroes
<$$font>; that is not only embrac'd by many of the more Vulgar VVriters
, but likewise by that ingenious Traveller Mr. <font> Sandys
<$$font>, and by a late most learned Critick, besides other men of Note,
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,159.121

and these would have the Blackness of <font> Negroes <$$font> an effect
of <font> Noah's <$$font> Curse ratify'd by God's, upon <font> Cham
<$$font>; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,159.122

But though I think that even a Naturalist may with-out disparagement
believe all the Miracles attested by the Holy Scriptures, yet in this
case to flye to a Supernatural Cause, will, I fear, look like Shifting
off the Difficulty, instead of Resolving it; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,159.123

for we enquire not the First and Universal, but the Proper, Immediate ,
and Physical Cause of the Jetty Colour of <font> Negroes <$$font> ;
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,159.124

And not only we do not find expressed in the <P_160> Scripture, that
the Curse meant by <font> Noah <$$font> to <font> Cham <$$font>, was
the Blackness of his Posterity, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,160.125

but we do find plainly enough there that the Curse was quite another thing
, namely, that he should be a Servant of servants, that is by an Ebraism ,
a very Abject Servant to his Brethren, which accordingly did in part come
to pass, when the Israelites of the posterity of <font> Sem <$$font>
, subdued the <font> Canaanites <$$font>, that descended from <font>
Cham <$$font>, and kept them in great Subjection.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,160.126

Nor is it evident that Blackness is a Curse, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,160.127

for Navigators tell us of Black Nations, who think so much
otherwise of their own condition, that they paint the Devil White.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,160.128

Nor is Blackness inconsistent with Beauty, which even to our European
Eyes consists not so much in Colour, as an Advantageous Stature, a Comely
Symmetry of the parts of the Body, and Good Features in the Face.  So that
I see not why Blackness should be thought such a Curse to the <font>
Negroes <$$font>, unless perhaps it be, that being wont to go Naked in
those Hot Climates, the Colour of their Skin does probably, according
to the Doctrine above deliver'd, make the Sun-beams more Scorching
to them, than they would prove to a people of a VVhite Complexion.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,160.129

Greater probability there is, That the Principal Cause <paren> for I
would not exclude <P_161> all concurrent ones <$$paren> of the Blackness
of Negroes is some Peculiar and Seminal Impression, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,161.130

for not onely we see that <font> Black-more <$$font> boyes brought over
into these Colder Climates lose not their Colour; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,161.131

But good authors inform us, That the Off-spring of <font> Negroes <$$font>
Transplanted out of <font> Africa <$$font>, above a hundred years ago,
retain still the Complexion of their Progenitors, though possibly in
Tract of time it will decay; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,161.132

As on the other side, the White people removing into very Hot Climates
, have their Skins by the Heat of the Sun scorch'd into Dark Colours;
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,161.133

yet neither they, nor their Children have been observ'd, even in the
Countreys of Negroes; to descend to a Colour amounting to that of the
Natives; whereas I remember I have Read in <font> Pisos <$$font> excellent
account of <font> Brasile <$$font>, that betwixt the <font> Americans
<$$font> and <font> Negroes <$$font> are generated a distinct sort of Men,
which they call <font> Cabocles <$$font>, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,161.134

and betwixt <font> Portugalls <$$font> and <font> Aethiopian <$$font>
women, He tells us, he has sometimes seen Twins, whereof one had a White
skin, the other a Black; not to mention here some other instances ,
he gives, that the productions of the mixtures of differing people,
that is <paren> indeed, <$$paren> the effects of Seminal Impressions
which they consequently <P_162> argue to have been their Causes;
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,162.135

and we shall not much scruple at this, if we consider, that even Organical
parts may receive great Differences from such peculiar Impressions,
upon what account soever they came to be setled in the first Individual
persons, from whom they are Propagated to Posterity, as we see in the
Blobber-Lips and Flat-Noses of most Nations of <font> Negroes <$$font>.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,162.136

And if we may Credit what Learned men deliver concerning the Little Feet
of the <font> Chinesses <$$font>, the <font> Macrocephali <$$font> taken
notice of by <font> Hippocrates <$$font>, will not be the only Instance
we might apply to our present purpose.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,162.137

And on this occasion it will not perchance be Impertinent to add something
of what I have observ'd in other Animals, as that there is a sort of
Hens that want Rumps; And that <paren> not to mention that in several
places there is a sort of Crows or Daws that are not Cole-black as ours,
but Partly of a Whitish Colour <$$paren> in spight of <font> Porphyries
<$$font> examples of Inseparable Accidents, I have seen a perfectly White
Raven, as to Bill as well as Feathers, which I attentively consider'd,
for fear of being impos'd upon.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,162.138

And this recalls into my Memory, what a very Ingenious Physician has
divers times related to me of a young Lady, to whom being call'd, he
found that though <P_163> she much complain'd of want of Health, yet
there appear'd so little cause either in her Body, or her Condition to
Guess that She did any more than fancy her self Sick, that scrupling
to give her Physick, he perswaded her friends rather to divert her
Mind by little journeys of Pleasure, in one of which going to Visit
St. <font> Winifrids <$$font> Well, this Lady, who was a <font>
Catholick <$$font>, and devout in her Religion, and a pretty while in
the VVater to perform some Devotions, $had {TEXT:and_had} occasion to
fix her Eyes very attentively upon the Red pipple-stones, which in a
scatter'd order made up a good part of those that appear'd through the
water, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,163.139

and awhile after growing Bigg, she was deliver'd of a Child, whose
VVhite Skin was Copiously speckl'd with spots of the Colour and Bigness
of those Stones; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,163.140

and though now this Child have already liv'd several years, yet she
still retains them.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,163.141

I have but two things to add concerning the Blackness of <font> Negroes
<$$font>, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,163.142

the one is, that the Seat of that Colour seems to be but the thin <font>
Epidermes <$$font>, or outward Skin, BOYLECOL-E3-P2,163.143

for I knew a young <font> Negroe <$$font>, who having been lightly
Sick of the Small pox or Measles, <paren> for it was doubted which of
the two was his Disease <$$paren> I found by enquiry of a person that
vvas concern'd for him, that in those places the little Tumors <P_164>
$had {TEXT:that_had} broke their passage through the Skin, when they
were gone, they left VVhitish specks behind them; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,164.144

And the lately commended <font> Piso <$$font> assures us, that having
the opportunity in <font> Brasil <$$font> to Dissect many <font> Negroes
<$$font>, he cleerly found that their Blackness went no deeper then the
very outward Skin, which <font> Cuticula <$$font> or <font> Epiderms
<$$font> being remov'd, the undermost Skin or <font> Cutis <$$font>
appear'd just as VVhite as that of <font> European <$$font> Bodyes.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,164.145

And the like has been affirmed to me by a Physician of our own, whom
hearing he had Dissected a <font> Negroe <$$font> here in <font> England
<$$font>, I consulted about this particular.  BOYLECOL-E3-P2,164.146

The other thing to be here taken notice of concerning <font> Negroes
<$$font> is, That having enquir'd of an Intelligent acquaintance of mine
<paren> who keeps in the <font> Indies <$$font> about 200. of
them as well VVomen as Men to work in his Plantations, <$$paren> whether
their Children come Black into the world; he answer'd, That they did not,
but were brought forth of almost the like Reddish Colour with our <font>
European <$$font> Children; BOYLECOL-E3-P2,164.147

and having further enquir'd, how long it was before these Infants appear'd
Black, he reply'd, that $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} not wont to be many daies.
BOYLECOL-E3-P2,164.148
