Abowt noon the wynd blew up boysterowsly at sowthwest with rayn and slyt

MADOX-E2-P2,115.2

M. Walker was hear very gallant in a velvet hat.  MADOX-E2-P2,115.3

I was told that he had preched on Sunday in Hampton MADOX-E2-P2,115.4

and he told me that I was register of the viage and that my Lord of
Leycester had spoken wel of mee and M. secretary Walsingham great
good who indeed doth not knoe me.  MADOX-E2-P2,115.5

Nether can I tel wher he shold lern any thing of me otherwyse than by
the report of M. Mylls or M. Carleyl, wherof nether the
one hath had tyme nor the other conversation with me to knoe me in deed
, MADOX-E2-P2,115.6

but M. Carleils good nature hath conceved better of me than I
can think of my self.  MADOX-E2-P2,115.7

I pray God grant me his grace and favowr that the effect and yssue of
my lyfe may be somwhat answerable to the expectation of thes good noble
men and gentilmen, MADOX-E2-P2,115.8

for as the God of heaven whom I serve and wil do for ever hath kyndled in
ther harts a certayn hope of me withowt my desert so I trust his bownty
wil bestoe upon mee his spetial blessyngs that I be not altogether left
unto my self or to my own wyt and so overthroe all, MADOX-E2-P2,115.9

but I trust that the Lord who hath kept me from my youth up will keep
me to the end.  MADOX-E2-P2,115.10

M. Banester who because he hath not scholership to do anything

something cast overburd a curious payr of bedes of myne which M=rs=
Lucar gave me to exchange at the Yndyes because he wold appear very
zealows, MADOX-E2-P2,119.96

for in matters of lerning a man may be tryed and fownd before men when he
vawnteth as I have hytherto sufred hym above measure, MADOX-E2-P2,119.97

but in matters of religion only God can se the hart MADOX-E2-P2,119.98

and therfore some men ar therin over ernest many tymes more for desyre
of foolysh speche than otherwyse so that I am abashed to se how he
overweeneth hym self in comparison of Lewys Otmore who is both for <P_120>

and fownd them to be more than 200 which was our proportion
MADOX-E2-P2,120.106

but because the Elsabeth was bowght for burden sake and the frigot sold
for 40=li= to Sir Humphrey Gilbert therfor for hir supply and that we wer
by M. Haukins enformed we shold hav vitayl ynogh at the Yndyes,
we tooke in abowt 30 more, MADOX-E2-P2,120.107

but yet this I marked by the slynking away of some knaves after ther

not amysse to hyre men by the week or moneth to ryg a ship, not letting
them wyt whether, and when al is redy than to put men in wages for the

Yt rose on the sowthwest of us with 3 hils in the land, the myddest lyk
Glastenbury Tor.  MADOX-E2-P2,147.182

Capten Parker and Luk Ward after we had anchored in the bay went to
descrye the land, MADOX-E2-P2,147.183

but because the rut {COM:surge} went somwhat hard a shore, therfore they
wold not bryng the boat a shore MADOX-E2-P2,147.184

and capten Parker lyke a bold soldier thowght every crib {COM:hovel}

Luke Ward sent owt 2 which swyming to land discried a fayr river,
a number of gotes, plenty of byrds but no people, MADOX-E2-P2,147.186

and ther was also abundance of fysh and monstruows great tortuses.
MADOX-E2-P2,147.187

Luk Ward took one as byg as a child of the largest fyshe which wold have
broken a boat thole {COM:oarlock} in his mowth.  MADOX-E2-P2,147.188

Hear be also great shorks which is as yt wer an overgroen dogfysh of 6

In fyne when we returned, the general wold not consent to water hear

of the greatest cumforts in the world do now deny al and say that we

I pray God blesse me from such pilates.  MADOX-E2-P2,148.194

MADOX-E2-P2,148.199

and so upon $Thurs. Luk Ward cam to us to excuse hym self abowt
vitayling the bark MADOX-E2-P2,148.200

Al this week we made many boords, some east, some west.
MADOX-E2-P2,151.272

We had the wynd at sowth and much rayn MADOX-E2-P2,151.273

but the wether as our Englysh Autume save that the ayr was more thick
and foggy MADOX-E2-P2,151.274

and we saw now and than lyke purple bladders swym on the sea which our men
cawled carvels, tellyng us that they wold sting sore.  MADOX-E2-P2,151.275

When I appoynted the boys that wayted to repeat ech meal a sentence owt

shold lern any such thing MADOX-E2-P2,151.276

for he browght hym not hyther for that purpose, MADOX-E2-P2,151.277

and as for hym self he wil not geve a fart for al ther cosmography
MADOX-E2-P2,151.278

for he can tel more than al the cosmographers in the world
MADOX-E2-P2,151.279

M. Banester sayth that he healed 200 in one yer of an ague by
hanging abracadabra abowt ther necks and wold stanch blood or heal the

told hym at Rochester that he wold the mownsewr wer hanged, and that
the queen sayd, I thank you, good M. Banester, MADOX-E2-P2,151.283

and yf I be able I wil requyte you MADOX-E2-P2,151.284

and so she gave hym the advowsons of 2 benefyces which wer sent to hym
by doctor Julio MADOX-E2-P2,151.285

but the doctor sold them both by the way so <P_152> that M.
Banester had nothing MADOX-E2-P2,152.286

but yet M. Stanhop offered hym synce C=li= for his interest in

yet he wold not take yt.  MADOX-E2-P2,152.288

Having byn hytherto very yll and unable to brook any meat, Symon Wood
gave me 3 drops of artificial oyl for 3 mornings which he bowght of
M. Buntford, a goldfyner at the Mayden Head in Aldersgate street,
which dryed up my rewme and did me much good MADOX-E2-P2,152.289

and surely yt is a very excelant balme MADOX-E2-P2,152.290

and cost a noble an ownce.  MADOX-E2-P2,152.291

The general told of one that was lyke a pye, a fly, and a fart:
MADOX-E2-P2,152.292

a pye for he wold have al the talk, MADOX-E2-P2,152.293

a fly for he wold be ever in the dysh, MADOX-E2-P2,152.294

a fart for he wold depart from his norysher with a fowld word and never
return to his cuntrey to geve yt thanks.  MADOX-E2-P2,152.295

15. {COM:Sun.} <font> 5 after Trinity <$$font> MADOX-E2-P2,152.296

the wynd somwhat larged toward the sowthwest so that we kept very nye
sowtheast being now between 7 and 8 degrees to the north and abowt 100
leags fro the cost of Affryck as was thowght MADOX-E2-P2,152.297

but after yt proved lesse MADOX-E2-P2,152.298

for on {COM:19} Thursday we had lytle barnacles which did eat lyk
cravisshes {COM:crayfishes} gathered of our boat MADOX-E2-P2,152.299

and on Fryday M. Hood took a dolphin which was indeed a fyne whyt
meat and sweet but yet not lyke to the samon.  MADOX-E2-P2,152.300

Being as we suppozed within 5 degrees of the lyne or lesse we descryed
a hygh land abowt 9 leags of at east northeast which we deemed to be
Capo de Palmas or Capo de Verga so that Luk Ward with his master and
pilat seeing us cast offward cam aboord and wyshed that in as much as
we did ly bwelting at the sea and cold doe noe good wee shold stand in
with some harboroe for the releif of our cumpanyes.  MADOX-E2-P2,152.301

Than was the cowncel cawled to <P_153> se wher we wer MADOX-E2-P2,153.302

and now every mans reconyng was behind the ships way above 50 leags wherby
I did perceav that ether they had not geven yt alowance to leeward as
the ships lyst required or els ther ran some current which set us to
the eastward under the wether bow MADOX-E2-P2,153.303

and so I think yt trew MADOX-E2-P2,153.304

for at nyght we wer in a very rugh race {COM:current} at 65 fadom of
soft sandy oze lyke bran and brayd {COM:beaten} pepper, which I judged
to be St. Annes Shole.  MADOX-E2-P2,153.305

Wel when the viceadmiral was come aboord with his master and Blackoller ,
our general, which had cast to the offard west northwest, at the motion
of the viceadmiral and others that desyred rather to go on shore for
the refreshing of our men than to lye bwelting on the sea and do no
good for some of us wer dead and many syck cauled the matter in cowncel
MADOX-E2-P2,153.306

and proposed the question wher we wer, shewing his own accownt and others.
MADOX-E2-P2,153.307

M. Whood sayd the land we saw was Capo de Palmas or els hee wold
fyrst be hanged and after cut in 1000 peeces.  MADOX-E2-P2,153.308

Such an insolent spech men wold not for modesty sack crose, althogh ther
wer reasons to the contrary.  MADOX-E2-P2,153.309

Than was demanded whether {were} better go forward to the east or go
back agayn to the norwest.  MADOX-E2-P2,153.310

M. Haukins with good probable reasons shewd that the further
we passed eastward the further wer we fro the river of Plate
MADOX-E2-P2,153.311

and better therfore to passe to the Surliona MADOX-E2-P2,153.312

for yf we wer ether caulmed or fownd the wynd in any part of the sowth
we myght harbor ther with great safety, MADOX-E2-P2,153.313

but yf northerly we myght put of to our great advauntedge.
MADOX-E2-P2,153.314

M. Whood sayd that was a villanows coast MADOX-E2-P2,153.315

for when Sir Frances Drake did ther water they set one the potage pot
with ryce every meale.  MADOX-E2-P2,153.316

The general was loth to go thither pretending that he feared the health
of his men because al had spoke yl of the cuntrey, MADOX-E2-P2,153.317

but the very truth was, he feared lest fynding ther suffyciency for
our provision he shold have than no pretence to passe to the westward
notwithstanding M. Hawkins objecting that {the} further we went
eastward the further we wer from our mark and in more danger to be <P_154>
calmed, MADOX-E2-P2,154.318

he yelded to go back to Sera Leona except the wynd served.
MADOX-E2-P2,154.319

Capten Ward as I perceived undertaking this viage as wel for the hope
of his experience as of his profyt and rather more was desyrows to se
the shore MADOX-E2-P2,154.320

and on this agreement we departed MADOX-E2-P2,154.321

but presently after the wynd comyng agayn to the sowthwest which was
before dew sowth we browght the starboord tack aboord MADOX-E2-P2,154.322

and bore agayn sowthsotheast with dyvers scuds of rayn.
MADOX-E2-P2,154.323

21. {COM:Sat.} MADOX-E2-P2,154.324

abowt noone the wynd agayn began to meet at sowthwest so that we ran
agayn westnorwest and spied land agayn MADOX-E2-P2,154.325

and on $Sun. <font> 6 after Trinity <$$font> being abowt agayn
we had land one ech syde to leeward MADOX-E2-P2,154.326

and fownd our selvs so puzzeled that no man cold say wher we wer, not
having seen sune or stars for 14 days, MADOX-E2-P2,154.327

but of truth we were not so far to the sowthward by 3 degrees at the
least toward the sowth MADOX-E2-P2,154.328

and therfor whether the current set to the nornorest by the reset and
yeynwal of Brazil or whether the streames of Rio Grande or other rivers
that fawl myghtyly into the sea cause some current or whether yt always
do foloe the wynd, sure I am we wer no nyer than 8 degrees to the lyne
MADOX-E2-P2,154.329

and I think further of MADOX-E2-P2,154.330

and now agayn we cast to the offward to west norwest.  MADOX-E2-P2,154.331

23. {COM:Mon.} MADOX-E2-P2,154.332

the master went into the boat MADOX-E2-P2,154.333

and grapeled at 300 fadom MADOX-E2-P2,154.334

and sayd that the current did set ful eastwards MADOX-E2-P2,154.335

but indeede the wynd was so byg that I knoe not how he shold wel judge.
MADOX-E2-P2,154.336

Hear we met with a number of things cauled blubbers lyke unto red bryer
bawles a handful stil under the water.  MADOX-E2-P2,154.337

24 {COM:Tues.} MADOX-E2-P2,154.338

in the morning I drempt of many strange visions that being in Grampole
in Oxford I dyd se in the ayr, espetialy an old man as yt were the pope
with a sword in his hand and a great rank with hym runyng violently
agaynst the steeple.  MADOX-E2-P2,154.339

At the later end of dynner as we wended westsowest with the larboord
tack aboord and a bold wynd, the mayn topmast was bloen down even as
the general was drynking MADOX-E2-P2,155.341

and fawling to leeward dyd tear the mayn top much MADOX-E2-P2,155.342

and hanged by the puttocks {COM:shrouds} yt brak 7 foot from the root
wher before yt had byn fysht so that on {COM:25.} $Wed. beyng
St. James day we had fayre wether and set up the top agayn beyng

and {COM:26._Thurs.} we set up the topmast, beyng so much shorter than
before yt had been.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.344

I went aboord the Edward with M. Hawkins wher we had a dolphin.
MADOX-E2-P2,155.345

Many of them wer syck MADOX-E2-P2,155.346

and did complayn the want of fresh water so that I brynging a letter from
M. Walker to the general that 30 were syck, he tooke yt yl and
dyd deem yt had byn some practyce of the viceadmiral.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.347

the general went aboord the Edward.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.353

I wrot by M. Banester to M. Lewes that they 2 shold one
make muche of an other, desyring rather to reape prayses of others than
to attribute unto them selvs anything.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.354

I wrot also to M. Walker upon the occasion of his letter.
MADOX-E2-P2,155.355

I think thus verbatim MADOX-E2-P2,155.356

Your unpleasant letter distressed me very much.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.357

It makes unjust demands; MADOX-E2-P2,155.358

it mentions disagreeable things; MADOX-E2-P2,155.359

it makes unfair objections; MADOX-E2-P2,155.360

it complains without reason.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.361

With love to both of you.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.366

R. M. Jeffrey said that some were muttering that I wish
to play the part of M. Fletcher.  MADOX-E2-P2,155.367

Please find out who spread <P_156> this rumor and what they expect to
gain from it, MADOX-E2-P2,156.368

for I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} quite follow.  MADOX-E2-P2,156.369

Thes letters and others the general did open as I suppoze by the
provoquement of M. Banester in whose head ther is some gelosy,
MADOX-E2-P2,156.370

for wel assured I am that ther hath not passed me anything wherby
the general hym self shold hold me in any suspicion, whoze credyt
I have hytherto every way sowght both at land and sea to uphold.
MADOX-E2-P2,156.371

What M. Cotton had wrytten I knoe not MADOX-E2-P2,156.372

but tuching the lyke case ther wer sad words betwyxt hym and the general.
MADOX-E2-P2,156.373

I pray God setle his love among us MADOX-E2-P2,156.374

els he that seeketh revenge may quycly ether upon pryvy and false

After clowdy wether in maner al this moneth and coole wyndes, now yt

abowt easterly being between 3 and 4 degrees fro the lyne on the north.
MADOX-E2-P2,156.377

M. Evans told me that the hygher the ryver runeth the deeper the
tyde ebbeth and floeth MADOX-E2-P2,156.378

and therfor he thinketh that by meanes of the great indrawghts the
current in ech place setteth toward the shore and in the mydlest of the

Hearof lern more of the northeast and northwest and mydleyerth travelers.
MADOX-E2-P2,156.380

Before nyght yet agayn we browght agayn the larboord tack aboord
MADOX-E2-P2,156.381

and set to the west.  MADOX-E2-P2,156.382

Capten Skevington supt with us MADOX-E2-P2,156.383

and on the sodayn was a great cry on the Elsabeth MADOX-E2-P2,156.384

and yt was told that one was leapt overboord.  MADOX-E2-P2,156.385

30. {COM:Mon.} MADOX-E2-P2,156.386

the general went thither to examyn the matter MADOX-E2-P2,156.387

and had me with hym to geve them exhortacions.  MADOX-E2-P2,156.388

Capten <P_157> Skevington by the way complayned to me grevowsly that
M. Wylks wold fart before hym etc. MADOX-E2-P2,157.389

When we cam thither we fownd that Julian Saunders, a foolysh feloe,
had fowght with the masters mate and after leapt overboord because they
wold not suffer $hym to come unto us.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.390

Yt was determined that he shold be hoysed to the yerd arme and so
let fawl.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.391

M. Hawl sayd the yerd wold break.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.392

Wel hoysed he was MADOX-E2-P2,157.393

and in the swyng the yerd snapt quyt of in the myddle MADOX-E2-P2,157.394

and al cam into the sea not withstanding after he cam yn agayn upon his
submission he was pardoned.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.395

We went to the Fraunses to dynner wher we had of porpase and dolphyn
dyvers ways drest a very fyne and ful dynner, MADOX-E2-P2,157.396

and some we browght home, MADOX-E2-P2,157.397

and of the tayl that is as lyke black lether as is possible which was
cut of to throe away we made a meat that none cold have knoen yt from
baked calvs feet.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.398

M. Taylboise, being a lytle overgone as oft he is, fownd muche
falt with this punyshment of the man.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.399

The general overhearing cawled hym.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.400

What taulk they had I kno not, MADOX-E2-P2,157.401

but M. Cotton was bydden geve place to the commissioners,
MADOX-E2-P2,157.402

so was M. Banester.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.403

Whether of them tooke the matter worse I knoe not MADOX-E2-P2,157.404

for yt stung them both to the hart, MADOX-E2-P2,157.405

but M. Cotton somwhat and not much better dissembled yt,
complayning greatly that the general had his letter and he cold not get
yt, MADOX-E2-P2,157.406

so Banester sate beloe MADOX-E2-P2,157.407

and M. Cotton cam not to supper.  MADOX-E2-P2,157.408

31. {COM:Tues.} MADOX-E2-P2,157.409

ther was hard reasoning betwyxt the general and M. Cotton.
MADOX-E2-P2,157.410

What was the effect I kno not, MADOX-E2-P2,157.411

but now is he set at the boords end by the general with great honor.
MADOX-E2-P2,157.412

He told me yt was by reason of a letter from my Lord Lumley.
MADOX-E2-P2,157.413

Now is M. Banester in worst taking MADOX-E2-P2,157.414

and sayth he shal dye and he can not leave syghing and many foolysh and
intemprat words why God shold thus abase hym and for which his synnes.
MADOX-E2-P2,157.415

I was with hym MADOX-E2-P2,157.416

and althoe he forge fasting, yet he hath plenty of coole bear and
aquavite MADOX-E2-P2,157.417

and I fownd chese parings and bacon stoored in his wyndoe.

1. {COM:Wed.} <font> Lammas day.  <$$font> MADOX-E2-P2,158.423

M. Banester took on so heavyly that the merchants lest he shold
fawl into desperation wer desyrows agayn to prefer hym MADOX-E2-P2,158.424

and al was but the shiftyng of one peg, so that now he is content,
saving that he muche repineth at my Lord of Lester that he was not made
of the cownsel.  MADOX-E2-P2,158.425

After dynner I knoe not upon what motion in the world, the general fyrst
ymparting his mynde to us and than with owr lykyng cawled a cowncel
wherunto when al were come, he proponed that syth our bear spent faster
than our way, whether yt were not good to go seeke water and yf to seek
yt than wher?  MADOX-E2-P2,158.426

With general consent of al save my self yt was concluded yea and the
Surleona appoynted so that at night being from yt as I deem abowt
100 leags we set our cowrse northeast with quarter wynd towards yt in
Gods name.  MADOX-E2-P2,158.427

M. Walker told mee that wher in my former Laten intercepted letter
I had wrytten <font> domini fletcheri <$$font>, yt was construed that
I thowght I was used lyke a fletcher wherat I laffed, MADOX-E2-P2,158.428

etc. MADOX-E2-P2,158.429

Ned Gylman took an alcatrash on the mayntopmast yerd, which is a foolysh
byrd but good lean rank meat.  MADOX-E2-P2,158.430

2. {COM:Thurs.} MADOX-E2-P2,158.431

Edward Stokes of Henbury or Amsbury, the plat drawer, dyed of a calentowr.
MADOX-E2-P2,158.433

God be mercyful to us that lyve.  MADOX-E2-P2,158.434

He is the fyfth whom we have throen overboord, MADOX-E2-P2,158.435

and before morning died David Evans of Gloester, baker, of an old <P_159>
bruse.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.436

This cuntrey is very temperat MADOX-E2-P2,159.437

or els sendeth them to a better physicion.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.440

3. {COM:Fri.} MADOX-E2-P2,159.441

at supper we espied a ripling of the water as we trended eastnortheast
MADOX-E2-P2,159.442

and anan on the lyebord we saw a very hyghland which M. Haukins
prononced absolutely to be Serra Liona, that is to say the mowntayn of
lyons, MADOX-E2-P2,159.443

but he was flatly withstood by Pilote and Herode, MADOX-E2-P2,159.444

and M. Parker sayd he wold reason with the best mariner in Ingland
and prove yt cold not be yt, because the Serraliona lay in 8 and a terce
but we wer now in 6 and a terce, notwithstanding he did not perceave
the current which setteth ful northeast, MADOX-E2-P2,159.445

for we ar fawln as far this way in 2 days as we ran the other way in
5 days.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.446

Great hold {COM:contention} and hye wordes ther were.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.447

I think we saw yt abowt to ken of.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.448

The sownding was black hose {COM:ooze}, the land very hye

and in this wyse yt appeared.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.452

{COM:fig._8._capo_de_monte_sketch_32v}

I forgat to tel of a great bonetto which capten Hawkyns took with an
hook on Fryday.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.454

Yt was 4 foot and a half long and almost as thick, just lyke a mackrel
but more trinchioned.  MADOX-E2-P2,159.455

The head did eat as sweet as any calvs head, MADOX-E2-P2,159.456

and Fry kyld a dolphyn which had in his poych {COM:pouch} a flying fysh
of a foot long with 4 wyngs, MADOX-E2-P2,159.457

and how M. Banester told me he wold have that Cotton, as he cawled
hym, by the eares MADOX-E2-P2,159.458

now yf he myght have leave; MADOX-E2-P2,159.459

yf not, yet at his return to Yngland, which being sent to sea because
he durst not shew his face in London for det and <P_160> had been hyd at
M. Onleys wold now cal hym arrogant physician.  MADOX-E2-P2,160.460

See the humor of a foolysh man MADOX-E2-P2,160.461

but now to the purpose.  MADOX-E2-P2,160.462

Abowt noone the master went yn the pynnyse MADOX-E2-P2,160.463

and fownd fyrst 30 fadom oze in sownding MADOX-E2-P2,160.464

MADOX-E2-P2,160.466

They fownd a canow and 3 or 4 lytle howses made of reeds lyke unto greate
drye seges MADOX-E2-P2,160.468

They gathered oliphants dung MADOX-E2-P2,160.470

and espied a fayr ynlet of water and a goodly fresh spryng fast by the
shore, MADOX-E2-P2,160.471

but comyng back they had but cold thanks, MADOX-E2-P2,160.472

for nether dare some men ventur them selvs MADOX-E2-P2,160.473

nor can not abyde that other shal be thowght able to do more than they.
MADOX-E2-P2,160.474

Wel now because we cold not se a rock at the norwest end, this was not
{COM:Serra_Leona}, althogh al our pylots 2 howrs before sayd, who knoes
not this to be the same?  MADOX-E2-P2,160.475

I was desyrows to have anchored hear and march to the hil top
MADOX-E2-P2,160.476

for the wether was fayr and trusty ryding in the bay MADOX-E2-P2,160.477

but no help, MADOX-E2-P2,160.478

hall of agayn to the sea and try further, which is to refuse Gods blessing
prafered by the fyre syde on a cold day and to tread up and down in the
snoe to seeke a warme suny bank.  MADOX-E2-P2,160.479
