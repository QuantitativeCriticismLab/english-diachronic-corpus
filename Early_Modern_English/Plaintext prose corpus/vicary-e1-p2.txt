<P_42>

The partes of the mouth are fyue, that is to say, the Lippes, the teeth ,
the toung, the Uuila, and the Pallet of the mouth.  VICARY-E1-P2,42.2

And first to speake of the lippes: they are members consimile or official
, full of Musculus fleshe, as is aforesayde, VICARY-E1-P2,42.3

and they were ordeyned for two causes; VICARY-E1-P2,42.4

one is, that they should be to the mouth as a doore to a house, and to
keepe the mouth close tyl the meate were kindly chewed: VICARY-E1-P2,42.5

The other cause is, that they should be helpers to the pronouncing of
the speache.  VICARY-E1-P2,42.6

The teeth are members consimile or official, spermatike, and hardest of
any other members, VICARY-E1-P2,42.7

and are fastened in the cheke bones, VICARY-E1-P2,42.8

and were ordeyned for three causes: VICARY-E1-P2,42.9

First, that they should chewe a mans meate, or it should passe downe,
that it might be the sooner digested: VICARY-E1-P2,42.10

The seconde, that they should be a helpe to the speache;
VICARY-E1-P2,42.11

for they that lacke their Teeth, doe not perfectly pronounce their wordes:
VICARY-E1-P2,42.12

the thirde is, that they should serue to beasts as weapons.
VICARY-E1-P2,42.13

The number of them is vncertayne; VICARY-E1-P2,42.14

for some men haue mo, and some lesse; VICARY-E1-P2,42.15

they that haue the whole number haue.xxxij. , that is to say.xvj.  <P_43>
aboue, and as many beneath, as thus, two <font> Duvallies <$$font>,
two <font> Quadripulles <$$font>, two <font> Cannines <$$font>, eyght
<font> Morales {COM:sic} <$$font>, and two <font> Cansales <$$font>.
VICARY-E1-P2,43.16

The Toung is a carnous member, compounde and made of many Nerues,
Lygamentes, Veines and Arteirs, ordeyned principally for three causes :
VICARY-E1-P2,43.17

The first is, that when a man eateth, the Toung mighte helpe to turne
the meate tyll it were wel chewed: VICARY-E1-P2,43.18

The seconde cause is, that by him is receiued the taste of sweete and
sowre, and presented by him to the common wittes: VICARY-E1-P2,43.19

The thirde is, that by him is pronounced euery speach.  VICARY-E1-P2,43.20

The fleshly parte of the toung is white, VICARY-E1-P2,43.21

and hath in him nine muskles; VICARY-E1-P2,43.22

and about the roote of him is Glandulus, in the whiche be two welles,
VICARY-E1-P2,43.23

and they be euer ful of spittle, to temper and keepe moyst the toung,
VICARY-E1-P2,43.24

or els it would waxe dry by reason of his labour, &c.  VICARY-E1-P2,43.25

The Uuila is a member made of a spongeous fleshe, hanging downe from
the ende of the Pallet ouer the goulet of the throte, VICARY-E1-P2,43.26

and is a member in complexion colde and dry; VICARY-E1-P2,43.27

and oftentimes when there falleth rawnes or muche moystnes into it from
the head, then it hangeth downe in the throte, VICARY-E1-P2,43.28

and letteth a man to swallowe; VICARY-E1-P2,43.29

and it is broade at the vpper ende, and smal at the nether.
VICARY-E1-P2,43.30

It was ordeyned for diuers causes: VICARY-E1-P2,43.31

One is, that by him is holpen the sounde of speache; VICARY-E1-P2,43.32

for where the Uuila is lacking, there lacketh the perfect sound of
speache: VICARY-E1-P2,43.33

Another is, that it might helpe the prolation of vomites:
VICARY-E1-P2,43.34

another is, that by him is tempered and abated the distemperaunce of
the ayre that passeth to the Lunges: VICARY-E1-P2,43.35

another is, that by <P_44> him is guyded the superfluities of the brayne
that commeth from the coletures of the Nose; VICARY-E1-P2,44.36

or els the superfluities should fal down sodenly into the mouth, the
which were a displeasure.  VICARY-E1-P2,44.37

The Pallet of the mouth conteyneth nothing els but a carnous Pannikle;
VICARY-E1-P2,44.38

and the bones that be vnderneath it haue two diuisions, One along the
Pallet from the diuision of the Nose, and from the opening of the other
Mandible vnto the nether ende of the Pallet, lacking halfe an inch;
VICARY-E1-P2,44.39

and there it diuideth ouerthwart; VICARY-E1-P2,44.40

and the first diuision is of the Mandible, VICARY-E1-P2,44.41

and the seconde is of the bone called Paxillarie or Bazillarie,
that sustayneth and byndeth al other bones of the head together.
VICARY-E1-P2,44.42

The skinne of the Pallet of the mouth is of the inner parte of the
stomack and of Myre, and of Ysofagus, that is, the way of the meate into
the stomacke.  VICARY-E1-P2,44.43

The way how to know that such a pannicle is of that part of the stomacke
, may be knowen when that a man is touched within the mouth, anone he
beginneth to tickle in the stomacke; VICARY-E1-P2,44.44

and the neere that he shal touche vnto the throte, the more it abhorreth
the stomacke, VICARY-E1-P2,44.45

and often times it causeth the stomacke to yeld from him that is within
him, as when a man doth vomite.  VICARY-E1-P2,44.46

Also in the mouth is ended the vppermoste extremitie of the Wesande,
which is called Myre or Isofagus.  VICARY-E1-P2,44.47

And with hym is conteyned <font> Trachia arteria <$$font>, that is,
the way of the ayre, whose holes be couered with a lap like a tong,
VICARY-E1-P2,44.48

and is gristly, that the meate and drinke mighte slyde ouer him into
Isofagus: The <P_45> whiche grystle, when a man speaketh, it is reared vp,
and couereth the way of the meate: and when a man swalloweth the meate,
then it couereth the way of the ayre, so that when the one is couered,
the other is discouered.  VICARY-E1-P2,45.49

For if a man open the way of the ayre when he swalloweth, if there fal
a crum into it, he shal neuer cease coughing vntil it be vp agayne.
VICARY-E1-P2,45.50

And this suffiseth for the necke.  VICARY-E1-P2,45.51

<heading:edcomment:CHAPTER_VI>

<heading>

<font> Heereafter foloweth the <$$font> Anatomie of the Necke.
VICARY-E1-P2,45.54

<$$heading>

The Necke foloweth next to be spoken of.  VICARY-E1-P2,45.56

Galen proueth that the Necke was made for no other cause but for the
Lunges; VICARY-E1-P2,45.57

for al thinges that haue no Lungs, haue neither necke nor voyce,
except fishe.  VICARY-E1-P2,45.58

And you shal vnderstande, that the necke is all that is conteyned betweene
the head and the shoulders, and betweene the chinne and the brest.
VICARY-E1-P2,45.59

It is compounde and made of foure thinges, that is to say, of <font>
Spondillus <$$font>, or <font> Seruicibus <$$font>, or <font> Gula
<$$font>, and of <font> Gutture <$$font>, the which shal be declared
more playnely hereafter; VICARY-E1-P2,45.60

and through these, passe the waye of the meate and of the ayre;
VICARY-E1-P2,45.61

but they be not of the substance of the necke.  VICARY-E1-P2,45.62

The Spondelles of the necke be seuen: VICARY-E1-P2,45.63

The fyrst is ioyned vnto the lower parte of the head, called Paxillarie
or Bazillarie, VICARY-E1-P2,45.64

and in the same wise are ioyned euery Spondel with other, and the laste
of the seuen with the fyrst of the Backe or Ridge: VICARY-E1-P2,45.65

and the Lygamentes that keepe these Spondels together, are not so hard
and tough as those of the backe: VICARY-E1-P2,45.66

for why?  VICARY-E1-P2,45.67

those of the necke be more feebler and subtiller: VICARY-E1-P2,45.68

The cause <P_46> is this, VICARY-E1-P2,46.69

for it is necessary otherwhile that the head moue without the necke,
and the necke without the head, the whiche might not well haue beene
done if they had beene strong and boystrous.  VICARY-E1-P2,46.70

Of these aforesayd seuen Spondels of the necke, there springeth seuen
payre of Senewes, the whiche be diuided into the head and into the Vysage,
to the shoulders, and to the armes.  VICARY-E1-P2,46.71

From the hole of the first spondel springeth the fyrst payre of senewes,
betwene the fyrst spondel and the seconde; VICARY-E1-P2,46.72

and so foorth of al the rest in like maner as of these.
VICARY-E1-P2,46.73

Also these senewes receyue subtil wylle of the senewes of the Brayne;
of the which wylle, and senewes, and fleshe, with a pannikle, make the
composition of Muskels, Lazartes, and Brawnes, the which three thinges
be al one, and be the instrumentes of voluntarie mouing of euery member.
VICARY-E1-P2,46.74

The Muskles of the neck, after Galen, are numbred to be.xx.  mouing the
head and the necke.  VICARY-E1-P2,46.75

Likewise it is to be noted, that there be three maner of fleshes in the
necke: VICARY-E1-P2,46.76

the first is called <font> Pixwex <$$font> or Seruisis, VICARY-E1-P2,46.77

and it is called of Chylder'Golde heire, or yellow heire,'the whiche are
certayne longitudinales lying on the sides of the Spondels from the head
downe to the latter Spondel.  VICARY-E1-P2,46.78

And they are ordeyned for this cause, that when the Senewes be weery of
ouer muche labour with mouing and $trauayle, that they might rest vpon
them as vpon a bedde.  VICARY-E1-P2,46.79

The second fleshe is musculus, from whome springeth the Tendons and
cordes that moue the head and the necke, whiche be numbred twentie,
as is afore declared: VICARY-E1-P2,46.80

The thirde fleshe replenisheth the voyde places, &c.  VICARY-E1-P2,46.81

The thirde parte of the necke is <P_47> called <font> Gutture <$$font>
, VICARY-E1-P2,47.82

and it is the standing out of the throte boll.  VICARY-E1-P2,47.83

The fourth part is called <font> Gula <$$font>, and the hinder parte
{COM:is_called} <font> Ceruix <$$font>, VICARY-E1-P2,47.84

and hath that name of the Philosophers, because of the marowe comming
to the Ridge bones.  VICARY-E1-P2,47.85

It is so called, because it is <paren> as it were <$$paren> a seruaunt
to the brayne: VICARY-E1-P2,47.86

For the necke receiueth and taketh of the brayne, influence of vertue
of mouing, VICARY-E1-P2,47.87

and sendeth it by senewes to other parts of the body downwardes, and to
al members of the body.  VICARY-E1-P2,47.88

Heere you shal vnderstand, that the way of the meate, & Mire or Isofagus ,
is al one thing; VICARY-E1-P2,47.89

and it is to be noted, that it stretcheth from the mouth to the stomache
, by the hinder part of the necke inwardly, fastned to the spondels of
the necke, vntyl he come to the fyfthe spondel, VICARY-E1-P2,47.90

and there he leaueth the spondel, VICARY-E1-P2,47.91

and stretcheth tyl he come to the $formost part of the brest, &
passeth through Diafragina tyl it come to the mouth of the stomacke,
VICARY-E1-P2,47.92

and there he is ended.  VICARY-E1-P2,47.93

Furthermore it is to be noted, that this Wesande is compounde and made
of two Tunikles or Cotes, that is to say, of the inner and of the vtter.
VICARY-E1-P2,47.94

The vtter tunikle is but simple, VICARY-E1-P2,47.95

for he needeth no retention but onely for his owne nourishing:
VICARY-E1-P2,47.96

but the inner Tunikle is compounde and made of Musculus Longitudinal
Wyl, by which he may drawe the meate from the mouth into the stomack,
as it shal be more playnely declared in the Anatomie of the stomacke.
VICARY-E1-P2,47.97

Furthermore, <font> Caua pulmonis via, trachia arteria <$$font>
, al <P_48> these be one thing, that is to say, the throte boll;
VICARY-E1-P2,48.98

and it is set within the necke besides y=e= Wesande towardes <font>
Gula <$$font>, VICARY-E1-P2,48.99

and is compounde of the grystle knytte eache with other.
VICARY-E1-P2,48.100

And that pannikle that is meane betweene the Wesand and the throte bol,
is called <font> Isinon <$$font>.  VICARY-E1-P2,48.101

Also ye shal vnderstand, that the great Veines which ramefie by the
sydes of the necke to the vpper part of the head, is of some men called
<font> Gwidege <$$font>, & of others <font> Vena organices <$$font>,
the incision of whom is perillous.  VICARY-E1-P2,48.102

And thus it is to be considered, that the Necke of man is compounde and
made of skinny fleshe, Ligamentes, and bones.  VICARY-E1-P2,48.103

And this suffiseth for the necke and the throte.  VICARY-E1-P2,48.104

<heading:edcomment:CHAPTER_VII>

<heading>

<font> The Anatomie of the <$$font> Shoulders and Armes.
VICARY-E1-P2,48.107

<$$heading>

And fyrst to speake of the bones: It is to be noted, that in the shoulder
there be two bones, that is to say, the Shoulder bone, and the Cannel
bone; VICARY-E1-P2,48.109

and also the adiutor bone of the arme are ioyned with y=e= shoulder
bones, VICARY-E1-P2,48.110

but they are not numbred among them, but amongst the bones of the armes.
VICARY-E1-P2,48.111

In the composition of the shoulder, the fyrst bone is <font> Os spatula
<$$font>, or shoulder blade, whose hinder part is declined towards y=e=
chinne, VICARY-E1-P2,48.112

& in that ende it is broade, & thin, VICARY-E1-P2,48.113

and in the vpper part it is round, in whose roundnes is a concauitie,
which is called y=e= boxe or coope of the shoulder, into which entereth
the Adiutor bones; VICARY-E1-P2,48.114

and they haue a bynding $together {TEXT:togethers} <P_49> with strong
flexible Senewes, VICARY-E1-P2,49.115

and are conteyned faste with the bone called <font> Clauicula <$$font>
, or the Cannel bone: VICARY-E1-P2,49.116

and this Cannel bone stretcheth to bothe the shoulders, one ende to the
one shoulder, and another to the other; VICARY-E1-P2,49.117

and there they make the composition of the shoulders.  VICARY-E1-P2,49.118

The bones of the great arme, that is to say, from the shoulder to the
fingers endes, be.xxx.  VICARY-E1-P2,49.119

The first is the Adiutor bone, whose vpper ende entreth into the
concauitie or boxe of the shoulder bone: VICARY-E1-P2,49.120

It is but one bone, hauing no felowe, VICARY-E1-P2,49.121

and it is hollowe, and ful of marowe; VICARY-E1-P2,49.122

and it is also crooked, because it shoulde be the more habler to grype
thinges; VICARY-E1-P2,49.123

and it is hollowe, because it should be lighter and more obedient to
the steering or mouing of the Brawnes.  VICARY-E1-P2,49.124

Furthermore, this bone hath two emynences, or two knobs in his nether
extremitie, or in the iuncture of the Elbowe, of the which the one is
more rising then the other, VICARY-E1-P2,49.125

and are made lyke vnto a Polly to drawe water with; VICARY-E1-P2,49.126

and the endes of these bones enter into a concauitie proportioned in the
vppermoste endes of the two Focel bones; of whiche two bones, the lesse
goeth from the Elbowe to the Thombe, by the vppermoste part of the arme,
and the greater is the nether bone from the Elbowe to the little finger.
VICARY-E1-P2,49.127

And these two bones be conteyned with the Adiutor bone,
VICARY-E1-P2,49.128

and bee bounde with strong Ligamentes, and in like maner with the bones
of the hande.  The whiche bones be numbred.viij. ; VICARY-E1-P2,49.129

the.iiij.  <P_50> vppermost be ioyned with the.iiij.  nethermost towardes
the handes: VICARY-E1-P2,50.130

and in the thirde warde of bones, be.v.  VICARY-E1-P2,50.131

and they are called <font> Ossa patinis <$$font>, VICARY-E1-P2,50.132

and they are in the palme of the hande.  VICARY-E1-P2,50.133

And to them be ioyned the bones of the Fingers and the Thombes, as thus
; in euery fynger.iii.  bones, and in the thombe two bones: that is to
say, in the fingers and thombe of euery hand.xiiij.  called <font> Ossa
digitorum <$$font>; in the palm of the hand.v.  called <font> Patinis;
<$$font> and betweene the hande and the wryste,.viij.  called <font>
Racete; <$$font> and from the wryst to the shoulder.iij.  bones: al
which beeing accompted together, ye shal finde thirtie bones in eche
hand and arme.  VICARY-E1-P2,50.134

To speake of Senewes, Lygamentes, Cordes and Brawnes: Here fyrst ye shal
vnderstand that there commeth from Mynuca, thorowe the Spondels of the
necke, foure senewes, which most playnly do appeare in sight, as thus:
VICARY-E1-P2,50.135

one commeth into the vpper parte of the arme, another into the nether
parte, and one into the inner side, and another into the vtter side of
y=e= arme; VICARY-E1-P2,50.136

and they bring from the brayne and from Minuca, both feeling and mouing
into the armes, as thus: VICARY-E1-P2,50.137

The senewes that come from the Brayne and from the marow of the backe
that is called Minuca, when they come to the iuncture of the shoulder
, there they are mixed with the Lygamentes of the selfe shoulder,
VICARY-E1-P2,50.138

and there the Lygamentes receyue both feeling and mouing of them;
VICARY-E1-P2,50.139

and also in their medling together, they are made a Corde or a Tendon.
VICARY-E1-P2,50.140

Three <P_51> causes I find why the senewes were medled with the Lygamentes
: VICARY-E1-P2,51.141

The first cause is, that the excellent feeling of the senewes, whiche
many waies be made weery by their continual mouing, should be repressed
by the insenciblenesse of the Lygaments: VICARY-E1-P2,51.142

The seconde is, that the littlenesse of the Senewes shoulde be fulfilled
through the quantitie of the Lygaments.  VICARY-E1-P2,51.143

The third is, the feeblenesse of the senewe, that is insufficiente and
too feeble to vse his offices, but by the strength and hardnes of the
Lygamentes.  VICARY-E1-P2,51.144

Nowe to declare what a Corde is, what a Ligament, and what a Muskle or
a Brawne, it is ynough rehearsed in the Chapter of the Simple members.
VICARY-E1-P2,51.145

But if you wyl, thorough the commaundement of the Wyl or of the Soule,
drawe the arme to the hinder part of the body, then the vtter Brawne is
drawen together, VICARY-E1-P2,51.146

and the inner is inlarged: VICARY-E1-P2,51.147

And likewise inwards, when the one brawne dothe drawe inwardes, the
other doth stretche; VICARY-E1-P2,51.148

& when the arme is stretched in length, then the Cordes be lengthened:
VICARY-E1-P2,51.149

but when they passe the iuncture of the shoulder and of the Elbowe, by
three fingers breadth or thereabout, then it is deuided by subtill wyl,
and medled with the simple fleshe: VICARY-E1-P2,51.150

and that whiche is made of it is called a Brawne.  VICARY-E1-P2,51.151

And three causes I find why that the simple fleshe is medled with the
Corde in the composition of the brawne: VICARY-E1-P2,51.152

The fyrst is, that the aforesayde Wylle might drawe in quiet through
the temperaunce of the fleshe.  VICARY-E1-P2,51.153

The seconde is, that they temper and abate the drought of the cord with
his moystnes, the which drought he getteth through his manifold mouing.
VICARY-E1-P2,51.154

The thirde is, that the forme of the brawny members shoulde be the more
fayre, and of better shape: wherefore God and nature haue clothed it
with a Panikle, that it might be the better kept.  VICARY-E1-P2,51.155

And it is called of <P_52> y=e= Philosophers'Musculus,'because it hath
a forme like vnto a Mouse.  VICARY-E1-P2,52.156

And when these Brawnes come neere a Ioynt, then the Cordes spring foorth
of them, VICARY-E1-P2,52.157

and are medled with the Lygaments agayne, VICARY-E1-P2,52.158

and so moueth that Ioynt.  VICARY-E1-P2,52.159

And so ye shall vnderstande, that alwayes betweene euery two Ioyntes,
is ingendred a Brawne, proportioned to the same member and place, vnto
the last extremitie of the fingers, so that aswell the least iuncture
hath a proper feeling and mouing when it needeth, as hath the greatest.
VICARY-E1-P2,52.160

And after Guydo, there be numbred.xiiij.  in the arme and hande, as
thus:.iiij.  in the Adiutor, mouing the vpper part of the arme: and.iiij.
in the Focels, mouing that part of the arme: and fiue in the hande,
mouing the fyngers.  VICARY-E1-P2,52.161

Now to speake somewhat of the Veynes and Arteirs of the arme: It is to
be vnderstoode, that from <font> Venakelis <$$font> there commeth two
braunches, VICARY-E1-P2,52.162

the one commeth to the one arme pyt, VICARY-E1-P2,52.163

and the other commeth to the other.  VICARY-E1-P2,52.164

And nowe marke the spreading; VICARY-E1-P2,52.165

for as it is of the one, so it is of the other, as thus:
VICARY-E1-P2,52.166

when the braunch is in the arme pyt, there he is deuyded into two
braunches; VICARY-E1-P2,52.167

the one braunche goeth along in the inner side of the arme vntil it come
to the bought of the arme, VICARY-E1-P2,52.168

and there it is called <font> Bazilica <$$font> or <font> Epatica <$$font>
, VICARY-E1-P2,52.169

<P_53>

and so goeth downe the arme til it come to the wryst, VICARY-E1-P2,53.171

and there it is turned to the backe of the hand, VICARY-E1-P2,53.172

and is found betwene the little fynger and the next, VICARY-E1-P2,53.173

and there it is called <font> Saluatella <$$font>.  VICARY-E1-P2,53.174

Nowe to the other braunche that is in the arme hole, which spreadeth to
the vtter side of the shoulder, VICARY-E1-P2,53.175

and there he deuideth in two: VICARY-E1-P2,53.176

y=e= one goeth spreading vp into y=e= carnous parte of the head,
VICARY-E1-P2,53.177

and after discendeth through the bone into the Brayne, as is declared
in the Anatomie of the head: VICARY-E1-P2,53.178

The other braunche goeth on the outward side of the arme,
VICARY-E1-P2,53.179

and there he is deuided in two also; VICARY-E1-P2,53.180

the one parte is ended at the hande, VICARY-E1-P2,53.181

and the other part is folded about the arme, tyl it appeare in the bought
of the arme, VICARY-E1-P2,53.182

and there it is called <font> Sephalica: <$$font> VICARY-E1-P2,53.183

from thence it goeth to the backe of the hande, VICARY-E1-P2,53.184

& appeareth betweene the thombe and the formost fynger;
VICARY-E1-P2,53.185

and there it is called <font> Sephalica occularis <$$font>.
VICARY-E1-P2,53.186

The two braunches that I spake of, whiche be diuided in the hinder
part of the shoulders; from eche of these two <paren> I say <$$paren>
springeth one; VICARY-E1-P2,53.187

and those two meete together, VICARY-E1-P2,53.188

and make one veyne, <P_54> which appeareth in the bought of the arme,
VICARY-E1-P2,54.189

and there it is called <font> Mediana <$$font>, or <font> Cordialis
<$$font>, or <font> Commine <$$font>.  VICARY-E1-P2,54.190

And thus it is to be vnderstoode, that of <font> vena Sephalica <$$font>
springeth <font> vena occularis; <$$font> and of <font> vena Bazilica
<$$font> springeth <font> vena Saluatella; <$$font> and of the two veynes
that meete, springeth <font> vena Mediana; <$$font> VICARY-E1-P2,54.191

and in ramefying from these fyue principal Veines springeth innumerable,
of the whiche a Chirurgion hath no great charge, VICARY-E1-P2,54.192

for it suffiseth vs to knowe the principale.  VICARY-E1-P2,54.193

To speake of Arteirs, you shall vnderstande, that wheresoeuer there is
founde a Veine, there is an Arteire vnder him: VICARY-E1-P2,54.194

and if there be founde a great Veine, there is found a great Arteir;
VICARY-E1-P2,54.195

and where as is a little Veine there is a little Arteir:
VICARY-E1-P2,54.196

For whersoeuer there goeth a veine to geue nutriment, there goeth an
Arteir to bring the spirite of lyfe.  Wherfore it is to be noted,
that the Arteirs lye more deeper in the flesh then the Veines doo:
VICARY-E1-P2,54.197

for they cary and kepe in them more precious blood than doth the Veine;
VICARY-E1-P2,54.198

and therefore he hath neede to be further from daungers outwardly:
VICARY-E1-P2,54.199

and therefore God and Nature haue ordeyned for him to be closed in two
cotes, where the Veine hath but one, &c.  VICARY-E1-P2,54.200

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample}

<P_71>

Nowe to speake of the Gal, or the chest of the Gal: VICARY-E1-P2,71.203

it is an official member, VICARY-E1-P2,71.204

and it is spermatike and senowy, VICARY-E1-P2,71.205

and hath in it a subtil wyl; VICARY-E1-P2,71.206

and it is a purse or a pannicular vesike in the holownesse of the Lyuer,
about the middle particle or lobe, ordeyned to receyue the Cholerike
superfluities which are ingendred in the Lyuer.  The which purse or
bagge hath three holes or neckes: VICARY-E1-P2,71.207

by the fyrste, he draweth to him from the Lyuer the choler, that the
blood be not hurt by the choler: VICARY-E1-P2,71.208

by the seconde necke, he sendeth to the bottome of the stomacke, Choler
to further the digestion of the stomacke: VICARY-E1-P2,71.209

And by the third neck, he sendeth the choler regularly from one
gutte to another, to chense them of their superfluities and drosse:
VICARY-E1-P2,71.210

and the quantitie of the purse may conteyne in it halfe a pinte, &c.
VICARY-E1-P2,71.211

And next is the Splen or the Milte, the which is a spermatike member, as
are other members, and official, and is the receptory of the melancolious
superfluities that are ingendred in the Liuer.  VICARY-E1-P2,71.212

And his place is on the lefte side transuerslye lincked to the stomacke
, VICARY-E1-P2,71.213

and his substaunce is thinne.  VICARY-E1-P2,71.214

And two causes I finde why he was ordeyned there: VICARY-E1-P2,71.215

The first is, that by the melancolious superfluities that are
ingendred of the Lyuer which he draweth to him, he is nourished with:
VICARY-E1-P2,71.216

The seconde cause is, that the nutritiue blood should by <P_72> him
be made the more purer and cleane, from the drosse and thicking of
melancolie, &c.  VICARY-E1-P2,72.217

And next of the Reynes and Kidnes: VICARY-E1-P2,72.218

It is to be vnderstoode, that within the region of the Nutrites
backwardes, are ordeyned the Kidnes, to clense the blood from the waterie
superfluities, VICARY-E1-P2,72.219

And they haue ech of them two passages, or holes, or neckes:
VICARY-E1-P2,72.220

by the one is drawen the water from Venakelis by two veynes, whiche are
called <font> vena emulgentes <$$font>, the length of a fynger of a man,
VICARY-E1-P2,72.221

and issueth from the Liuer: VICARY-E1-P2,72.222

and by the other is sente the same water to the Bladder,
VICARY-E1-P2,72.223

and is called <font> Poros vrithides <$$font>.  VICARY-E1-P2,72.224

The substaunce of the Kidnes is Lazartus fleshe, hauing Longitudinal wyl.
VICARY-E1-P2,72.225

And their place is behinde on eache side of the Spondles,
VICARY-E1-P2,72.226

and they are two in number; VICARY-E1-P2,72.227

and the righte Kidney lyeth somewhat hyer then the lefte,
VICARY-E1-P2,72.228

and is bounde fast to the backe with Lygamentes.  VICARY-E1-P2,72.229

The Philosopher sayth, that mans kidneys are like to the kidnes of
a Cowe, ful of harde knottes, hauing in him many harde concauities,
VICARY-E1-P2,72.230

and therefore the sores of them be harde to cure.  VICARY-E1-P2,72.231

Also they are more harder in substaunce then any other fleshy member,
VICARY-E1-P2,72.232

and that for two causes: VICARY-E1-P2,72.233

one is, that he bee not muche hurt of the sharpnesse of the vrin:
VICARY-E1-P2,72.234

The other is, that the same vrin that passeth from him might the better
be altered and clensed throughe the <P_73> same.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.235

Also there commeth from the harte to eche of the kydnes an Arteir , that
bringeth with him blood, heate, spirite, and lyfe.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.236

And in the same maner there commeth a veyne from the Lyuer, that
bringeth blood to nourishe the kydnes, called'blood nutrimental.
'VICARY-E1-P2,73.237

The grease of these kydnes or fatnes is as of other inwarde members,
VICARY-E1-P2,73.238

but it is an official member, made of thinne blood, congeled & cruded
through colde: VICARY-E1-P2,73.239

and there is ordeyned the greater quantitie in his place, because it
should receayue and temper the heate of the kydnes, which they haue of
the biting sharpnesse of the water.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.240

Nowe by the kydnes vpon the Spondels passeth <font> Venakelis <$$font>
, or <font> venecaua <$$font>, which is a veyne of a great substaunce,
VICARY-E1-P2,73.241

for he receyueth al the nutrimental blood from the Lyuer:
VICARY-E1-P2,73.242

and from him passeth many smal pypes on euery side; VICARY-E1-P2,73.243

and at the Spondel betweene the Shoulders, he deuideth him selfe whole
into two great braunches; VICARY-E1-P2,73.244

the one goeth into the one arme, and the other into the other,
VICARY-E1-P2,73.245

and there they deuide them selues into many veynes and branches: as it is
declared in the armes <paren> p. 52 <$$paren>.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.246

<heading:edcomment:CHAPTER_IX>

<heading>

<font> The Anatomie of the <$$font> Hanches and their parts.
VICARY-E1-P2,73.249

<$$heading>

The Hanches are the lower parte of the wombe, ioyning to the Thies,
and the secret members.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.251

And three thinges there are to be noted thereof: VICARY-E1-P2,73.252

the first is of the partes conteining: VICARY-E1-P2,73.253

the seconde is of the partes conteyned: VICARY-E1-P2,73.254

and the thirde is of the partes proceeding outwardes.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.255

The partes conteyning outwardly be <font> Myrac <$$font> and <font> Sifac
<$$font>, the <font> Zirbus <$$font>, and the bones.  VICARY-E1-P2,73.256

The partes conteyned inwardly, are the <font> Vezike <$$font>, or
bladder, the spermatike vessels, the Matrix in women, <P_74> <font>
Longaon <$$font>, Nerues, Veynes, and Arteirs dissending downwards.
VICARY-E1-P2,74.257

The partes proceeding outwardes, are The Buttockes, and the Muscles
dissending to the Thies, of whiche it is to be spoken of in order.
VICARY-E1-P2,74.258

And first of the partes conteyning, as of Myrac, Sifac, and Zirbus, there
is ynough spoken of in the Anatomie of the wombe.  VICARY-E1-P2,74.259

But as for the bones of the Hanches, There be of the partes of the backe
, three Spondels of <font> Ossa sacri <$$font>, or of the Hanches,
and three <font> cartilaginis <$$font> spondels of <font> Ossa caude
<$$font>, called The tayle bonne.  VICARY-E1-P2,74.260

And thus it is proued, that there is in euery man, woman and childe .xxx.
spondels; VICARY-E1-P2,74.261

and thus they are to be numbered: In the Necke.vij. , in the Ridge .xij. ,
in the Reynes.v. , and in the Hanches.vj.  VICARY-E1-P2,74.262

And it is to be noted, that euery spondel is hollowe in the middest,
through which holownesse passeth Nuca from the Brayne, or the marowe of
the backe.  VICARY-E1-P2,74.263

And some Authors say, that Mynuca is of the same substaunce that the
Brayne is of, VICARY-E1-P2,74.264

for it is like in substaunce, VICARY-E1-P2,74.265

and in it selfe geueth to the Nerues both the vertue of mouing and
feeling.  VICARY-E1-P2,74.266

And also euery Spondel is holed on euery side, through the which holes
both Arteirs and veynes doo bring from the hart and the Lyuer both lyfe &
nourishment, like as they doo to the brayne: VICARY-E1-P2,74.267

and from the pannicle of Minuca or the marowe of the backe, through
the holes of the sides of the spondels, springeth forth Nerues motiues;
VICARY-E1-P2,74.268

and there they intermedle them selues with the strong Lygamentes <P_75>
that be insencible; VICARY-E1-P2,75.269

and so the Lygamentes receayue that feeling of the Nerue which the Nerue
taketh of Mynuca.  VICARY-E1-P2,75.270

And by this reason may Autors proue, that Mynuca is of the same substaunce
that the Brayne is of, and the panicles of the Nuca is of the substaunce
of the pannikles of the Brayne, &c.  VICARY-E1-P2,75.271

And eche of these spondels be bounde fast one with another, so that one
of them maye not wel be moued without another.  VICARY-E1-P2,75.272

And so al these spondles together, conteined one by another, are called
y=e= Ridgbone, which is the fundation of al the shape of the body.
VICARY-E1-P2,75.273

They, with the laste spondel, be conteyned or ioyned to the bones of
the Hanches, VICARY-E1-P2,75.274

and they be the vpholders of al the spondles.  VICARY-E1-P2,75.275

And these bones be smal towardes the tayle bone, and broade towardes
the Hanches, and before they ioyne and make <font> Os pectinis <$$font>.
VICARY-E1-P2,75.276

And so they be brode in the partes of Iles, VICARY-E1-P2,75.277

and therefore some Authors calleth it <font> Ilea <$$font>.
VICARY-E1-P2,75.278

And ech of these two bones toward the lyuer hath a great rounde hole,
into the whiche is receyued the bone called <font> Vertebra <$$font>,
or The whorle bone; VICARY-E1-P2,75.279

Also besides that place there is a great hole or way, through the which
passeth from aboue Musculus, veynes and Arteirs, and go into the Thees.
VICARY-E1-P2,75.280

And thus it is to be noted, that of this bone <font> Pecten <$$font> ,
and the bone <font> Vertebra <$$font>, is made the iuncture of the Thye.
VICARY-E1-P2,75.281

<P_76>

Nowe to speake of the parts conteined: The first thing that commeth to
sight is the Bladder, the which is an official member, compounde of two
Neruous Pannicles, in complexion colde and dry, whose necke is carnous,
and hath Muscles to withholde, and to let go: VICARY-E1-P2,76.283

And in men it is long, VICARY-E1-P2,76.284

and is conteyned with the yard, passing through <font> Peritoneum;
<$$font> VICARY-E1-P2,76.285

but in women it is shorter, VICARY-E1-P2,76.286

and is conteyned within the <font> Vulua <$$font>.  VICARY-E1-P2,76.287

The place of the bladder is betweene the bone of the Share and the tayle
gutte called <font> Longaon; <$$font> VICARY-E1-P2,76.288

and in women it is betweene the foresayde Bone and Matrix.
VICARY-E1-P2,76.289

And in it is implanted two long vessels comming from the kidnes, whose
names be <font> Torri vrichides <$$font>, bringing with them the Urin
or water from the kidnes to the bladder, whiche priuily entreth into
the holes of the pannicles of the bladder by a natural mouing betweene
tunicle and tunicle; VICARY-E1-P2,76.290

and there the vrin fyndeth the hole of the nether tunikle,
VICARY-E1-P2,76.291

and there it entreth priuily into the concauitie of the bladder;
VICARY-E1-P2,76.292

and the more that the bladder is filled with vrin, the straighter be
the two tunicles comprised togeather; VICARY-E1-P2,76.293

for the holes of the tunicles be not euen, one agaynst another;
VICARY-E1-P2,76.294

and therefore if the bladder be never so ful, there may none goe backe
agayne.  VICARY-E1-P2,76.295

The forme of it is rounde; VICARY-E1-P2,76.296

the quantitie is a pitcher full; in some, more; & in some, lesse, &c.
VICARY-E1-P2,76.297

Also there is founde two other vessels, called <font> vaza seminaria
<$$font>, or the spermatike vessels.  VICARY-E1-P2,76.298

And they come from Venakelis, bringing blood to the Testikles, as wel
in man as in woman, in the which, by his further digestion, it is made
sparme or nature in men.  VICARY-E1-P2,76.299

They be put outwarde, VICARY-E1-P2,76.300

for the Testikles be without; VICARY-E1-P2,76.301

but <P_77> in women it abydeth within, VICARY-E1-P2,77.302

for their Testicles stande within, as it shal be declared hereafter.
VICARY-E1-P2,77.303

Next foloweth the Matrix in women: VICARY-E1-P2,77.304

The Matrix in woman is an official member, compounde and Nerueous,
and in complexion colde and dry.  VICARY-E1-P2,77.305

And it is the felde of mans generation; VICARY-E1-P2,77.306

and it is an instrument susceptiue, that is to say, a thing receying or
taking: VICARY-E1-P2,77.307

and her proper place is betweene the bladder and the gutte <font> Longaon:
<$$font> VICARY-E1-P2,77.308

the likenes of it is as it were a yarde reuersed or turned inwarde,
hauing testikles likewise, as aforesaid: VICARY-E1-P2,77.309

also the Matrix hath two concauities or selles, and no more;
VICARY-E1-P2,77.310

but al beasts haue as many selles as they haue pappes heades.
VICARY-E1-P2,77.311

Also it hath a long necke lyke an vrinal; VICARY-E1-P2,77.312

& in euery necke it hath a mouth, that is to saye, one within, and an
other without.  VICARY-E1-P2,77.313

The inner in the tyme of conception is shutte, VICARY-E1-P2,77.314

and the vtter parte is open, as it was before: VICARY-E1-P2,77.315

and it hath in the middest a Lazartus pannicle, whiche is called in
Laten <font> Tentigo <$$font>.  VICARY-E1-P2,77.316

And in the creation of this Pannicle is founde two vtilities:
VICARY-E1-P2,77.317

The first is, that by it goeth forth the vrin, VICARY-E1-P2,77.318

or els it should be shed through out al the Vulua: VICARY-E1-P2,77.319

The seconde is, that when a woman doth set hir thies abrode, it
altereth the ayre that commeth to the Matrix for to temper the heat.
VICARY-E1-P2,77.320

Furthermore, the necke that is betweene these two foresayde mouthes,
in her concauitie hath many inuolutions and pleates, ioyned together
in the maner of Rose leaues before they be fully spread or ripe,
VICARY-E1-P2,77.321

and so they be shut togeather as a Purse mouth, so that nothing may
passe foorth but vrin, vntil the time of chylding.  VICARY-E1-P2,77.322

Also about the middle of this necke be certain veynes in Maydens, the
which in tyme of deflouring be corrupt & broken.  VICARY-E1-P2,77.323

Furthermore, in the <P_78> sides of the vtter mouth of the mouth are
two testicles or stones, and also two vessels of sparme, shorter than
mans vessels; VICARY-E1-P2,78.324

and in time of coyt the womans sperme is shed downe into the bottome of
the Matrix.  VICARY-E1-P2,78.325

Also from the Lyuer there commeth to the Matrix many veynes, bringing
to the childe nourishing at the time of a womans beeing with childe:
VICARY-E1-P2,78.326

and those veynes, at suche time as the Matrix is voyde, bring therto
superfluities from certayne members of the body, whereof are ingendred
womans flowres, &c.  VICARY-E1-P2,78.327

And forasmuche as it hath pleased almightie God to geue the knowledge of
these his mysteries and workes vnto his creatures in this present worlde
, Here I purpose to declare what thing Embreon is, and his creation.
VICARY-E1-P2,78.328

The noble Philosophers, as Galen, Auicen, Bartholomeus, and diuers other
writing vpon this matter, say, That Embreon is a thing ingendred in
the mothers wombe, the original whereof is y=e= sparme of the man and
the woman, of the which is made, by the might and power of God, in the
mothers wombe a chylde, as hereafter more at large shal be declared.
VICARY-E1-P2,78.329

First, the feelde of generation called the Matrix, or the mother, is
knowen in the anatomie, whose place is properly betwixt the Bladder and
Longaon in the woman, in which place is sowen, by the tillage of man,
a couenable matter of kindly heate; VICARY-E1-P2,78.330

for kindly heate is cause efficeens bothe of dooing and working, and
spirite that geueth vertue to the body, and gouerneth and ruleth that
vertue: the which seede of generation commeth from al the partes of the
body, both of the <P_79> man and the woman, with consent & wyl of al
members, and is shed into the place of conceyuing, where, through the
vertue of Nature, it is gathered together in the selles of the matrix or
the mother, in whom - by the way of the working of mans seede, and by the
way of suffering of the womans seede mixte together, so that eche of them
worketh in other, and suffereth in other - there is ingendred Embreon.
VICARY-E1-P2,79.331

And further it is to be noted, that this sparme that commeth both of
man and woman, is made & gathered of the most best and purest drops of
blood in all the body; VICARY-E1-P2,79.332

and by the labour and chafing of the testikles or stones, this blood is
turned into another kinde, VICARY-E1-P2,79.333

and is made sparme.  VICARY-E1-P2,79.334

And in man it is hotte, white, & thicke, wherfore it may not spread nor
runne abroade of it selfe, but runneth and taketh temperaunce of the
womans sparme, which hath contrarie qualities; VICARY-E1-P2,79.335

for the womans sparme is thinner, colder, and feebler.
VICARY-E1-P2,79.336

And as some Authors holde opinion, when this matter is gathered into the
right side of the matrix, then it happeneth a male kinde; and likewise
on the left, the female; VICARY-E1-P2,79.337

and where the vertue is most, there it sauoureth most.
VICARY-E1-P2,79.338

And further it is to be noted, that lyke as the Renet of the Cheese hath
by him selfe the way or vertue of working, so hath the mylke by way of
suffering: VICARY-E1-P2,79.339

and as the Renet and mylke make the cheese, so doth the sparme of man
and woman make the generation of Embreon, of the which thing springeth ,
by the vertue of kindly heate, a certayne skinne or caule, into the which
it lappeth it selfe in, wherewith afterwardes it is tyed to the mothers
wombe, the whiche couering commeth foorth with the byrth of the childe;
VICARY-E1-P2,79.340

and if it happen that any of the skinne remaine after the byrth of the
childe, then is the woman in peril of her lyfe.  VICARY-E1-P2,79.341

<P_80>

Furthermore it is sayde, that of this Embreon is ingendred the Hart, the
Lyuer, the Brayne, Nerues, veynes, Arteirs, Cordes, Lygamentes , Skinnes,
Gristles, & Bones, receyuing to them by kindly vertue the menstrual blood,
of whiche is ingendred both fleshe and fatnes.  VICARY-E1-P2,80.343

And as wryters say, the fyrst thing that is shapen be the principals,
as is the Harte, Lyuer, and Brayne.  VICARY-E1-P2,80.344

For of the Hart springeth the Arteirs, of the Lyuer the Veynes, and of
the Brayne the Nerues: VICARY-E1-P2,80.345

and when these are made, Nature maketh & shapeth Bones and grystles
to keepe & saue them, as the bones of the head for the Brayne
, the Brest-bones and the Ribbes for the Harte and the Lyuer.
VICARY-E1-P2,80.346

And after these springeth al other member, one after another.
VICARY-E1-P2,80.347

And thus is the childe bred foorth in four degrees, as thus:
VICARY-E1-P2,80.348

The first is, when sayde sparme or seede is at the fyrst as it were
mylke: VICARY-E1-P2,80.349

The seconde is, when it is turned from that kinde into another kinde,
VICARY-E1-P2,80.350

$it is yet but as a lumpe of blood; VICARY-E1-P2,80.351

and this is called of Ypocras, <font> Fettus: <$$font> VICARY-E1-P2,80.352

The thirde degree is, when the principals be shapen, as the Hart, lyuer,
and Brayne: VICARY-E1-P2,80.353

The fourth and laste, as when al the other members be perfectly shapen,
then it receyeth the soule with life and breath; VICARY-E1-P2,80.354

and then it beginneth to moue it-selfe alone.  VICARY-E1-P2,80.355

Nowe in these foure degrees aforesayde, in the fyrst, as milke, it
containeth vij. dayes: in the seconde, as Feetus, ix.
dayes: in the thirde, as a lumpe of fleshe ingendring the principals,
the space of ix. dayes: VICARY-E1-P2,80.356

and the fourth, vnto the tyme of ful perfection of al the whole members,
is the space of xviij. dayes: VICARY-E1-P2,80.357

So is there xlvj. dayes from the day of conception vnto the
day of ful perfection and receyuing of the soule, as God best knoweth.
VICARY-E1-P2,80.358
