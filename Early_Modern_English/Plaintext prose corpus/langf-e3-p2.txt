<P_46>

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4.  LANGF-E3-P2,46.2

I am now going to discribe another way that I never read of, neither ever
knew more than one that used it, and he a skilful Gardiner and us'd it
very much: LANGF-E3-P2,46.3

Knowing no name for it I have given it the name of <font> Side-graffing
<$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,46.4

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} done by preparing the <font> Scion <$$font> as in
<font> Whip-graffing <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,46.5

then without cutting off the head of the <font> Stock <$$font>, <paren>
but making it thin of side Branches <$$paren> from a smooth place of it
on the <font> West-side <$$font>, take off as much <font> bark <$$font>
as the <font> Scion <$$font> will cover <paren> as in <font> Packing
<$$font> <$$paren> LANGF-E3-P2,46.6

and slit both <font> Scion <$$font> and <font> Stock <$$font>, according
to the directions given of Lipping or Tonguing in the end of the last
<font> Section <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,46.7

and fix them together accordingly: LANGF-E3-P2,46.8

Bind it close LANGF-E3-P2,46.9

and <font> clay <$$font> it.  LANGF-E3-P2,46.10

If it grow, at a years end cut off the top of the <font> Stock <$$font>
at the <font> graffed <$$font> place slopewise, LANGF-E3-P2,46.11

and <font> clay <$$font> it.  LANGF-E3-P2,46.12

<P_47>

Some done thus grow well, LANGF-E3-P2,47.14

and I have used it successfully, the transient sap uniting it well to
the <font> Stock <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,47.15

and it groweth fast if the head of the <font> Stock <$$font> be not too
big to rob it of the sap and drop upon it, LANGF-E3-P2,47.16

therefore suffer not the top of the <font> Stock <$$font> much to over
grow the <font> Scion <$$font> the first year before $it $'s {TEXT:it's}
cut quite off.  LANGF-E3-P2,47.17

There is another way of this kind, I have known used, LANGF-E3-P2,47.18

and is easier done than the former, LANGF-E3-P2,47.19

that is, to slit the <font> bark <$$font> of the <font> Stock <$$font>
in the form of a great T, and loosening it with the point of a Knife,
and then clapping in a <font> Scion <$$font>, prepared as hath been
said before, <paren> but without the slit for <font> Lipping <$$font>
, <$$paren> LANGF-E3-P2,47.20

<font> bind <$$font> and <font> clay <$$font> it.  LANGF-E3-P2,47.21

This can be used only when the bark will part from the <font> Stock
<$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,47.22

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5.  LANGF-E3-P2,47.23

The next way is that which is called <font> Graffing <$$font> in the
<font> Cleft <$$font>, and is very ancient, and still used by <font>
common-Planters <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,47.24

and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} thus performed.  LANGF-E3-P2,47.25

Cut off the head of the <font> Stock <$$font> even and smooth,
LANGF-E3-P2,47.26

cleave it with a strong <font> Knife <$$font>, or <font> Chissel <$$font>
, <paren> hereafter described when I speak of <font> Pruning <$$font>
big Trees <$$paren> LANGF-E3-P2,47.27

let the slit run near two inches deep, LANGF-E3-P2,47.28

let it be as near the middle of the <font> stock <$$font> as you
can, but not in the <font> pith <$$font> or <font> heart <$$font>;
LANGF-E3-P2,47.29

have in readiness a stick of hard Wood, near a foot <P_48> long, at one
end made like a <font> wedge <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,48.30

when you have taken out the <font> Cleaver <$$font>, put the <font>
wedg <$$font> into the <font> slit <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,48.31

and open it so wide as to put in the <font> Scion <$$font>, when $it
$'s {TEXT:it's} prepared.  Which is by cutting it down <font> slope
<$$font> on each side, about an inch in length, beginning at the joynt
, but leaving it much thinner on that side that goeth into the <font>
Stock <$$font> than the other that is outward, LANGF-E3-P2,48.32

<paren> that side must be outward that will cause it to lean rather <font>
outward <$$font> than <font> inward <$$font>; <$$paren> LANGF-E3-P2,48.33

you may let it have a shoulder on one side, or both, or neither,
LANGF-E3-P2,48.34

all these ways are used; LANGF-E3-P2,48.35

but shouldering takes up more time, LANGF-E3-P2,48.36

and makes the <font> Scion weaker <$$font>, and so apter by any chance
to be broke off.  LANGF-E3-P2,48.37

Then with your Knife cut away any <font> jags <$$font>, or <font>
roughness <$$font>, or <font> blackness <$$font> that remains
after cleaving on each side of the <font> cleft <$$font> within,
LANGF-E3-P2,48.38

and so put in either <font> one <$$font> or <font> two Scions <$$font>
<paren> according as your <font> stock <$$font> is in bigness, <$$paren>
LANGF-E3-P2,48.39

place them so as the passage of the <font> sap <$$font> betwixt the <font>
bark <$$font> and <font> wood <$$font>, both of the <font> Stock <$$font>
and <font> Scion <$$font>, may meet all along the <font> cleft <$$font>
, as near as you can; LANGF-E3-P2,48.40

draw then forth your <font> wedge <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,48.41

and if the stock be a big strong stock, and do pinch the <font> Graffs
<$$font>, drive a little wedge of dry wood into the <font> slit <$$font>,
but not so as to let the <font> Scions <$$font> loose; LANGF-E3-P2,48.42

<P_49_misnumbered_as_59>

or for such strong stocks cut the <font> Graffs <$$font> as thick on
that side that goes into the stock, as on the outside, which will prevent
the stocks hurting the sappy part and <font> bark <$$font> of the Scion.
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.44

Many cleave big stocks cross-wise again,
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.45

and put in two more <font> Scions <$$font>
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.46

but cleaving hurts the stock so much that you had better <paren> if you
will have more than two <font> Scions <$$font> in one stock <$$paren>
<font> Graff <$$font> the other two in the bark, according to the <font>
second <$$font> way of <font> Graffing <$$font>, forecasting one of them
to be on the <font> West-side <$$font> of the <font> stock <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.47

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6.  LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.48

There is another way, called <font> Graffing <$$font> by <font> Approach,
Ablactation, <$$font> or <font> Enarching <$$font>, which is by having
a <font> stock <$$font>, or <font> stocks <$$font> grow so near another
Tree, whose <font> Fruit <$$font> you would propagate, that the <font>
stock <$$font> and the <font> branch <$$font> of that Tree may be joyned
together in the manner following; or else <font> stocks <$$font> raised
in <font> Pots <$$font>, that may be placed near the Tree of whose kind
you would propagate; as is commonly used for <font> Orange-Trees <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.49

Cut the side of the <font> Branch <$$font> and of the <font> stock
<$$font> <paren> where they will meet <$$paren> about three inches
in length, till you come near the <font> pith <$$font> of each,
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.50

and fit them both together, that the passages of the sap may joyn,
in which posture <font> bind <$$font> and <font> clay <$$font> them:
LANGF-E3-P2,49_misnumbered_as_59.51

Assoon <P_50> as you find the <font> Scion <$$font> and <font> Stock
<$$font> to be well cemented together, cut off the head of the <font>
Stock <$$font>, about four inches above the binding; LANGF-E3-P2,50.52

and in <font> March <$$font> following, cut off the stub you left of the
<font> Stock <$$font>, and also the <font> Scion <$$font> underneath,
close to the Graffed place, that it may subsist by the Stock only.
LANGF-E3-P2,50.53

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} also used to be done by cutting off the head of
the <font> Stock <$$font> at first, and sloping half off about two
inches long, and joyning the <font> Scion <$$font> thereunto, being
cut accordingly.  LANGF-E3-P2,50.54

<font> See the figure.  <$$font> LANGF-E3-P2,50.55

This manner of <font> Graffing <$$font> is unnecessary, and scarcely
practicable in the <font> Fruit-Trees <$$font>, chiefly intended in this
Book; LANGF-E3-P2,50.56

but for <font> Oranges, Limons, Pomgranates, Vines, Jessamins
<$$font>, and such like <font> shrubs <$$font> it may be practis'd.
LANGF-E3-P2,50.57

Also $it $'s {TEXT:it's} said that Trees of different kinds will sooner
take this way than otherwise.  LANGF-E3-P2,50.58

Among all these sorts of <font> Graffing <$$font>, the second way for
<font> Apples <$$font>, and the first for all other <font> Fruit-trees
<$$font>, are to be preferred before all the rest.  LANGF-E3-P2,50.59

The Figures with these directions, I hope will make all easie to any
mans understanding.  LANGF-E3-P2,50.60

<font> Observations concerning Graffing.  LANGF-E3-P2,51.64

<$$heading>

Sect. <$$font> 1.  LANGF-E3-P2,51.66

If the <font> Plants <$$font> that you removed out of your <font>
Seed-plot <$$font> into the <font> Nursery <$$font>, and such <font>
Stocks <$$font> for <font> Stone-fruit <$$font> in the <font> Seed-plot
<$$font> as you intend to <font> Graff <$$font>, be half an inch over in
thickness, where they are to be <font> Graffed <$$font>, or little more,
$it $'s {TEXT:it's} enough: LANGF-E3-P2,51.67

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} best not to have them above an inch in the diameter
, both that you may lose no time, and that the <font> Stock <$$font>
may be easier covered by the <font> Scion <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,51.68

<font> Sect. <$$font> 2.  LANGF-E3-P2,51.69

In providing <font> Scions <$$font> or <font> Graffs <$$font> of <font>
Pears, Plums <$$font> and <font> Cherries <$$font> you must observe to
cut them in <font> January <$$font>, or at the very beginning of <font>
February <$$font>, having respect to the forwardness or backwardness
of the Spring, and the warmth or coldness of the Country you live in;
LANGF-E3-P2,51.70

but you must be sure to cut them before the buds have any speck of white
appear upon them.  LANGF-E3-P2,51.71

<font> Scions <$$font> for <font> Apple-trees <$$font> will seldom be
too forward any time before the beginning of <font> March <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,51.72

Choose strong and well grown <font> Scions <$$font>, that grow at the
top or outside of a <font> Tree <$$font> that bears well, and good fruit
of its <P_52> kind, LANGF-E3-P2,52.73

and cut not off the tops of the <font> Scions <$$font> till you <font>
Graff <$$font> them, LANGF-E3-P2,52.74

for so they will keep the better.  LANGF-E3-P2,52.75

I have always found a <font> shoot <$$font> or <font> branch <$$font>
of the year next foregoing to thrive best; LANGF-E3-P2,52.76

and though in <font> Graffing <$$font> old Trees in <font> Hereford-shire
<$$font>, some commend and use <font> Scions <$$font> of <font> two
<$$font> or <font> three <$$font> years growth, yet those are seldom found
to have convenient <font> buds <$$font> to put forth at, LANGF-E3-P2,52.77

and often times have <font> blossoming <$$font> buds on them,
LANGF-E3-P2,52.78

and make not so good a growth, LANGF-E3-P2,52.79

neither have they so good a <font> joynt <$$font> to <font> Graff <$$font>
at, as those of the last year.  LANGF-E3-P2,52.80

When you get them, you had best cut off at least a hands breadth of
that which grew the year before with them, besides the last years <font>
shoot <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,52.81

for so they will keep the better, LANGF-E3-P2,52.82

and you must use about an inch of that old wood in every <font> Scion
<$$font> when you <font> Graff <$$font> it.  LANGF-E3-P2,52.83

<font> Sect. <$$font> 3.  LANGF-E3-P2,52.84

In <font> January <$$font> or <font> February <$$font>, as you find the
weather grow warm, the wind not being <font> North <$$font>, or <font>
North-East <$$font>, you may Graff <font> Plums, Cherries <$$font>, and
<font> Pears <$$font>, but not <font> Apples <$$font> till the <font>
bark <$$font> of the <font> Stocks <$$font> will <font> rise <$$font> or
<font> peel <$$font> from the wood, which is seldom before the middle of
<font> March <$$font>, and often not till <font> April <$$font>, because
this is necessary for the best way <P_53> of <font> Graffing <$$font>
them; LANGF-E3-P2,53.85

but if you will <font> Graff <$$font> any <font> Apples <$$font> in the
<font> cleft <$$font>, you may do it a little sooner.  LANGF-E3-P2,53.86

Perhaps you may not have several sorts of <font> Plums, Cherries <$$font>
or <font> Pears <$$font>, so near you as that you may get <font> buds
<$$font> fresh enough for <font> Inoculation <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,53.87

In this case you may procure <font> Scions <$$font> and <font> Graff
<$$font> them, LANGF-E3-P2,53.88

and they will continue fresh though you should send for them from
beyond Sea.  LANGF-E3-P2,53.89

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4.  LANGF-E3-P2,53.90

These <font> Scions <$$font> may be kept three <font> weeks <$$font>,
or a <font> month <$$font> after they are cut, before they are used,
LANGF-E3-P2,53.91

and there ought to be a <font> fortnight <$$font> or <font> three weeks
<$$font> betwixt the time of their being <font> cut <$$font>, and of
their being <font> Graffed <$$font>, that the <font> Stocks <$$font>
in that time may be more replenisht with <font> sap <$$font>, and the
<font> Scions <$$font> be more empty of it.  LANGF-E3-P2,53.92

To keep your <font> Scions <$$font> or <font> Graffs <$$font> after they
are cut, you need not, as some direct, bury them in <font> moist mold
<$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,53.93

for this may be a means to make them swell and bud forth, by receiving
moisture from the <font> Earth <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,53.94

and then when by <font> Graffing <$$font> they are exposed to the cold
open <font> Air <$$font>, they will be in danger to wither and die before
they have nourishment from the <font> Stock <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,53.95

<P_54>

You may lay them in a dry house, so it be near no heat, or under an old
Tree, or Hedge, and cover them all over with <font> dry mold <$$font> ,
that the <font> Air <$$font> may not have too much influence upon them :
LANGF-E3-P2,54.97

though they seem somewhat dry, yet if they cut with a fresh colour,
and be not much withered, they will not grow the worse, but rather the
better; LANGF-E3-P2,54.98

yea some that have seemed withered, being carried in a Cloak-bag <font>
seventy <$$font> or <font> eighty <$$font> miles have grown well.
LANGF-E3-P2,54.99

Suffer not the <font> buds <$$font> to be hurt, or rub'd in the <font>
binding <$$font> or <font> carriage <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,54.100

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5.  LANGF-E3-P2,54.101

There be some indifferent whether they <font> Graff <$$font> at a
<font> joynt <$$font> or no, but forecast to have a <font> bud <$$font>
directly behind the <font> shoulder <$$font> of the <font> Scion <$$font>
: LANGF-E3-P2,54.102

If <font> Scions <$$font> with <font> joynts <$$font> were scarce, you
might practise so on small <font> Stocks <$$font> that will be speedily
cover'd, LANGF-E3-P2,54.103

but if <font> Scions <$$font> can be had with <font> joints <$$font>,
never <font> Graff <$$font> with others, LANGF-E3-P2,54.104

for these will cover the <font> Stocks <$$font> sooner.
LANGF-E3-P2,54.105

It will do well in <font> Graffing Stocks <$$font> for large <font>
Standards <$$font>, to put but one <font> Scion <$$font> into a Stock,
and if it put forth several <font> shoots <$$font> to cut off all but one,
that is the straightest and strongest.  LANGF-E3-P2,54.106

But for <font> Dwarfs <$$font> and <font> Wall-fruit <$$font> put in
<font> two Scions <$$font>, if the <font> Stock <$$font> be big enough.
LANGF-E3-P2,54.107

Let the latter be <P_55> <font> Graffed <$$font> near the ground,
the former at such height as the <font> Stock <$$font> will allow.
LANGF-E3-P2,55.108

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6.  LANGF-E3-P2,55.109

In <font> Graffing <$$font> or <font> Inoculating <$$font>, it may be
necessary to have some <font> mark <$$font>, to know what kind of <font>
Fruit <$$font> is put upon each Stock; LANGF-E3-P2,55.110

if you Graff many of one kind, <paren> as $it $'s {TEXT:it's} necessary
for <font> Syder-Fruit <$$font> <$$paren> you may observe to make
every <font> row <$$font> to consist but of one kind, and no other;
LANGF-E3-P2,55.111

but in a Book, that such a row hath such a kind of <font> Fruit <$$font>
in it, and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} but entring where there are several in
one row, there may be a Stake knockt into the ground at the beginning
of every new sort, and so entred in your Book; LANGF-E3-P2,55.112

and where you have very few of a kind <paren> or for your whole
<font> Nursery <$$font>, if you please <$$paren> you may make <font>
marks <$$font> of several <font> figures <$$font> or shapes, in the
<font> bark <$$font> of the <font> Stocks <$$font>; which <font> marks
<$$font> enter into your Book, and what <font> kind <$$font> it denotes,
LANGF-E3-P2,55.113

and at two or three years when you remove it, the mark will be very
visible; LANGF-E3-P2,55.114

and by renewing the marks sometimes, you may continue it as long as you
please, LANGF-E3-P2,55.115

and if any Tree be stolen you may own it by the mark.  LANGF-E3-P2,55.116

CHAP. VIII.  LANGF-E3-P2,56.119

<font> Of Planting Wall-Fruit.  LANGF-E3-P2,56.120

<$$heading>

Sect. <$$font> 1.  LANGF-E3-P2,56.122

<font> Stone-fruit <$$font> will be first ready to remove,
LANGF-E3-P2,56.123

for after two years growth in the Seed-plot or Nursery, after they are
Inoculated, or Graffed, you may well remove them, be they for <font>
Wall <$$font> or <font> Dwarfs <$$font>, which you ought to do in <font>
October <$$font> or <font> November <$$font>; early removing, being
advantageous for all <font> Fruit-Trees <$$font>, both for the security
of their growing, and for their well growing.  LANGF-E3-P2,56.124

Young <font> Trees <$$font>, having been taken up about <font> November
<$$font>, and the ends of the roots cut off, and laid in the Earth till
<font> March <$$font> to be Planted, being then taken forth again , it
hath appeared that they have put out many fibrous roots, at the ends of
those big roots that were cut off; which had they done in the place they
were to grow in the next Summer, this would have been a good preparation
against Spring; LANGF-E3-P2,56.125

and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} always seen that Trees set in <font>
February <$$font> or <font> March <$$font>, make generally a much less
growth the next <P_57> year, than those that were set before Winter.
LANGF-E3-P2,57.126

If a dry Summer happen to succeed, it often kills some of the late set
Trees, LANGF-E3-P2,57.127

and puts such a stop to others, that they recover not of many years.
LANGF-E3-P2,57.128

In sharp Frosts, though you could dig, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} not good to
remove Trees.  LANGF-E3-P2,57.129

Yet if you have a few small <font> Trees <$$font> near hand to remove,
you may make advantage of a small <font> Frost <$$font>, by removing
them, in getting up the <font> Earth <$$font> whole about the roots of
the Tree, LANGF-E3-P2,57.130

and set it presently letting as little Earth <font> fall <$$font> from
them as may be, whereby the Tree may be scarcely sensible of <font>
removing <$$font>: LANGF-E3-P2,57.131

And at all times if you have not far to carry the <font> Trees <$$font>
to set them, knock not off the mold from the <font> roots <$$font> ,
LANGF-E3-P2,57.132

but preserve as much as you can about them.  LANGF-E3-P2,57.133

<font> Sect. <$$font> 2.  LANGF-E3-P2,57.134

Make a Trench by the Wall-side you are to set them up to, about two foot
broad, and as deep, LANGF-E3-P2,57.135

and in every place where a Tree is to be set, about a yard square,
mingle good <font> old rotten Neats-dung <$$font>, with the Earth,
LANGF-E3-P2,57.136

and fill it up lightly, near as high as you intend the borders to be,
LANGF-E3-P2,57.137

and tread it down; So that it be not above half full in the places you
designed to set the trees, LANGF-E3-P2,57.138

as to the borders make them up when you please.  LANGF-E3-P2,57.139

<P_58>

But if you design no borders, make then only a hole for each Tree,
of the square before mentioned: LANGF-E3-P2,58.141

And if your <font> Soil <$$font> be <font> wet <$$font>, or <font>
binding gravel <$$font>, or such like, very bad in the bottom, go not
so deep, LANGF-E3-P2,58.142

it will be better to set them shallow, and raise the Earth about them.
LANGF-E3-P2,58.143

I knew an excellent <font> Planter <$$font>, that in a blewish clay
ground, used at the bottom of the <font> hole <$$font> to set a broad
stone, to prevent the Roots of the <font> Trees <$$font> in runing
downward, LANGF-E3-P2,58.144

and certainly where the Land is spungy or bad in the bottom, you $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} set the Trees too shallow; so that the Earth be
deep enough above them to prevent the Sun's burning them the Summer.
LANGF-E3-P2,58.145

As to the distance <font> Wall-fruit-trees <$$font> are to be set at,
where they are apt to grow, you may learn that best by considering their
aptness to spread: LANGF-E3-P2,58.146

<font> Apricocks <$$font> and <font> Pears <$$font> spread most,
LANGF-E3-P2,58.147

the <font> May Cherry <$$font> and some others are of very small growth
: LANGF-E3-P2,58.148

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} impossible to give rules for all, LANGF-E3-P2,58.149

but the general distance is about four yards asunder.  LANGF-E3-P2,58.150

<font> Sect. <$$font> 3.  LANGF-E3-P2,58.151

If it be not a manur'd Land you set them in, have in readiness some
very <font> fine rich Mold <$$font>, or <font> shovellings <$$font> of a
yard <P_59> where Cattle are frequently lodged or fed, that hath lain on
heaps till $it $'s {TEXT:it's} <font> mellow <$$font>, and become dry,
or <font> rotten Neats-dung <$$font>, which you may mix with the Earth
that came forth of the hole, LANGF-E3-P2,59.152

and so order it, that it may be as good or better, than that out of
which your Trees came: LANGF-E3-P2,59.153

Fill the hole half way up with this, LANGF-E3-P2,59.154

and tread it down in such form <paren> having respect to the <font>
roots <$$font> of the Tree that is set in it <$$paren> that the <font>
roots <$$font> may rest close upon it.  LANGF-E3-P2,59.155

Cut off the ends of all the <font> roots <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,59.156

<paren> if it chance to have one long downright <font> root <$$font>,
you may cut it almost half off, <$$paren> LANGF-E3-P2,59.157

try <paren> by setting the Tree in the hole <$$paren> which side will
stand best to the Wall, LANGF-E3-P2,59.158

and then cut off such branches as grow directly toward, and fromward
the Wall, leaving only the side branches, to be nail'd unto it,
LANGF-E3-P2,59.159

then clap your Tree in, placing it as far from the Wall as the <font>
top <$$font> will allow, LANGF-E3-P2,59.160

that must be spread upon it, that the <font> roots <$$font> may have
the more liberty to spread backwards: LANGF-E3-P2,59.161

fill up the hole with the <font> mold <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,59.162

and use all diligence to place the <font> roots <$$font> of your Tree in
the same posture they were in before you removed it.  LANGF-E3-P2,59.163

If the Tree be young, and the <font> Roots <$$font> slender, this can be
performed no way but by throwing in a little soil at a time, <P_60> and
then raising up with your hands such <font> Roots <$$font> as are pressed
down by it below their proper situation, spreading them on the soil you
have cast in, and then throwing in more, and ordering the Roots as before,
so continuing to do till you have filled up the hole.  LANGF-E3-P2,60.164

Old Trees with sturdy Roots do not require so much curiosity;
LANGF-E3-P2,60.165

but you must be sure that the mold lie close under, betwixt, and among
the Roots.  LANGF-E3-P2,60.166

If the <font> Soil <$$font> be <font> light <$$font>, you must press it
down gently with your foot, LANGF-E3-P2,60.167

when you have finished placing the Earth about them, you may <paren>
if the Land be stiff, cold, wet, or barren <$$paren> cover the Earth
with Dung, round about the Tree, LANGF-E3-P2,60.168

but if the Land be good, or that you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} spare Dung
, then in the end of <font> February <$$font> following cover the Earth
with <font> Fearn <$$font> or <font> Straw <$$font> almost a foot thick
, LANGF-E3-P2,60.169

and this do then, rather than when you set the Tree that Earth may
have more benefit of the Frost and Wet in the Winter to temper it.
LANGF-E3-P2,60.170

And some in setting Trees esteem it best to put no Dung into the holes
, but the soil that came forth of it, both under and about the <font>
Roots <$$font>, placing the smallest and best mold next them, <P_61>
laying a good quantity of Dung on the top of the Earth about them.
LANGF-E3-P2,61.171

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4.  LANGF-E3-P2,61.172

Every year it will be necessary to <font> prune <$$font> and <font>
nail <$$font> them to the Wall, <font> twice <$$font>, or <font> thrice
<$$font>, according as they grow more or less; wherein you must observe,
to bend down the strongest <font> shoots <$$font> <paren> that would
grow upward <$$paren> towards the sides, LANGF-E3-P2,61.173

otherwise they will be apt to run straight upward, and not cover the
space you design for them, LANGF-E3-P2,61.174

and by their luxurious growth, will extreamly rob the side branches of
their nourishment.  LANGF-E3-P2,61.175

There will branches enow spring out fresh to run upwards out of them
when they are so bowed.  LANGF-E3-P2,61.176

Lay none a-cross or under one another, LANGF-E3-P2,61.177

but let them spread as the fingers of your hand when it is expanded.
LANGF-E3-P2,61.178

Cut off such as grow directly outward close to the body;
LANGF-E3-P2,61.179

if you cut a part of any branch off, do it at the bud, that the cut may
be covered with a fresh sprig.  LANGF-E3-P2,61.180

The <font> Winter pruning <$$font> may be done as soon as the <font>
fruit <$$font>, and leaves are fallen, or any time before <font> February
<$$font>, except <font> Nectarines <$$font>, and <font> Peaches <$$font>,
which are apt to die, if prun'd before the Sap raise.  LANGF-E3-P2,61.181

Mr. <font> Rea <$$font> saith, the best time to Prune them,
is after they flower.  LANGF-E3-P2,61.182

<P_62>

Shreads of Wollen Cloth are the best things to Nail them up with;
LANGF-E3-P2,62.184

some use gentle Leather, or an old Hat, LANGF-E3-P2,62.185

any of these may serve turn.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.186

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.187

Sometime in the Winter, after <font> two <$$font> or <font> three <$$font>
years, if the <font> Soil <$$font> the <font> roots <$$font> are to spread
into, be not <font> rich <$$font> enough, open the ground at the outside
of the <font> holes <$$font> you made at setting, as near round about,
as the Wall will permit.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.188

If you find no roots bare, let it lye open a month, LANGF-E3-P2,62.189

and then fill it up with the Earth that came forth, well mixt with such
a <font> manure <$$font> as suits with it.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.190

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.191

Where the natural <font> soil <$$font> is not good enough of it self,
whether it be in <font> Garden, Orchard <$$font>, or <font> Field
<$$font>, there it ought to be by skill assisted, and better'd, at
least-wise for such a compass as the <font> roots <$$font> of every
Tree take up for some time, if not so far round as they are ever like
to extend themselves.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.192

And this must be done by mixing such <font> Manures <$$font> with the
<font> Soil <$$font>, as suit best with its temper.  LANGF-E3-P2,62.193

If the <font> Soil <$$font> be <font> clay <$$font>, or <font> clay
<$$font> mixt with <font> gravel <$$font>, or <font> wet heavy Land,
hot Dung <$$font>, as that of <font> Horses <$$font>, or <font> Poultry
<$$font>, is best to mix with it, to bring it to a due temperament.
LANGF-E3-P2,62.194

<P_63>

And if the <font> soil <$$font> be a <font> light, hollow, eskie <$$font>,
or <font> sandy land <$$font>, then <font> Marl, Mud <$$font> out of
a Pond or River, or <font> shovellings <$$font> of <font> dirty yards
<$$font> or <font> high-ways <$$font>, if they be not <font> sandy
<$$font>, and be well <font> mellowed <$$font>, by lying on heaps, and
especially if those heaps are mixed with Lime, are proper to mend it.
LANGF-E3-P2,63.196

If this last <font> soil <$$font> be <font> barren <$$font> likewise
, you may properly add a mixture of <font> Neats-dung <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,63.197

If your Land be too rich <paren> which is seldom seen <$$paren> you may
mix Gravel or cold clay with it.  LANGF-E3-P2,63.198

I have seen an <font> Apple-tree <$$font> on a <font> Hemp-but <$$font>
, which was constantly Plowed, and Manur'd to a great richness, bear more
<font> Apples <$$font> than four such Trees in an <font> Orchard <$$font>
would do.  LANGF-E3-P2,63.199

And $it $'s {TEXT:it's} constantly seen in <font> barren hungry Land
<$$font>, Trees thrive poorly, grow <font> Mossey <$$font>, or <font>
Bark-bound <$$font>, bearing very little, and that a very poor <font>
Fruit <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,63.200

Only <font> Wallnut-trees <$$font> and <font> Pear-trees <$$font> , do not
necessarily require a very <font> rich ground <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,63.201

and will prosper best on stony and light Land.  LANGF-E3-P2,63.202

<font> Sect. <$$font> 7.  LANGF-E3-P2,63.203

When your <font> Wall-trees <$$font> are grown old, and full of big Wood ,
you may in three or four years time renew them, by cutting out some of
the biggest <font> stems <$$font>, or <font> boughs <$$font>, yearly;
cutting <P_64> each branch off at some small twig, <paren> if it may
be <$$paren> that either it, or a fresh branch $may {TEXT:my} grow over
the cut place; which must be kept covered with Clay; LANGF-E3-P2,64.204

and so go on yearly, till all the big wood is cut out.  LANGF-E3-P2,64.205

Or if you dislike the kind of <font> Fruit <$$font>, you may <font>
Inoculate <$$font>, or <font> Graff <$$font> the boughs with a better
sort of <font> Fruit <$$font>, but not all in one year, but some one,
and some another.  LANGF-E3-P2,64.206

By either of these ways, you may renew a decaying Tree, and keep your
<font> Wall <$$font> almost still furnished, with less trouble and
charge, or loss of time than by taking up the old one, and <font>
planting <$$font> a young one in its stead.  LANGF-E3-P2,64.207

If the <font> Tree <$$font> be so old, that you resolve to take it up,
and plant another in its place, if you have none ready, nor are willing to
buy, the speediest way to be supplyed, you may find directed in Chapter
the first, Section the Ninth.  LANGF-E3-P2,64.208

<font> Sect. <$$font> 8.  LANGF-E3-P2,64.209

IN furnishing your <font> Walls <$$font> with <font> Fruit-trees <$$font>
, observe always to Plant <font> Peaches <$$font> and <font> Nectarines
<$$font> up to the <font> Wall <$$font> that is most <font> South-ward
<$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,64.210

the <font> East-Wall <$$font> is to be allotted to <font> Apricocks
<$$font>, early <font> Cherries <$$font>, and the choicest <font> Plums
<$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,64.211

the <font> West <$$font> may be set with <font> Pears, Cherries <$$font>
, and <font> Plums <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,64.212

<P_65>

Some of the coursest <font> Pears <$$font> and <font> Plums <$$font>,
you may set to the <font> North-Wall <$$font>, both to cover the <font>
Wall <$$font> handsomely, LANGF-E3-P2,65.214

and many years they will bear as well on it, as on <font> standards
<$$font>; especially if your <font> wall <$$font> stand not directly
<font> North <$$font>, but so as to have some considerable benefit of
the Sun; LANGF-E3-P2,65.215

<font> Nut-trees <$$font> likewise are proper for this <font> wall
<$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,65.216

and will prosper well up to it.  LANGF-E3-P2,65.217

For those Autumnal and winter <font> Pears <$$font>, that ripen late,
the most <font> South <$$font> and highest wall, doth improve them,
LANGF-E3-P2,65.218

and they deserve it, LANGF-E3-P2,65.219

neither will some come to maturity in our Climate <paren> some years
<$$paren> without such a wall.  LANGF-E3-P2,65.220

I would willingly bestow the best place I had upon one <font>
Winter-Boncreisten <$$font>, two <font> Buryes <$$font> or <font> Butter
Pears <$$font>, two <font> Virgulees <$$font>, and two <font> Chasseryes
<$$font>, a St. <font> Germans <$$font>, St. <font> Michael
<$$font>, the <font> Crasson <$$font>, the <font> Bon-Gerson <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,65.221

If your conveniencies will allow it, and you are to build a new <font>
Wall <$$font>, it is much better to have your <font> Garden walls
<$$font> not to stand directly towards the <font> four points <$$font>
, than otherwise, LANGF-E3-P2,65.222

and then the worst wall will be much better, and the best good enough
for your purpose.  LANGF-E3-P2,65.223

<P_66>

As thus, the <font> East-wall <$$font>, to incline to the <font> South
<$$font>; the <font> South <$$font>, to the <font> West <$$font>; the
<font> west <$$font>, to the <font> North <$$font>; the <font> North
<$$font> to the <font> East <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,66.225

or contrary, but not so well.  LANGF-E3-P2,66.226

In the first way the two first walls will be extraordinary good,
and the two latter good enough for ordinary <font> Fruit <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,66.227

<font> Sect. <$$font> 9.  LANGF-E3-P2,66.228

In building a new Wall, it would be very advantageous, to make it with
half rounds, each semi-circle being eight yards round in the inside,
and about six yards in the face or diameter, each taking two Trees;
LANGF-E3-P2,66.229

and betwixt every half round, let there be two foot breadth of plain
walling, where you may place a <font> Flower-pot <$$font> on a <font>
pillar two foot <$$font> high, or Plant a <font> Vine <$$font> to run
up it, which every Summer, you may let spread it self a little into the
<font> half rounds <$$font> on each side it.  LANGF-E3-P2,66.230

I know an honourable Gentleman, in somewhat a cold Country, that hath
his Garden walls so made, LANGF-E3-P2,66.231

and his Trees bear Fruit plentifully in such years as his neighbours
generally fail.  LANGF-E3-P2,66.232

I also saw a <font> wall <$$font> made thus for raising <font> Melons
<$$font> under, by a pattern or directions from <font> Italy <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,66.233

<P_67>

I have also seen <font> Grapes <$$font> ripen delicately on every side
the <font> cluster <$$font>, that grew in a <font> half round <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,67.235

By means of these <font> rounds <$$font>, every <font> wall <$$font> will
one time of the day or other, have a share of the Sun, LANGF-E3-P2,67.236

and the best <font> walls <$$font> <paren> by reason of such a reflection
, and collection of the Sun-beams as will be in every <font> round
<$$font> <$$paren> will be exceeding hot, LANGF-E3-P2,67.237

and the <font> Trees <$$font> be more secure from winds.
LANGF-E3-P2,67.238

Having said thus much here of the <font> Wall <$$font> that <font> Fruit
trees <$$font> are to be set up to, thus much more may not improperly be
here added.  That a <font> Pale <$$font> is as good for this purpose,
and in respect of ripening <font> Fruit <$$font> better than any thing
else it can be raised up to, if the <font> Pale <$$font> be made of
sawed boards, nine or ten foot high, and exactly joined, that no wind
may come through: LANGF-E3-P2,67.239

Next to this in goodness is a <font> Brick-wall <$$font>, and then a
<font> Stone-wall <$$font>, and the worst of all that which is made of
<font> Timber <$$font> and <font> Mortar <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,67.240

but in this every one $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be his own chooser,
LANGF-E3-P2,67.241

but must comply with what the <font> Country <$$font> he lives in will
permit him to do for his best convenience.  LANGF-E3-P2,67.242

When you <font> plant <$$font> your <font> Garden <$$font> with <font>
Fruit trees <$$font>, you may do well to draw <P_68> the <font> Platform
<$$font> of it in Paper, and so set down the name of every Tree, according
to the place it stands in, whether in <font> Wall-fruit <$$font> or <font>
Dwarf-trees <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,68.243

the same course you may use about your <font> Orchard <$$font>,
LANGF-E3-P2,68.244

and you will find it both satisfactory and useful, that you may readily
at any season of the year, know what kind of <font> Fruit <$$font>
every Tree beareth: LANGF-E3-P2,68.245

The <font> Fruit <$$font> planted in <font> Fields <$$font>, not being
of so much variety, may be easily distinguished without this help.

CHAP. XI.  LANGF-E3-P2,68.248

<font> Concerning Dwarf-Trees.  LANGF-E3-P2,68.249

<$$heading>

Sect. <$$font> 1.  LANGF-E3-P2,68.251

These <font> Trees <$$font> have been of late much affected and coveted,
because they are of special advantage for Table-fruit, <paren> whether
{for} <font> Pears, Apples, Plums <$$font> <paren> {COM:sic} or <font>
Cherries <$$font> <$$paren> being but of low Stature, LANGF-E3-P2,68.252

and may be <font> planted <$$font> in the <font> borders <$$font> of
<font> Garden-walks <$$font>, without doing any thing else there about
them any prejudice, by overshadowing them; LANGF-E3-P2,68.253

and their <font> fruit <$$font> will be as well secured, and
<P_69> commodious for gathering as the <font> Wall-fruit <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,69.254

<font> Sect. <$$font> 2.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.255

<font> Plants <$$font> for this purpose must be provided, and prepared
somewhat differently from those for <font> Orchards <$$font>, or <font>
Fields <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.256

The <font> Quince-tree <$$font> is generally used, and best for <font>
Stocks for <font> Pears <$$font>, both for <font> Dwarfs <$$font> and
<font> Wall <$$font>; as well because it may possibly somewhat meliorate
the <font> Pear <$$font> as <paren> and that chiefly <$$paren> because
it groweth not to that bigness, as on a <font> Pear-stock <$$font>
it would be apt to do.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.257

<font> Sect. <$$font> 3.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.258

For <font> Dwarf-Apple-trees <$$font> the best <font> Stocks <$$font>
are such as are raised of the <font> cuttings <$$font> of other <font>
Apple-trees <$$font>, as of the <font> Gennet-moil <$$font>, the <font>
Kentish-Codling <$$font> and others.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.259

That these are more proper for <font> Dwarf-trees <$$font>, than <font>
Crab-stocks <$$font>, appears; 1. Because the <font> Fruit <$$font>
will be rather better'd, and not tainted with any asperity, or roughnesse,
as possibly it might be, if <font> Crab tree-stocks <$$font> were made
use of; LANGF-E3-P2,69.260

and one chief design in these <font> Trees <$$font> is to have choice
and delicious Fruit for eating.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.261

2.  LANGF-E3-P2,69.262

<font> Apple-trees <$$font> that are raised on such <font> Stocks
<$$font>, will not grow so big as those on <font> Crab-stocks <$$font>
, LANGF-E3-P2,69.263

but are with ease and certainty kept <font> Dwarfs <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,69.264

Mr. <font> Rea <$$font> judging <P_70> the <font> Paradise-Apple
<$$font> of somewhat slow growth in bringing forward a <font> Scion
<$$font>, advises to <font> graff <$$font> a <font> Paradise <$$font>
on a <font> Crab-stock <$$font>, and the <font> Fruit <$$font> you would
have, on that <font> Paradise <$$font>, that the <font> Crab <$$font>
might yield plenty of <font> juice <$$font> or <font> sap <$$font> to
the <font> Paradise <$$font>, and the <font> Paradise <$$font> retard
the growth of the <font> Apple planted <$$font> on it, so as to keep it
a <font> Dwarf <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,70.265

but besides loss of time, I doubt the success of this, because the <font>
Crab <$$font> will put forth strong Root; and yield plenty of nourishment:
LANGF-E3-P2,70.266

For why <font> Apple-trees <$$font> raised by <font> cuttings <$$font>
grow not to be very large Trees, I take to be, their putting forth
such small <font> Roots <$$font>, by which means the Tree hath <font>
sap <$$font> conveyed to it accordingly.  LANGF-E3-P2,70.267

3.  LANGF-E3-P2,70.268

By using these <font> cuttings <$$font> for <font> Stocks <$$font> ,
you shall get at least four years time, reckoning from sowing the <font>
Crab-kernel <$$font>, and the setting the <font> Stem <$$font> or <font>
Cutting <$$font>, being duly ordered; As, 1. By setting the <font>
Stem <$$font> in the place you intend the <font> Dwarf-tree <$$font>
shal grow.  2. And setting it in good Earth , LANGF-E3-P2,70.269

for then after one years growth you may <font> Graff <$$font> it,
LANGF-E3-P2,70.270

and you will easily discern the advantage in point of time.
LANGF-E3-P2,70.271

<P_71>

If it be said <font> Crab-stocks <$$font> ready grown may be made
use of instead of <font> cuttings <$$font>; $there $'s {TEXT:there's}
this Answer ready, They must grow <font> two <$$font> if not <font>
three <$$font> years after they are set before they are fit to <font>
graff <$$font>, and in respect of their large growth will not be fit
for <font> Dwarfs <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,71.273

Some <font> Nursery Men <$$font> have made advantage to themselves
by this speedy way of raising Trees by <font> Cuttings <$$font>,
LANGF-E3-P2,71.274

but to the disadvantage of them they put them off for <font> planting
<$$font> in <font> Orchards <$$font>, because they are never like to
make large, or long lasting Trees.  LANGF-E3-P2,71.275

<font> Sect. <$$font> 4.  LANGF-E3-P2,71.276

The way then to provide these <font> Stocks <$$font> is thus:
LANGF-E3-P2,71.277

In <font> October <$$font> from such <font> Trees <$$font> whose <font>
cuttings <$$font> will grow, take such <font> stems <$$font>, or <font>
branches <$$font> that grow straightest, and which <paren> in the place
where they shall be <font> graffed <$$font> <$$paren> are an <font>
inch <$$font> or more thick, LANGF-E3-P2,71.278

if they be near <font> two inches <$$font> $it $'s {TEXT:it's} so much
the better; LANGF-E3-P2,71.279

cut them off, if you can, a hands breadth below such <font> knots <$$font>
or <font> burrs <$$font> as are on them, LANGF-E3-P2,71.280

for at those <font> burs <$$font> they principally put forth their <font>
Roots <$$font> <$$paren> {COM:no_matching_open_paren} LANGF-E3-P2,71.281

and cut off the top, that they be not above a yard long,
LANGF-E3-P2,71.282

if you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} get them so long of <font> Quinces <$$font>
<$$paren> {COM:no_matching_open_paren} you must be content with shorter
, LANGF-E3-P2,71.283

<paren> if they be <font> two foot <$$font> it may do <P_72> reasonably
well {COM:no_matching_close_paren}: LANGF-E3-P2,72.284

Cut off also all side <font> branches <$$font> close to the body,
except one small twigg near the top, for the Sap to vent it self at,
LANGF-E3-P2,72.285

set these presently in <font> beds <$$font> as your <font> Seed-plants
<$$font> were, LANGF-E3-P2,72.286

or rather if your <font> Garden <$$font> be laid out <paren> that
you can know the places they shall stand in <$$paren> set them there.
LANGF-E3-P2,72.287

You need not fear setting these as deep, as the length will bear, so
that there be about a <font> foot <$$font> above ground, because they
will shoot out <font> roots <$$font> all along, almost to the top of
the ground, and to spread their <font> roots <$$font> in the good Soil ;
LANGF-E3-P2,72.288

and by setting them something deep they are in less danger of dying,
LANGF-E3-P2,72.289

and this prevents the trouble of covering the ground about them with
<font> Fearn <$$font> or <font> Straw <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,72.290

and by this means likewise they will stand the firmer in the loose
<font> Garden-land <$$font>, for <font> graffing <$$font> at a years
end, and better support a <font> spreading top <$$font> afterwards.
LANGF-E3-P2,72.291

<font> Sect. <$$font> 5.  LANGF-E3-P2,72.292

But because $it $'s {TEXT:it's} hard to meet with great plenty of such
<font> branches <$$font>, thus to be cut, and set for <font> stocks
<$$font>, that have <font> burrs <$$font> or <font> knots <$$font> upon
them; <font> Planters <$$font> have therefore found out a way <paren>
which is called <font> Circumposition <$$font> <$$paren> to bring these
<font> knots <$$font> or <font> burrs <$$font> upon <font> Branches
<$$font>, that had them not before, and to mend and improve those that
before had them, LANGF-E3-P2,72.293

and the way of it is as followeth.  LANGF-E3-P2,72.294

<P_73>

About the beginning of <font> February <$$font> next before you design to
cut these <font> stems <$$font>, directly above the place you intend to
cut them off at, for about a <font> foot <$$font> in length, fasten about
them some Earth in an <font> old Hat <$$font>, or <font> Boot <$$font>,
or <font> Bag <$$font>, made of some strong Cloth: And in that Earth they
will have put forth Roots against the <font> October <$$font> following,
when you are to cut them off to set them.  LANGF-E3-P2,73.296

Or <paren> which is a quicker and readier way <$$paren> you may dawb
some <font> wet Earth <$$font> or <font> Clay <$$font> about the place
, and wrap a <font> Hay-band <$$font> about it, putting some moist
Earth likewise betwixt the <font> rounds <$$font> of the band, and then
running it about again over the spaces betwixt those first <font> rounds
<$$font> of the <font> Hay-band <$$font> and making fast the ends of it.
LANGF-E3-P2,73.297

If the <font> stem <$$font> have no <font> burr <$$font> before you go
either of these ways to work, LANGF-E3-P2,73.298

then first take off here and there a little <font> slice <$$font> of
<font> Bark <$$font> about an <font> inch <$$font> long round about
it near the middle of the place to be covered as hath been directed.
LANGF-E3-P2,73.299

Some direct, That before this application of the Earth, about an <font>
inch <$$font> breadth of the <font> Bark <$$font> be taken off, round
about the part of the <font> branch <$$font>, that is to be surrounded
with the Earth, that <font> roots <$$font> may shoot out in greater
quantity, by coming <P_74> out in the upper <font> skirts <$$font> of
that <font> circle <$$font>, as well as in the lower; LANGF-E3-P2,74.300

but this is but a Crotchet, and grounded <paren> as my Lord <font> Bacon
<$$font> hath truly observed <$$paren> upon the opinion of the <font>
Descension <$$font> of the <font> Sap <$$font>; whereas indeed there is
no such thing, LANGF-E3-P2,74.301

for the whole mass of <font> Sap <$$font> is always ascending; in lesser
quantity in the Winter, because the Tree is then only to be nourished
, and kept alive, to which end a small supply is sufficient, and yet
necessary; and in greater plenty than {COM:sic} the Summer, to furnish
the Tree with leaves, fruit, and new yearly growth.  LANGF-E3-P2,74.302

And the true reason why the <font> leaves <$$font> and <font> fruit
<$$font> fall off towards Winter is, not because the <font> sap <$$font>
returns downward from them, but because they have arrived to their full
ripeness, and the Tree fails by degrees, to convey up so much Sap as it
did in the Summer to them, to produce fresh ones; LANGF-E3-P2,74.303

and therefore consequently $that $'s {TEXT:that's} an idle mistake
too, to think that the <font> sap <$$font> or <font> juice <$$font>
in the Winter, is laid up in the Roots as a <font> repository <$$font>,
as appears plainly, inasmuch as they are ever found dryer in the Winter
than in the Summer.  So that upon the whole, this taking the <font> Bark
<$$font> off round the <font> branch <$$font>, is good for nothing ,
but to endanger it, by intercepting <P_75> the <font> juice <$$font> or
<font> sap <$$font>, which rises in greatest quantity betwixt the <font>
bark <$$font> and the <font> wood <$$font>; LANGF-E3-P2,75.304

but if, as before was hinted, you take some little <font> slices <$$font>
of the <font> bark <$$font> off round the <font> branch <$$font> , here
and there, leaving the Bark intire in some places, this may, by checking
the Sap, cause it the more abundantly to pass into <font> Roots <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,75.305

But to proceed to the business in hand, you have seen the way of
preparing <font> cuttings <$$font> by <font> circumposition <$$font>
, LANGF-E3-P2,75.306

and though some will pretend to raise Trees of any kind by the use of
it, yet $it $'s {TEXT:it's} certain it avails not, but only in such
as by a peculiar property are apt to put forth <font> Roots <$$font>,
being cut off and set into the ground; LANGF-E3-P2,75.307

and, those generally known, and made use of this way, are the <font>
Kentish-Codling <$$font>, the <font> Gennet-moil <$$font>, some sorts
of <font> Sweet-Apples <$$font>, and <font> Bitter-sweets <$$font>,
the <font> Quince-tree <$$font>, the <font> Mulberry-tree <$$font>, and
the <font> Paradise-Apple-tree <$$font>; which last is much commended
by the skilful Mr. <font> Rea <$$font>, for to raise <font>
Stocks <$$font> for <font> Dwarf-Apple-trees <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,75.308

<font> Sect. <$$font> 6.  LANGF-E3-P2,75.309

Another way to raise <font> Stocks <$$font> for <font> Dwarf trees
<$$font>, is to cut down some one Tree of little worth, of such a kind
as you want <font> Stocks <$$font> of about a <font> foot <$$font>,
or more from the ground: LANGF-E3-P2,75.310

This will make some kind of Trees very apt to cast forth <P_76> very
good <font> Suckers <$$font> from the old <font> Roots <$$font>;
LANGF-E3-P2,76.311

such as are two years growth may be <font> transplanted <$$font>
, or <font> inoculated <$$font> where they stand before removal;
LANGF-E3-P2,76.312

and the Stump above ground, will also put forth abundance of young Shoots.
LANGF-E3-P2,76.313

After these young <font> shoots <$$font> have grown out of the stump one
year, cast <font> Mold <$$font>, or <font> Earth <$$font> about them,
a good height; so that you cover not the <font> tops <$$font> of any of
them; where let them grow two years more, and they will be well rooted,
LANGF-E3-P2,76.314

then cut them off from the old <font> Stock <$$font>, <paren> which
after that may yield fresh ones again <$$paren> LANGF-E3-P2,76.315

and set the <font> shoots <$$font> you take off as before hath been
directed about Cuttings.  LANGF-E3-P2,76.316

These will be about three years longer before they be ready to <font>
graff <$$font> than <font> Cuttings <$$font>, LANGF-E3-P2,76.317

but will be very good young fresh <font> Stocks <$$font>,
LANGF-E3-P2,76.318

and is a good way to raise <font> Stocks <$$font> of the <font>
Quince-tree <$$font> for <font> Pears <$$font>; because <font>
Quince-trees <$$font> generally grow so crooked and irregular, that $it
$'s {TEXT:it's} difficult to procure any considerable quantity of them
by <font> Cuttings <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,76.319

You may gain time in raising <font> Trees <$$font> this way if you
inoculate these young <font> suckers <$$font> or <font> shoots <$$font>
where they stand, as soon as they are big enough, and let them continue
<P_77> there to make one years growth; by which time they will be well
rooted, and ready to remove.  LANGF-E3-P2,77.320

If they shoot up tall after they are molded, you had best top them at
a convenient height, LANGF-E3-P2,77.321

it will make them grow the more in bigness, and so be sooner fit to <font>
graff <$$font>.  LANGF-E3-P2,77.322

But if you have a desire to have any of the same kind as {of} the old
Tree was, you need not top them.  LANGF-E3-P2,77.323

And by this means if you want <font> Quince-trees, Codlings <$$font>
, &c. you may be furnished with plenty, that will make better
and handsomer Trees than if you raise them by <font> Cuttings <$$font>.
LANGF-E3-P2,77.324
