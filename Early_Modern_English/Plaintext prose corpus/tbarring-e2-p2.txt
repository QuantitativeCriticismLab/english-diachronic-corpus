Madame This short time of distance since I was with you hath produced
nothing either new or worthy of your eye, TBARRING-E2-P2,124.3

only the greate affaire of the King's Bench is to morrow to be tryed
between the king and our parliament men.  TBARRING-E2-P2,124.4

The time is fixt, TBARRING-E2-P2,124.5

God send such an issue as may most gloryfye him and benefitt king and
subjects.  TBARRING-E2-P2,124.6

This day my cozen Dunch maryes his brave mistress, a gentle-woman of
portion, education and proportion paralel to his estate and credit
sufficient for his long delayed matrimonye.  TBARRING-E2-P2,124.7

My wife and my selfe are solemnely invited to morrow to be thare when
is the festivall, this day not allowing it, and the joyneing of hands
being alltogether private.  TBARRING-E2-P2,124.8

Madame my intention and desyre is to see you againe before my jornye
to Hatfeild <paren> if I can find any time from my busynes <$$paren>
haveing had so little libertye by reson of my lord to discourse with you
of diverse particulars which I resolved to impart to you, som of mirth,
som for meear notice, som of <paren> though small <$$paren> busines.
TBARRING-E2-P2,124.9

My wife tenders her dewtye and service to you, desyring your excuse for
her not waiteing on you haveing no horses of her owne and being so lately
perplext with those hyred, as Tobie knowes.  TBARRING-E2-P2,124.10

Owr love to all our freinds, TBARRING-E2-P2,124.11

Madame This toune is so barren of newes, as if the frost $had foreclosed
the streame.  TBARRING-E2-P2,133.16

The only intelligence I can derive to yow is the French king hath
advaunced his foote forces to Piamont and the cardinall demaunds high
conditions in his behalfe thare.  TBARRING-E2-P2,133.17

His naval power is in dayly preparation, he haveing dessigned 30,000
crounes by the yeear to fortyfye him selfe at sea, TBARRING-E2-P2,133.18

and towards the effecting heearof hath procured 20 or 30 familyes of
the best shipp wrights that <P_134> he can obtaine into his countrye.
TBARRING-E2-P2,134.19

Besydes this, he finding that the only way to improove his strength for
the seas is to take of that contempt which the nobless of Fraunce held
formerly all marchandizeing in <paren> that so the publique of the better
condition applying them selves to trafique might necessaryly add increase
to his kingdom in shipping <$$paren>, he hath him selfe immediately
professed that he will trade at sea as a marchant TBARRING-E2-P2,134.20

and hath innobled thareby that qualytye TBARRING-E2-P2,134.21

and will no question in probabilytye be much more powerfull at sea,
of which the French embassador knowes TBARRING-E2-P2,134.22

for he allready professes against owr king's sole regalytye on the
narrow seas, or his master his rayseinge sayle to our king's shipps.
TBARRING-E2-P2,134.23

But his indevors have not yet raysed his ambition high enough <paren>
as all men thinke <$$paren> to attempt us with a bodye of a navye,
TBARRING-E2-P2,134.24

yet God open the eyes of state to foresee the perill of this groeing
evell.  TBARRING-E2-P2,134.25

And so with my humble dewtye and my wive's I rest Your most obedient
and loving sonn Thomas Barrington TBARRING-E2-P2,134.26

{COM:f.109b} Madame, my wife is so unwilling and carefull not to
intermedle with or dispose of what is yours that she will not be
perswaded to make your old peuter new $withoute {COM:with_oute} your
consent, which being graunted it shall be the same in nomber and waight
; TBARRING-E2-P2,134.27

the charge will be myne as well as the comodiousnes, now especially when
we expect som freinds of worth before Easter.  TBARRING-E2-P2,134.28

I desyre your answar to this resonable request for my wive's satisfaction
.  TBARRING-E2-P2,134.29

Theise be delivered to the honourable my verye good mother the Lady
Johan Barrington at Harrow TBARRING-E2-P2,134.30
