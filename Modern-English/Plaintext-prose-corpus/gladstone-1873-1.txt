Jan 2.  1873.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.4

1.  I telegraph to you this forenoon my assent to the rather absurd
surtaxe d'entrepo`t.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.5

2.  Yesterday I sent you a private letter which Elliot had written to
me about the Bulgarian Schism.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.6

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help fearing that that schism may become a
source of political danger as it will bring in Russia to meddle in the
religious concerns of the Turkish Empire under the plea of ecclesiastical
communion.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.7

Being thus <P_2,369> dangerous it is also if I am rightly informed a
quarrel without any fair ground of difference; as I understand that the
Patriarch of Constantinople who was wrong at the outset has been willing
for some time to grant the Bulgarians their independence of his ordinary
jurisdiction, but asks some territorial delimitation of the Bulgarian
Church & its inmunities.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.8

If this be the case the demand is so reasonable that I am at a loss to
conceive how it could be evaded: GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.9

on its being granted, or agreed to be granted, the excommunication ought
to be rescinded & peace re-established.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.10

Sir H. Elliot's language & conduct seem to me most reasonable.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.11

An attempt at an accommodation may be regarded as lying beyond his
ordinary attributions.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.12

But I wish something could be done.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.13

3.  I have read your letter to Paget about Borneo & the Italian Prison
proposed to be founded there.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.14

I am rather behindhand in my information GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.15

but I did not know that we had properly speaking territorial rights
in Borneo.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.16

The plan may be bad GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.17

but if they think it good it would seem that <font> somewhere
<$$font> they ought to be able to do that which France & for all I
know other countries are still doing, & which we in my opinion were
obliged to abandon only because we had so ludicrously overdone it.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.18

In the inclosed tract, sent to me by Sir E. Freshfield,
you will find an interesting account of the Bulgarian affair.

Jan 3.  73.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.23

I think Kennedy's references home in the matter of French Treaty are
either a little over or a little underdone.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.24

This morning I had a draft about woollen duties with a request
to reply'approve'or'wait'while the box is marked'Pressing'.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.25

In the explanatory paper I find no material whereupon to found a real
judgment.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.26

It seems to me that where he and the Delegates from the Chambers are
agreed he may safely proceed - & that where they are not agreed the
<font> degree {TEXT:missing_comma} nature <$$font> and <font> reasons
<$$font> of the difference between them should be clearly stated &
that reference without this is little better than futile in matters
which are not of policy or principle but of the purest technical detail.

You will see that he has in some degree relapsed.

, to let us know generally what line he would suggest our taking about

Ja 3.  73.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.35

1.  Audience question with China.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.36

I have read much about its postponement or its acceleration, & about
what we or others should do on it; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.37

but I never recollect to have read a reasoned statement of the merits
of the case <font> pro <$$font> & <font> con <$$font>, and especially
of the arguments which are or might be made by the Chinese against it.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.38

The very first thing for us to do I think is to get this.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.39

The question is not one of the self-evident class
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.40

and among other things may be borne in mind - a.  That the dignity of
Foreign Powers may be impaired rather than promoted, if the forms of
presentation should assume a certain character.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.41

I observe that prostration is contemplated by Mr Wade as a part of them.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.42

b.  Considering that this matter seems to be regarded as a first class
question in China, I rather hesitate to agree to Mr Wade's demand that
we should decide simply whether the audience is to be pressed for,
and leave the manner to the joint action of the Ministers there.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.43

Mr Wade himself deserves much confidence I believe,
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.44

but as to the diplomatic corps at Pekin I am not so sure.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.45

b {COM:sic}.  The danger of being tripped up by the Russians is I
think grave.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.46

If they have a territorial question alive with China in all likelihood
it is much more important to <font> them <$$font> than this matter of
the Audience, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.47

and they will work accordingly, and <font> sell <$$font> the common
demand for the particular advantage of which they are in quest.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.48

c.  Mr Wade describes the matter as urgent GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.49

but I do not see why - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.50

We surely have very little to complain of as a nation in the conduct of
the Chinese through a series of years.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.51

It is not the practical conduct of business that seems to be in question
but some sort of symbolic manifestation.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.52

This surely will bear at least the lapse of time sufficient to let us
know what is to be pressed for, & why.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.53

In conclusion I must say that I do not quite appreciate the frightful
grievance that all these diplomatists appear to have suffered in having
the announcement of the Marriage conveyed to them <font> together <$$font>
with the request that foreigners should not come into the line of the
procession.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.54

It <font> may <$$font> have been wrong: GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.55

but for all I can see there might have been a counter-grievance, if the
marriage had been announced & the intimation reserved for a separate
and subsequent communication when the Chinese might have been told they
had forfeited their right to restrict the free movement of foreigners
by not exercising it at the proper time.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.56

I am sorry to miss him.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,371.62

3.  I hope measure will be observed in talking about the poor Emperor's
fidelity to England.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.65

It was a matter of policy; and of feeling subordinate to policy.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.66

<font> How <$$font> subordinate it was we had proofs enough; most of
all the Benedetti business, which no one wished to bring into the notice
it deserved, and of the disgrace of which certainly France & I presume
therefore Napoleon bears much more than half.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.67

4.  Those interesting but most sad letters from Spain suggest one or
two observations.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.68

They are strangely unfortunate in having to bring in so to
speak their Puerto Rico Bill & then adjourn for three weeks.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.69

In this country, when matters were in our small way critical,
we should regard this as certain death to a measure & a ministry.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.70

Again what can be more left-handed than to provide that the emancipation
shall take place at a certain time <font> after <$$font> an event of which
they may not be masters viz. publication in the Island Gazette.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.71

1.  With regard to Ld O. Russell's letter on the $anti-English
{TEXT:anti_English} feeling at Berlin.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.79

He seems to found it on the preposterous charge about Arms, in which it
seems they think they have a case.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.80

Why should we not invite a general conference of nations, either including
America or without her if she would not sit to discuss the question
without prejudice - to have submitted to it the cases in which during
the recent wars complaints have been made as to the supply of arms
and to inquire whether any impediment ought to be placed in its way.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.81

I do not see that inconvenience could well arise from such an
international commission so to call it, while there would I should think
be decided advantage in our proposing it, if the Cabinet thought fit.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.82

2.  I read Gen. Walker's report inclosed in the Dispatch
with greater interest than any one I have ever seen from him.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.83

Of course it will go to Cardwell.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.84

I have always understood that our Staff Arrangements and Appointments
were by far the most expensive in the world.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.85

Lowe told me the other day he found there were three Colonels over
Netley Hospital!  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.86

As to details Cardwell has been a great <P_2,373> deal too much &
too well employed in great matters to be responsible for all that was
done in the strange business called our Army reorganisation in 1855 &
the subsequent years.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.87

I can hardly suppose General Walker right in his facts:
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.88

if he were so it would be a sad disgrace to us.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.89

As to the German invasion it would pull down that nation very much, at
least in my opinion, if they thought of it as a practical or practicable
business except in the case of some combination of all Europe against
us which is not an easy one to conceive.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.90

But they are quite right to include our little country in their exercises.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.91

I dare say it will not make you very nervous if some energetic pupil
demonstrates the mode in which even Walmer Castle might be taken.

I do not quite gather from your note received today or from the

GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.100

But this is not very material.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.101

The fact being so, I agree that the balance of reasons against any
attempt to interfere with it still subsists.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.102

Indeed it is strengthened by the fact that the Duke himself is now by
three or four years farther advanced into manhood so as to have passed
beyond those periods of life to which any thing like restraint except in
the form of advice is principally applicable.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.103

It is further strengthened, as far as appears, by the circumstance that
a <font> greater <$$font> amount of difficulty attends any other course
than was at the former period in full view.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.104

contemplation should take effect; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.105

There are two points on which I should like to have full information

1.  How far does the position of France as co-Guarantor of the Sultan's
independence affect our right of sole coercive interference in Zanzibar.

2.  What does Sir B. Frere propose to do with regard to ships
suspected of carrying slaves but carrying the flags of countries which
have not conceded to us the right of search?  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,382.208

If there be a question of an instruction to Jervoise about the place

it to his recommending, as far as he can, that it be held in Rome.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,383.227

One step farther it might be right for him to go, but only I think
after we have fully considered it - namely to point out the difficulty

This note embodies a request made to me orally by Ld R. Grosvenor.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.263

There seems to be a little mixture of the two questions 1.  How far
new means of communication are desirable.  2.  How far we are to
give an opinion as between this & other modes of providing them.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.264

On the second question it is for us to say as little as possible.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.265

Still it occurs to me that the Tunnel is free from an objection to
the Ferry plan viz. that it might give an excuse for a great
naval harbour on the French side at the narrowest point of the Channel.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.266

But on the first question I suppose we really while renouncing all
interference regard with a friendly and lively interest all schemes
framed with this object and open to no just objection, which is the case
of the Tunnel.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.267

GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,391.342

I have just received, <font> on the rail, <$$font> your telegrams of
this morning: GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.425

but you will be clever if you catch me again before Balmoral.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.426

I imagined Spencer to have settled the matter rather more than he seems
to have thought GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.427

but am quite content either way.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.428

Only I think a change in the Secretaryship desirable.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.429

Ld Strafford's note is more flattering I fear than just:
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.430

I can only plead hard work towards deserving it.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.431

I am so glad of the good opinion of so consummate a judge about my
letters to Lowe.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.432

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} admit Hartington's right to be sore.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.433

There have been so many <font> obita dicta <$$font> to me, &,
as I learn, to Spencer, and not only to F. $Cavendish.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.434

A man has no right to put himself in the position of being able to say
"I gave you clearly enough to understand I should go"or at his choice
to say'my place was not vacant GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.435

& you had no right to think or speak of it to any one'.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.436

You will observe that I have only dealt with it contingently & have
given Forster no pledge whatever.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.437

Harrington has many good & fine qualities beside his birth:
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.438

but I am tempted to say he sells them rather dear.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.439

I earnestly hope he will not go, & especially will not go in a huff -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.440

I am <font> altogether taken by surprise.  <$$font>
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.441

I assure you I am not without the fear of Bright's bolting.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.442

I am past all matter of fear in a case like $Hartington's,
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.443

for I think the fate of the Govt will depend upon bigger things.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.444

But your letter has been of great use to me GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.445

Aug. 20.  73.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.451

1.  One thing I omitted to say yesterday in writing about Hartington -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.452

I feel he has been unjustly dealt with as to the G. P.
O. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.453

Monsell seems never to have bestowed a thought in this matter upon any
body but himself - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.454

and I considered that his return to the G. P. O.
<paren> which as I have told you I supposed would be otherwise agreeable
- & this explains the succinctness of my words in writing to him
<$$paren> would be the most emphatic assertion on our part at least
that he had been wholly free from blame in his administration there.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.455

Had I dreamed of his preference for the B. of W. I should
not have closed that door so speedily.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.456

2.  I have sent for the list of possible or intending Peers.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.457

I think your suggestion good.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.458

3.  I arrived this morning, in most brilliant clear cold.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.459

Ponsonby tells me <font> you <$$font> follow.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.460

On what day do you <paren> or the second man <$$paren> stand to arrive?
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.461

Many thanks for the inclosures.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.468

I do not see what you could have said more or better than you have said.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.469

We are in truth surprised all round.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.470

I will not discuss any question about complaint.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.471

The question is what is best to be done.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.472

Circular correspondences on these matters are difficult to conduct
satisfactorily to an issue.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.473

I think that the best way will be to let these matters lie over until
the October meeting and that this had better follow Oct. 1 as
closely as may be.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.474

I regret Bessborough's strong language about Cowper; and even more about
<P_2,400> Forster.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.475

Cowper's antecedents are certainly far better than those of Abercorn:
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.476

and to call Forster a gorilla simply shows unacquaintance with him, &
with the secret of his strength, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.477

for strength undoubtedly he has.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.478

It would be very unfortunate, & would indeed be a strong measure,
that Spencer & Hartington, if they go, should go at the same moment
like Siamese.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.479

If you agree about postponement perhaps you will work in that sense.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.480

In personal nearness there will at any rate be less risk of the rather
ridiculous misunderstandings which have marked this last series of
proceedings.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.481

My only desire in the matter is to act for the best.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.482

One would rather have anticipated a more sympathetic view?
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.486

GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.491

I sent your congratulations to the Queen.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.492

It does not appear that the swimmers <P_2,401> were exhausted:
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.493

but they seem to hint they were glad of assistance.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.494

The Queen evidently means him a jobation.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.495

The Queen is very desirous now that the $ex-Duke {TEXT:ex_Duke} of
Brunswick is dead that progress should if possible be made in the matter
of securing that succession to the son of the King of Hannover {COM:sic}
by way of compensation for the titular succession to his Father which
he would resign, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.496

Bismarck as the incarnation of evil seems to be the impediment, with
the Crown Prince and Princess behind him.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.497

It is a great misfortune if he is governed by a mania of centralisation
and absorption.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.498

The Queen is quite satisfied with Lord Odo about this matter.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.499

She is on the other hand afraid of her daughter's views in politics &
in religion.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.500

There may be some resemblance between this question in Germany, and that
of the native princes in India: where I for one am on the side of those
who wish not to absorb.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.501

Rothschild is one of the best I know, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.510

At the same time I know of no reason that would justify me in hesitating
to say at once that if his view is altered as to his resignation, I hope
he will stay.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,402.526

If I feel the delay till October to be desirable as to Hartington,
it is from no dissatisfaction, but because though unpledged there are
considerations of policy which may give that case a somewhat different
aspect.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,402.527

I do not see, after long conversations with the Queen, that it is
likely to present any insurmountable difficulty as to the substance,
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,404.567

but it raises a number of points which will require careful handling
both to clear the meaning & to set the expression right, besides some

Lowe's speech at Sheffield is really too bad, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.614

&, free as I believe it is from all evil intention, it illustrates the
incurable solecisms of his extraordinary mind.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.615

Also wholly untrue.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.622

In this duty I am sorry to say he was wretchedly deficient:

He has ample merit to stand on, in a great amount of patient labour
done, & generally well done & with good results, for the public.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.636

Much <P_2,408> of the unpopularity is unjust: GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.637

I am afraid this speech may provoke attack or criticism,

Sept 9.  73.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.644

I have thought it best to send through Hammond by wire a suggestion
which occurred to me that the conduct of the Spaniards in the case of the
Deerhound might afford us a fair plea for holding our hands in the case
of the Ironclads - & thus open a way of escape from a serious though I
hope a temporary difficulty.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.645

<font> Before <$$font> I got the facts about the Deerhound I had been
inclining to the following conclusions.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.646

1.  Loyalty <paren> <font> loyaute` <$$font> <$$paren> binds us to
restore the ships if the Spanish Govt is really able or presumably able
to receive them.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.647

2.  That being so it would be unworthy to be deterred by rebel threats
at Carthagena.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.648

<$$font> the British Naval force we can collect for the occasion.

I hope it was in time.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.677

The main points are the two first.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.678

1.  As to Peerages please to read Wolverton's letter within.

GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.680

of 15 miles of Railway for the contingency of our deciding to invade
South Africa.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.683

I had already stated the need of information about this business for
the Cabinet as well as myself - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.684

we have never had any I think except a few sentences <font> viva` voce.
<$$font> GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.685

And I have told Cardwell that if it be necessary to proceed in
this matter now, I do not feel able to do it without a Cabinet.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.686

At such a Cabinet Bright should if possible be present -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.687

and I <font> may <$$font> therefore have to ask you to get an
earlier day fixed for the Council than we had contemplated.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.688

3.  The Chancellor evidently took the right point about the Deerhound
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.689

but it is fortunate for us that the Spanish Government are so
unreasonable.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.690

offence.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.709

My view of him is I think the same as yours.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.710

There is every likelihood that he may yet have to pass from 10 to 20
years in the House of Commons; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.711

and his role there ought to be a very important one with his excellent

They do not include the Prime Minister's letter of concession.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.821

I think the great object for the moment should be to obtain time if
possible for a thorough examination.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.824

1.  Mr Wood's case is not fully before me.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.825

I do not know his character, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.826

& much depends upon this.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.827

Upon the surface, his language to the Bey savours as much of dictation
and pressure, as any thing we <font> know <$$font> of the French agents.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.828

2.  De Broglie alleges that he sought the concession originally for
himself.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.829

Is he now free from all pecuniary interest in the matter?
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.830

3.  The remonstrance is stated by the Bey of Tunis in his note to
have been addressed to him by the Consuls generally and the Traders of
the place.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.831

This statement from such a source tells strongly against peremptory

any claim might be founded.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.835

One point of difficulty seems to be the determination of the degree in
which the letter of the Prime Minister pledges the Government or rather
the Bey.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.837

I was not warmly for Baxter, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.850

but I do not quite understand W.s reasons against him.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.851

Your brother would certainly be the best Post Master General of the three:
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.852

& I think Baxter the next.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.853

So undoubtedly he would be a wiser $Under-Secretary {TEXT:Under_Secretary}
for the Colonies - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.854

but then he would not with his views be able to talk the Bunkum in which,
on that subject, the House too much delights.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.855

He would I am sure deliver very sound Ashantee & Gold Coast doctrine.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.856

2.  Chancing to hear from some authentic source an excellent
account of Erle's recovered health, I wrote to the Chancellor,
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.857

and I inclose his reply, which I interpret as meaning that E should now
be No 1 for the legal Peerage.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.858

Do you agree?  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.859

3.  Reading your Draft on the Three Rules moved me to put down in a short
memorandum what I have to say on the subject - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.860

It has reference to future stages of the matter.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,418.861

We expect to be at Althorp <paren> probably <$$paren> on the 6th.

Wolverton has set out the reasons <font> for <$$font> in the case of
Hugessen; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.869

I am sorry to say they do not at all satisfy me.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.870

1.  Nothing but <font> necessity <$$font> should lead us
to open a ministerial seat to which any doubt can attach.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.871

W. gives a favourable opinion but with"I think".
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.872

2.  The P. O. with its huge & growing estabt {COM:sic}
requires a real economist.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.873

I own I have never seen a sign of this in H.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.874

3.  He is a good fellow, a clever fellow, a very good speaker;
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.875

but he has the P. C. given him very lately -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.876

another step wd now be quite gratuitous, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.877

& he like Baxter has never earned a reputation as a hard worker.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.878

4.  A gratuitous promotion in his case is the more questionable
, because he very needlessly ran amuck at the Dissenters.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.879

5.  Two important appts are voided by a Scot & an Irishman -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.880

it is hardly desirable to make upon this two important appts both of
Englishmen.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.881

In or among these considerations I find more than enough reason for a
negative after thinking the matter over.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.882

I send a copy of them to Wn GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.883

& I telegraphed to you both this morning - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.884

I send his letter.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.885

Your cover which reached me today covered two letters dated the <font>
21st <$$font>.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.890

On one of the subject I have already written.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.891

With regard to the other, the Russian fortune, you will judge
better than I can whether there should be any thing in the Treaty.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.892

But it does not seem to me out of the question.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.893

Whatever is given in a marriage settlement should be placed at the ready
and easy command of the married pair, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.894

and the G. D.'s fortune should be as accessible as the dividends on
the Russian Funds, subject to any reasonable charge, if there be occasion.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.895

But at any rate I should think full subsidiary provision should be made
contemporaneously with the Treaty.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.896

I have named the 10th at 3 for the Cabinet.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.897

Having no answer to my Telegram of Monday morning I sent off
yesterday from London an offer of the P. O. to Baxter.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.901

There may I fear have been some mischance in the dispatch of your
reply which came here today <paren> Wednesday <$$paren> afternoon.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.902

Nothing could be more unfortunate than the breaking up when we were
separated of the understanding arrived at <font> viva` voce <$$font>
with Wolverton; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.903

for it is almost impossible, in nice cases, to settle these things
properly by letter, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.904

& for us, under present circumstances, every case is a nice case.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.905

I am afraid the Monarchists in France are mad: GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.906

they seem to have hitched themselves into a position when it is
a disgrace to recede & disaster of the highest order to advance.

We shall not be at Althorp till Friday of next week.

I could hardly hope that the Sec.ship of B. of Trace would have
any attractions for your brother, remarkable as I know his modesty to be.

I am I assure you extremely concerned at the failure of my little plot
against your brother: GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.914

& he'heaps coals of fire on my head'by the way in which he takes it.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.915

I did not change my mind about the suggestion, GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.916

but only gave way to his modest unwillingness.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.917

On the other hand it is really necessary, in the present state of Civil
Service agitation for increase of pay, to put a man firm in such matters
to the P. O. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.918

and such I think Baxter will be - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.919

but I have no idea whether he will accept.  GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.920

I have not yet heard from you whether you accept <font> Erle <$$font>
in lieu of James - it appearing that his health is quite adequate
, & the Chancellor having on this ground altered his preference.
