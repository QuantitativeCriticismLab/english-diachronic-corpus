I was born in Abbey-street, Dublin, on the 24th of June, 1747;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,1.33

my father was a native of the King's County, and my mother of the county
of Wexford.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,1.34

I was designed by my <P_1,2> parents and my own inclination for a painter,
and not above six years of age when I was placed at Mr. West's, the
Royal Academy, Shaw's-court, Dame-street, Dublin.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.35

West was a Waterford man, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.36

and took his painting-studies in Paris, under Boucher, the disciple of
Le Brun, distinguished for his painted series of Alexander's battles.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.37

My drawing gave me an early taste for the Antique, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.38

and consequently set me reading.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.39

From the Greek, Latin, and French, acquired under Father Austin, to whose
school in Cook-street, I went, my fancy soon strayed to Shakspeare ,
old Ben, Congreve, Cibber, and Farquhar.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.40

The first edition of Farquhar's comedies, with the prints affixed to each
of them, set me studying and acting private plays among my schoolfellows;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.41

and this transition from drawing to poetizing was ultimately <paren>
as my sight began to fail at seven-and-twenty <$$paren> very fortunate
for me: - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.42

a man can compose with his pen in the hand of an amanuensis;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,2.43

<P_1,3>

but the pencil he must hold in his own hand.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.45

When I was about four years old, there took place in Dublin a most
splendid funeral in honour of the Italian musical composer, Castruccio ;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.46

the procession formed a fine concert, vocal and instrumental, through
the streets.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.47

I got running after it, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.48

and was suddenly struck speechless, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.49

and remained in that state some hours.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.50

Whilst I was at West's academy, he took a very fine, highly finished
drawing of me, in black and white chalks: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.51

I was then about eight years old: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.52

it is in the Guido style; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.53

and from this drawing the boys used to study.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.54

The late Mr. Francis West, son, and successor to his father in the
mastership of the academy, carefully preserved it, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.55

and it is still in being, as many of my friends had latterly told me
they had seen it.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,3.56

When my daughter was in Dublin in 1811, <P_1,4> Mr. Francis West
showed it to her, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.57

and was polite enough to promise her the first good copy that any of
his young pupils should make of it.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.58

Another fine drawing, done by John Bryan, one of the students, made me
standing, leaning on the head of a Demosthenes, the port crayon in my
hand; a third of me, by Thomas Hickey, as sitting for a drawing <paren>
Hickey went draughtsman to China with Lord Macartney <$$paren> ; and a
fourth drawing, by Trotter, the centre of three heads; myself supposed
to be singing, with Cartwright, one of the boys, playing the flute on one
side, and Mr. Manning, the master of the Ornament Academy, <paren>
who had studied in Paris <$$paren> playing the violin on the other.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.59

Mine is a front face, with the right hand appearing; and the two others
profiles.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.60

These three latter drawings, with others, were preserved with great
care in the Dublin Society Rooms, as specimens of the proficiency
which the students had made under old Mr. West's tuition;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4.61

and <P_1,5> indeed his drawing of what is technically called the Academy
Figure was unrivalled.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.62

In 1754, when I was seven years of age, I saw Lord Trimlestown, at his
castle at Trimlestown, about four miles from Trim, the avenue running
down to the river Boyne.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.63

He had studied medicine abroad, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.64

and was a great botanist and physician, which his benevolence turned to
the use of rich and poor; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.65

the latter had medicine gratis, by his order, from his apothecary,
Mr. Crawley, of Trim.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.66

Lord Trimlestown's, though a real castle, was full in use as a comfortable
mansion; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.67

he kept open house, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.68

but his guests did not see much of him.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.69

His eldest son was named Matthew, his second, Sir Thomas, being a Knight
of Malta.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.70

At Lord Trimlestown's was a fine aviary of Chinese pheasants, maccaws,
&c.; and a complete greenhouse, of the rarest exotics, all under
his own management.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,5.71

I remember seeing there, the aloe <paren> which only blossoms once in
a hundred years <$$paren> in full bloom, and <P_1,6> a noble banana,
the leaf five feet long and very wide.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.72

He had a superb coach, a present from Marshal Saxe, the fine paintings
on which, were boys in the Fiamingo Stile: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.73

to copy these, some of Mr. West's pupils, and others, came
purposely from Dublin.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.74

Lord Trimlestown was, in person, tall, large, and portly: -
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.75

he dressed in scarlet, full powdered wig, and black velvet hunting-cap.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.76

My father, who was some weeks his patient, took me with him to the
castle, where I met with the greatest kindness from both Lord and Lady
Trimlestown: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.77

they gave me a full ramble among their books, valuable pictures
, portfolios of prints, rich cabinets, and splendid gardens.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,6.78

I was one day sitting alone, in a closet surrounded by gold and agate
snuffboxes, with miniature pictures in their lids, cameos, intaglios ,
coins, medals, and abundance of every thing rich and rare, when he came
in, and found me attentively looking at the coats of arms, in a little
squab book, called,"The Irish <P_1,7> Compendium: "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.79

he said nothing, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.80

but stood some time observing me, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.81

then, with a smile of goodnature, put his hand upon my head,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.82

and went out of the room.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.83

These shields and coats of arms gave me the first wish to an amusing
research in heraldry, a science which, though some may think it a kind
of frivolous foppery, often gives a useful clue to historical epoch;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.84

and my brother and I, when boys, had much pleasure from it, in looking
at the emblazonry on the coaches as they passed through the streets - the
coronets, helmets, degrees of nobility, &c.; - reminding each other
of the old scroll of parchment in my father's possession, so cracked and
rumpled and rolled that it could scarcely be opened; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.85

and, with a kind of anticipation, we, the future painter and poet,
declared we would yet have the arms of the <font> Kings of Fermoy <$$font>
, the old crown and rampant supporters, on our own coaches and landaus.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.86

At that time, I sung and drew prettily enough, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,7.87

and every night, at their supper table, <P_1,8> I was seated between Lord
and Lady Trimlestown, with my custard and my orange placed before me.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.88

I saw also at that time Lord Gormanston, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.89

he was elderly, of the middle size, and always dressed in a full suit
of light blue.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.90

On my father's departure from Trimlestown, he and my mother and I went
to Knock-Drin, near Edenderry, where my father with pride, not unmixed
with dejection, led me over tracts of fine lands, once the property of
his ancestors: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.91

my mother had much the same remark to make of <font> her <$$font> family
losses in the county of Wexford.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.92

Bryan Kavanagh, my mother's <font> first <$$font> cousin, was the last
person of note who had any landed property left on that part of the
globe, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.93

and he did not remain long in Ireland, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.94

for having taken holy orders, he left his worldly affairs there in the
management of a lawyer in Henry Street, Dublin, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.95

and went to France OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.96

and settled at Bourdeaux, where he rose to be a dignitary of the Church.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,8.97

When he became possessed of rich and extensive lands, vineyards,
<P_1,9> and tenements, he wrote over to my father and mother, to send
either my brother Daniel or me to him, with the offer to educate us
for any one of the three professions, the Church, the law, or the army;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.98

but unfortunately neither of us were ever sent.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.99

My only and elder brother, Dan O'Keeffe, <paren> afterwards an eminent
miniature painter <$$paren> was reserved by fate to flatter people on
ivory in England, and Jack O'Keeffe to make Hay for the Market, and grow
Flowers for the Garden.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.100

However, having the future advantage of my children in view, the said
catholic dignitary, Bryan Kavanagh, being my <font> second <$$font>
and their <font> third <$$font> cousin, I caused inquiries to be made
during the short peace in 1802 by a French gentleman, still living
at St. Quintin, concerning these French lands and possessions;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.101

he wrote to Bourdeaux for me, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.102

and made every exertion to that purpose, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,9.103

but never could learn what Robespierre or Buonaparte had <P_1,10> done
with them, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.104

and we are now contented and happy in the idea that they have been
since re-royalized in the persons of Louis the Eighteenth, and Charles
the Tenth, Kings of France: the buckles of the latter royal gentleman
I having popularized in 1779, in these words of Bouquet's song in the"
Son-in-Law,""My Artois buckles when you view In shining, sable, satin
shoe. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.105

To return to Trimlestown Castle.  I remember a very fine live eagle
perched before the front door on the lawn, to whom the servants threw
pieces of meat within the length of his chain.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.106

One day, when I was standing watching the noble bird of Jove, an unlucky
dog, one of the hounds, attracted by the meat, ventured within the limits
of this eagle's iron tether: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.107

with furious rapidity, the eagle darted down, pouncing full upon the
dog's back with beak and talons.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.108

Some days after, the bird broke his chain OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.109

and soared into the skies; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,10.110

then dropped <P_1,11> into a field, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.111

seized a lamb, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.112

and carried it up into a high tree: - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.113

I forget whether either eagle or lamb were recovered.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.114

The only other person in Ireland that I recollect possessed with this
sublime fancy of retaining Jupiter's thunder-bearer to perch before
his door, was Mr. Brockhill Newburgh, who lived in Dublin,
at Glassmanogue.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.115

He was head of the Linen Board, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.116

and played very finely on the harpsichord.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.117

I have often been in company with him at the house of Mrs.
Jefferies.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.118

John Hunter, the distinguished surgeon, brother to Dr. Hunter, who
lectured at the Royal Academy, Somerset-House, also had eagles perched
before his door at Earl's Court, near London, where I have frequently
stood to observe them.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.119

I think the latter eagles might consider themselves very well off to
escape dissection; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.120

for their owner dissected every thing that came in his way; - the kraken
of the sea, the grasshopper in clover, and the lady-bird on her <font>
boghill-en-bwee.  <$$font> OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,11.121

<P_1,12>

In 1756, Hamilton <paren> afterwards eminent in the first class of
historical painters in England <$$paren> was my fellow-student in the
R. A. in Dublin: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.123

he might have been five years my elder; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.124

and was remarkable for choosing, when drawing the human figure,
the most foreshortened view, consequently the most difficult -
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.125

<paren> the finest specimen of foreshortening is that of King Charles's
Apotheosis in the ceiling of the chapel at Whitehall.  <$$paren>
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.126

Our premiums were adjudged once a-year, in the House of Lords, Dublin :
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.127

the drawings of the candidates were pinned round the walls to be examined
as to their merits and classes.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.128

The boy wrote previously in chalk under his drawing"from the life,
"if it was so; and"from the round,"if from a bust or statue.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.129

My brother Daniel, being one year one of the younger candidates,
and all full of their gambols, got to plucking off the large scarlet
tassels and bobbins from the benches, and pelting them at each other.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,12.130

One of these struck Hamilton's drawing, which being in chalks was
consequently <P_1,13> much injured.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.131

He, enraged, thinking that poor Dan had done the mischief, gave him a
most tremendous box on the ear.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.132

This accident, by the drawing being spoiled, lost Hamilton the premium.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.133

The names of those who obtained the premiums, and their different classes,
were in the newspapers: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.134

this was the proudest stimulus to our emulation.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.135

I obtained many premiums in the different classes, and once the head
premium for my drawing of the Ariadne, the well-known fine antique.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.136

We were early familiarized to the antique in sculpture, and in painting
, to the style and manner of the great Italian and French masters.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.137

We also studied anatomy; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.138

and, indeed, the students there turned their minds to most of the
sciences.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.139

We had upon the large table in the Academy, a figure three feet
high, called the anatomy figure; the skin off to show the muscles:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.140

on each muscle was a little paper with a figure of reference to a
description of it, and its uses.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.141

We had also a living figure, to stand or sit: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,13.142

he <P_1,14> was consequently a fine person; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.143

his pay was four shillings an hour.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.144

Mr. West himself always <font> posed <$$font> the figure, as the
phrase is, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.145

and the students took their views round the table where he was fixed.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.146

To make it certain that his attitude was the same each time we took our
study, Mr. West with a chalk marked upon the table the exact spot
where his foot, or his elbow or his hand came.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.147

We had a large round iron stove nearly in the centre of the school,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.148

but the fire was not seen; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.149

an iron tube conveyed the smoke through the wall.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.150

On the flat top of this stove, we used to lay our pencils of black and
white chalk to harden them.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.151

The room was very lofty: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.152

it had only three windows; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.153

they were high up in the wall, and so contrived as to make the light
descend: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.154

the centre window was arched, and near the top of the ceiling.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,14.155

At each end of this room was a row of presses with glass doors; in which
were kept the statues cast from the real antique, each upon a pedestal
about two feet <P_1,15> high, and drawn out into the room as they were
wanted to be studied from: - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.156

but the busts were placed, when required, on the table.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.157

The stools we sat upon were square portable boxes, very strong and solid,
with a hole in the form of an S on each side to put in the hand and
move them.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.158

Each student had a mahogany drawing-board of his own:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.159

this was a square of three feet by four; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.160

at one end was a St. Andrew's cross, fastened with hinges, which
answered for a foot; and on the other end of the board, a ledge to lay
our port crayons upon.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.161

When we rose from our seats, we laid this board flat upon the ground,
with the drawing we were then doing upon it.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.162

We had a clever civil little fellow for our porter, to run about and
buy our oranges and apples, and pencils, and crayons, and move our busts
and statues for us.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.163

He was a great favourite; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,15.164

and Mr. West used every day to say to him,"Master <font> Fling ,
<$$font> <paren> his real name was Flynn, <$$paren> bring me a seedy
<font> rowl,"<$$font> - and put a <P_1,16> halfpenny in his hand.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.165

We had some students who studied statuary alone, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.166

and they modelled in clay.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.167

Cunningham <paren> brother to the poet <$$paren> invented the
small basso-relievo portraits, in wax of the natural colours:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.168

they had oval frames, and convex crystal glasses OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.169

and were in great fashion.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.170

Berville, a most enthusiastic Frenchman, full of professional ardour,
studied with us: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.171

and Van-Nost, the celebrated statuary, often came amongst us:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.172

he did the fine pedestrian statue of Lord Blakeney, erected in
Sackville-street.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.173

The members of the Dublin Society, composed of the Lord Lieutenant and
most of the nobility, and others, frequently visited our academy to see
our goings on: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.174

and some of the lads were occasionally sent to Rome, to study the
Italian masters.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.175

I was present, <paren> when about four years old, <$$paren>
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.176

and saw the cases containing the casts from the antique brought from Rome,
and opened; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.177

and from these in a very few years I studied.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,16.178

<P_1,17>

One day, passing through Parliament-street, Dublin, George Faulkner,
the printer, was standing at his own shop-door; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.180

I was induced to stare in at a bust on the counter.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.181

He observed me, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.182

and by the portfolio under my arm, knew I was a pupil at the Royal
Academy.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.183

I remained in fixed attention, when he kindly invited me in to look at
the bust, saying it was the head of his friend and patron Dean Swift.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.184

To display it in all its different views, he turned it round and about
for me, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.185

and then brought me up stairs to see the picture of Swift.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.186

George Faulkner was a fat little man, with a large well-powdered wig,
and brown clothes: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.187

his precision of speech in using the word <font> opposite <$$font>
instead of <font> facing <$$font>, was the cause of Swift choosing him
for his printer.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.188

At this period of my boyhood Swift's memory was recent;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.189

he was greatly beloved and revered in Dublin.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.190

There were many signs of him in canonicals: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.191

they were called the Drapier's Head, from the signature of his letters
against Wood's halfpence OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,17.192

<P_1,18>

I have one of those halfpence.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.194

Amongst a multitude of benevolent actions, he lent small sums to
tradespeople, to be repaid at a shilling a-week, five pounds the
greatest sum; which practice laid the foundation of many a fortune
obtained by industry, and was the support of numerous families;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.195

but one neglect of the shilling a-week repayment, no more money was lent
by him to that person.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.196

Whenever the Dean walked out, the people followed him with shouts of
blessings, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.197

and the children held his cassock.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.198

My early passion for the drama made me like Swift, from his having been
a friend of Gay.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.199

The above house of George Faulkner was the corner of Parliament-street,
and Essex-street, on the right hand.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.200

Mr. Dickson of Capel-street, brought paintings of birds
and flowers <paren> basso relievo <$$paren> into great fashion:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.201

they were done in water-colours, upon large sheets of card-paper.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.202

Twelve made the set, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,18.203

and were painted for him by three <P_1,19> youths of considerable merit:
the eldest, James Riley; Gustavus Hamilton, the son of a clergyman;
and my brother Daniel.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.204

They lived in Dickson's house, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.205

and had a table and every thing comfortable and respectable.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.206

My brother, the youngest of the three, had often a number of boys,
his acquaintances, both in and out of the house after him, <paren>
not those of the academy, <$$paren> allured by getting now and then
a camel-hair pencil, or a bit of paint to colour their tops, and draw
stars and moons upon their kites.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.207

I often made one in this noisy string of intruders, being then about
six years of age.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.208

All this was really troublesome and disagreeable to the house in
general, but particularly to Mrs. Dickson's elder sister.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.209

One day, as many of us ran out of the street through the hall, and
rushed upstairs, all full intent to see <font> Daniel <$$font> O'Keeffe
, this old widow lady started in a violent passion out of the parlour,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.210

and exclaimed, -"Hey day!  what plaguy tribe is here! "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,19.211

- I happened to be the <P_1,20> last of the procession,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.212

and turning round said,"The tribe of <font> Dan.  <$$font>"
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.213

On hearing such an answer from an urchin, her anger instantly changed
to a full fit of merriment: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.214

she clapped her hands to her sides, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.215

and there stood laughing full five minutes <font> sans <$$font>
intermission.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.216

This childish anecdote may be as well worth recording as that of
Dr. Johnson's"Good master Duck. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.217

These three young lads who painted birds and flowers so admirably,
turned out distinguished painters in miniature.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.218

Riley was enabled to have a fine house of his own in Grafton-street,
Dublin; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.219

Hamilton was encouraged and patronized by ladies of the first rank there
, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.220

and made a power of money by his pencil; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.221

and my brother's field of action was London, where he died of consumption
at the age of 47.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.222

He was tall and thin, very fair and delicately florid, blue eyes, his
hair light.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,20.223

His only daughter, Anne O'Keeffe, whom he had brought up with care and
tenderness at Boulogne <P_1,21> in France, also died of consumption,
aged 28.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.224

It is remarkable, that the above-mentioned house in Capel-street,
inhabited by Dickson, was formerly the residence of Dr. Sheridan ,
father to Thomas Sheridan, the actor, and grandfather to Richard Brinsley.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.225

The yard at the back, where I have often played at marbles, was the
play-ground of his scholars; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.226

and the school-room, wherein the boy made the impromptu of"The Rat and
the Bell-rope, and the Stairs,"was, at this time, Dickson's coach-house.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.227

This very worthy, industrious, and truly useful member of society <paren>
Dickson <$$paren> first established <paren> at Leixlip <$$paren> the
beautiful and admired linen copperplate printing, which delineated
flowers in all their natural beauty.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.228

To my great sorrow, I heard long after that this laudable and patriotic
scheme was the ruin of his worldly affairs.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,21.229

It was, and perhaps is still, the Dublin custom on St. James's Day,
for the relations and <P_1,22> friends of those buried in St.
James's church-yard, to dress up the graves with flowers, cut paper,
Scripture phrases, garlands, chaplets, and a number of other pretty
and pious devices, where those affectionate mementos remained, until
displaced by fresh ones the next year.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.230

In this state, the whole church-yard made a most interesting and pleasing
appearance: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.231

every body went to see it; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.232

and I, when about nine years of age, went on St. James's Day.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.233

On my return home, full of the fine sight, I got my materials,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.234

and set to at drawing St. James's church-yard.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.235

Amongst tombstones in the foreground, I drew a very large one, with a
high flat stone at the head OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.236

and wrote on it,"Here lies the body of -. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.237

As I had exhausted my stock of names on my other tombstones, I was
puzzled for a name for this: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.238

at that moment, a man happened to come into the room, with a pair of
new shoes for my father: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,22.239

he was of the county of Wexford, a very good shoemaker, and a very honest
fellow - in health and person remarkably <P_1,23> well-looking; strong,
tall, and athletic.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.240

His name being Paddy Furlong, I, most <font> apropos <$$font>, wrote
upon my tombstone"Patrick Furlong. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.241

He had been looking over my shoulder, and admiring the drawing;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.242

but, when he saw me add his own name, seemed a little startled.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.243

With the thoughtlessness of childhood, I went on writing"Who died on
the -"OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.244

here I was at another stand; when the Wexford shoemaker said to me -"On
the Second of September, - put down that. "- OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.245

I did so.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.246

-"One thousand seven hundred and fifty-six: put down that. "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.247

I complied, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.248

and away he went.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.249

About a week after, we heard he was ill, and dangerously so;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.250

and in a few weeks more, we were told that he had died on the 2d of
September, the very day he himself had desired me to write on the
tombstone.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,23.251

Amongst a few unlucky drawing exploits of mine when a boy, one day calling
with my brother at a house in Henry-street, where he had some business,
I rambled into the dining-parlour, <P_1,24> in which the table had been
laid out by the butler and other servants, all in form; company of the
first order having been invited that day.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.252

On observing the fine expanded damask tablecloth,"Ha! "thought I,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.253

"no sheet of paper is so large as this; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.254

the very thing $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} long been wishing for. "
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.255

Seeing an inkstand on the sideboard, I took it, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.256

placed it on the table, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.257

and, inspired by my subject, which was a fine deer hunt, I drew with
pen and ink a stag, at full speed, with head and horns erect; and then
a full pack of hounds in the regular order of pursuit; and after them
the huntsman on his horse, winding his horn, followed up by a number of
hunting squires, all on horseback, as I myself had often seen them near
Dunleary, and Bray, and Laughlin's Town, with Johnny Adair of Kilternan
at their head.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.258

This pen and ink performance of mine stretched the whole length of the
table, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.259

and I brought forward a chair, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.260

and stood upon it, that I might look down upon my work with the greatest
advantages of delight, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,24.261

<P_1,25>

but to my confusion I soon heard with many bitter remarks, that I had
spoiled the rich fine valuable table cloth.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.263

I was about nine years of age, when having one day to go down Dame-street,
I joined company at the top, near College Green, with my fellow-student
whom I have mentioned before, Johnny Bryan, who was going the same way.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.264

He was at this time my senior, and much taller and older than me; indeed,
of the first rank as a proficient in drawing; of a placid, mild character,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.265

and I liked him much.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.266

We walked on, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.267

and kept in conversation until we reached within a few yards of Crampton
Court, at the lower end of Dame-street, I being outside, and he on my
right hand.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.268

Now and then, as we talked, I looked up in his face:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.269

by degrees, I thought I saw some change in the features, which surprised
me - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.270

yet still we walked on, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.271

and kept up the conversation.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.272

At length, looking up anxiously at his face, the change came full upon
me, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,25.273

and I felt a tremor and alarm through <P_1,26> my whole frame that I
could not account for.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.274

I looked more stedfastly, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.275

and observed some traits in the face that I had never seen before.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.276

Still we continued our way, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.277

and kept talking to each other: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.278

but now, though the street was full of people passing and repassing,
<paren> it being at that time the greatest thoroughfare in Dublin,
<$$paren> I was seized with perfect terror, as seeming spellbound to
the figure that was walking at my side.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.279

I once more looked up, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.280

and was unable to repress my horror and dismay, when he stopped and
smiled, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.281

and in a kind voice, looking down upon me, said"You think you are speaking
to my brother Johnny, your schoolfellow. " OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.282

I found afterwards that it was very common to mistake these brothers
for each other, they were so like in person, and dressed alike.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.283

I had never before seen the elder brother, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.284

and to this day $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forget the shock I felt at
this adventure.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,26.285

The river Liffey, above Island Bridge, was <P_1,27> divided into two
streams, the broad wiers, and the narrow wiers.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.286

The Dublin boys were much in the habit of going there to swim.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.287

One day, a schoolfellow of mine, Robert Healy, and I <paren> we were
both about ten years of age <$$paren> went up there on our rambles.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.288

We were swimming in that part of the river above where it divides,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.289

and, by our carelessness, were drawn by the current into the narrow
wiers: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.290

the stream was rapid, smooth and black from its depth, and nearly
inaccessible on both sides.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.291

Though we were both excellent swimmers, yet our skill had no more effect
than to keep us on the surface of the water.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.292

Turn about, or change the direction in which we were forced on by the
current, we could not.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.293

However, Healy, with his right hand, caught hold of some overhanging
bushes, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.294

and drew himself in from the power of the current.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.295

At that instant, the force of the water was hurrying me on rapidly -
when he stretched out his left hand, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,27.296

and, at the instant I was passing him, caught me by the <P_1,28> hair,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.297

and drew me by degrees towards himself.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.298

At this moment, I was within ten yards of a wide arch, that opened
under the mill, and into which, but for this wonderful interposition of
Providence, I must inevitably have been hurried, and mangled and torn
by the wheels and machinery inside.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.299

This mill stood on the south side of Island Bridge,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.300

and at the corner a lane runs from it up to John's Well.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.301

Healy went to West's at the same time with me, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.302

and by his ability arrived at the highest point of his profession;
drawing in chalks, portraits, &c.: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.303

but his chief forte was horses, which he delineated so admirably, that
he got plenty of employment from those who had favourite hunters, racers,
or ladies'palfreys.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.304

He was a kind and good-natured boy, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.305

and I had a great friendship for him.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.306

On the site where Crow-street Theatre was built, once stood a fabric,
called the Music Hall.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.307

I recollect seeing this building: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.308

the front, with great gates, faced the end of Crow-street:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,28.309

<P_1,29>

and here Handel had his sublime oratorios performed, he in person
presiding.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.311

I well remember seeing the bill of Handel's concert on the gate of this
hall, in 1758.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.312

This circumstance was many years previous to his even composing his
beautiful"Water Music,"and having it played in the barge, to the surprise
and delight of George the Second; which noble device replaced him in
the full favour of his royal master.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.313

His talents, so cherished in Dublin, made me exult in seeing him in his
exalted niche, and marble organ, in Westminster Abbey, when I went first
to London.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.314

Whilst the foundations of Crow-street Theatre were preparing on this
spot, I, amongst other boys, <paren> Remus-like <$$paren> got jumping
over them, little thinking that on the very stage then erecting would,
in process of time, rise my own fabric of"The Castle of Andalusia.
"OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.315

Crow-street opened with Cibber's comedy of"She would, and she would
not. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,29.316

A man was pressed to death the first night, going up the <P_1,30> upper
gallery stairs: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.317

some ill fate seems to hang upon this play.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.318

One of the new managers, Woodward, was the Trappanti of that night.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.319

In my boyhood, I often heard the famous singers of sacred music;
Colloghan, in the choir of St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Father
Neale, of the Catholic Chapel.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.320

They were both very fat: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.321

Colloghan's voice was a noble bass, and Neale's a fine treble, with a
falsetto, which he managed with great effect.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.322

In 1755 the celebrated Mrs. Woffington acted, in the first play
I ever saw, Alicia, in"Jane Shore. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.323

I remember, some years after, seeing her mother, whom she comfortably
supported; a respectable-looking old lady, in her short black velvet
cloak, with deep rich fringe, a diamond ring, and small agate snuffbox.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.324

She had nothing to mind but going the rounds of the Catholic chapels
and chatting with her neighbours.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,30.325

Mrs. Woffington, the actress, built and endowed a number of
alms-houses <P_1,31> at Teddington, Middlesex, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.326

and there they are to this day.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.327

She is buried in the church; her name on her tomb-stone.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.328

Dr. Baldwin, the provost of Dublin College, was a meagre old man:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.329

I saw him when dead lie in state.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.330

His successor, Dr. Andrews, was a fine, jolly, fresh looking man,
very fond of the theatre, and a member of the Beef-steak Club, at which
Mrs. Woffington presided.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.331

The Duke of Dorset was then Lord Lieutenant.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.332

Lord George Sackville <paren> afterwards Lord George Germaine <$$paren>
was the soul of the party; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.333

and, though an actress headed the table, politics was the favourite
dish, for which Thomas Sheridan <paren> the elder <$$paren> had his old
house pulled over his ears -"Mahomet {COM:reference_to_mahomet_riots}
"for that!  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.334

On the first and great successful run of Gay's"Beggar's Opera," in London,
his friend Swift with his powerful pen raised its character very high
in Dublin, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,31.335

and in a booth erected in George's Lane, the opera was performed by
<P_1,32> children: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.336

little Peggy Woffington, in Polly, made her first appearance on any stage.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.337

In my childhood, the finest collection of pictures in Ireland were those
of Mr. Stewart, <paren> afterwards Lord Londonderry, <$$paren>
in Henry Street, of Major Whitelock, and of the Bishop of Clogher.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.338

At Mr. Stewart's I saw the Veronica of <paren> I think <$$paren>
Gerard Dow, the finest picture I had ever seen; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.339

the subject is well known: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.340

it is a full front face of our blessed Saviour, without any shadow:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.341

it seemed to me a miraculous excellence in the art of the painter.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.342

Dr. Padmore, in Britain-street, had a capital collection of
pictures: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.343

he was a real virtuoso, a little man, with sallow round face, tie wig,
black clothes, and scarlet stockings: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.344

when I was about eight years old, I used to go to his house, and draw
from his pictures.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,32.345

I remember Captain Debrisay, who, upwards of seventy years of age, walked
the streets of Dublin unremarked, in the old dress, worn in the days of
Charles the Second; a large cocked <P_1,33> hat, all on one side his face,
nearly covering his left eye; a great powdered wig, hanging at the side in
curls, and in the centre at the back a large black cockade, with a small
drop curl from it; his embroidered waistcoat down to his knees; the top
of his coat not within three inches of his neck, the hip buttons about
a foot from it; buttons all the way down the coat , but only one at the
waist buttoned; the hilt of the sword through the opening of the skirt;
a long cravat, fringed, the end pulled through the third button-hole;
small buckles; the coat sleeves very short, and the shirt sleeves pulled
down, but hid by the top of the gloves, and the ruffles hanging out at
the opening of the cuff; the waistcoat entirely open except the lower
button, displaying the finely plaited frill.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,33.346

Captain Debrisay's two sons were in the artillery, and great Castle
people: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,33.347

many years after, I often saw them and Miss Debrisay on the command
nights at the theatre.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,33.348

Over his <P_1,34> hall door, in the street, was a fine statue of Mars.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.349

In my boyhood a very tragic circumstance happened at the house of this
Captain Debrisay.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.350

There were new steps and an arched landing put to the street-door,
under which was an area: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.351

the servant maid was washing plates or something of that sort under
these steps, when the mortar gave way, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.352

the arch and steps fell, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.353

and she was crushed to death.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.354

A poor man who sold cakes, which he called by the Dublin names, and had
in panniers on each side a little ass, had a custom every day of crying
out when passing Captain Debrisay's house,"$Here $'s {TEXT:Here's}
a fine <font> pyclet <$$font> for Mary!  <paren> Pyclet is the London
muffin; crumpets are not known there; <$$paren> and some nice <font>
galbonians <$$font> for Mary!  and some fine French faddles for Mary!
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.355

where are you, Mary?  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.356

where are you now, Mary?  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.357

where are you now, Mary, Mary, Mary? "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,34.358

In this full cry he was coming down the street, and approaching the
house when the <P_1,35> accident happened, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.359

and just as he vociferated"Mary!  Mary!  where are you <font> now,
<$$font> Mary? "he saw the crowd, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.360

<paren> I was in it, <$$paren> OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.361

and heard the fate of the poor girl.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.362

The awful sound to the sympathizing people was"Where are you <font> now,
<$$font> Mary, Mary, Mary? "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.363

The builder was on the spot; his face and manner most appalling.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.364

In 1760, being thirteen years of age, my choice seat was up in a tree
near my aunt $Byrne $'s {TEXT:Byrne's} house in Dorset-street, almost
opposite this Captain Debrisay's.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.365

One day, perched up there <paren> like Charles II. in his oak
<$$paren>, I saw pass under me the Artillery going to the North to oppose
Thurot, when he landed at Carrickfergus.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.366

The people of Dublin seemed easy enough about it.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.367

Some years after, when I was at Belfast, and took drawings of that town
for Lord Donnegal, I also took a view of Carrickfergus, from a distance
of about three miles; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,35.368

and, though a four-wheeled carriage of Lord Donnegal's, and his servants
in liveries attended me, yet such were the apprehensions and terrors
<P_1,36> that Thurot's descent left upon the Carrickfergus people, that
the mayor sent some of his officers on horseback to post off towards me ,
and make a strict inquiry what I was about by taking drawings of the town,
the bay, and the castle.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.369

Certainly my dress and manner had somewhat of a Frenchified appearance
, with my hair fully powdered, a little rose-bag and small gold-laced
cocked hat.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.370

An incident in R. B. Sheridan's"Camp,"was so very like
this circumstance, that most probably he had previously heard of it.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.371

In his piece Moody was the Irish artist who is drawing, and in
a very good equivoque taken into custody for it by the soldier.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.372

I mentioned my own affair at the time to Lord Donnegal and many others.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.373

In the year 1760, when Thurot actually had possession of the Castle ,
Mr. Tottenham Heaphy, afterwards my father-in-law, was at supper
with others at Gilmer's tavern, opposite Crow-street Theatre, Dublin,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.374

and hearing of it, he ran to the stable where his horse was,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.375

mounted, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,36.376

<P_1,37>

and set off full speed towards the North.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.378

When he had gone about twenty miles or so, he met a courier posting
with intelligence for the Lord Lieutenant at the Castle of Dublin.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.379

Mr. Heaphy remarking that his horse was a poor sort of jade,
and incompetent to the haste the emergency of the business required,
made him mount his own horse, a very capital one, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.380

and took the tired hack of the messenger.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.381

He never saw his horse again; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.382

however, the affair was very well known, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.383

and did Mr. Heaphy and his family no harm.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,37.384

- Lord Howth.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.415

In my boyhood and youth I often saw the grand triennial sight called
the Franchises.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.416

The first view of it made a great impression on my mind:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.417

I was seated in the front window of my cousin $Kavanagh $'s
{TEXT:Kavanagh's} house in Thomas-street, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.418

and saw the procession pass close under me.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.419

It consisted of the riding and walking of the trades of Dublin <paren>
there called Corporations <$$paren>.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,38.420

<P_1,39>

The whole were first assembled and marshalled in the great square of
Stephen's Green, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.422

and from thence in order commenced their perambulations of the city.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.423

Many of the trades were remarkable for the splendour of their pageants,
as most persons of rank who had handsome equipages and fine horses and
trappings lent them for this day's cavalcade.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.424

The printers had a large splendid open carriage, in which was a printing
press, the compositors setting types, and the men working off impressions,
which, as fast as they printed, they flung to the populace in the streets:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.425

this was a description of the whole procession, masters, wardens, colours,
&c., and a <font> finely-written <$$font> explanatory poem.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.426

The smiths had a grand high phaeton, in which sat the most beautiful
young girl that could be found, as Venus; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.427

at the corners were Cupids and Loves and the Graces, and so forth;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.428

and Vulcan in armour rode by her side.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.429

The carriage of the weavers was also very handsome:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,39.430

the men wore large <P_1,40> wigs of wool of different colours.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.431

The millers and bakers had men dressed up in wheat sheaves.  The masons
and carpenters, all the emblems of masonry, with Solomon's Temple,
&c. OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.432

The curriers were represented by men appareled in skins, with large
grotesque masks, and great wooden falchions, which they flourished about.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.433

The chandlers were $remarkably {TEXT:remarkably} fine for horses, dress,
and accoutrements: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.434

their insignia was a dove, and their motto"Let your light so shine.
"OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.435

The hosiers had in their carriage the stocking-loom, and a man really
weaving stockings, and at the corners of the carriage young women at
their wheels, spinning silk, flax, and cotton.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.436

The goldsmiths, glass-makers, jewellers, carvers and gilders ,
had each their sumptuous pageant expressive of their trade.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.437

The linen weavers had in their vehicle a loom, at which they were employed
in weaving as they rode along: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.438

young women were spinning, and a youth dressed as a collegian,
<font> en badinage <$$font>, breaking their threads, &c.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,40.439

The <P_1,4l> shoemakers displayed a prince and princess, - Crispin and
Crispiana, - dressed in gold and silver robes, and crowns, with two
little pages carrying between them a crimson velvet cushion, and on it
a gold slipper.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.440

The vintners had Bacchus, dressed in ivy and vine leaves, astride upon
a tun, with a bowl of wine in his two hands, drinking to the health
of the people; and a number of bacchanals, Silenus, fauns, and satyrs,
following him.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.441

The upholsterers were headed by a man dressed all in feathers:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.442

he was called the Featherman, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.443

and, from his arch gambols and comic attitudes, was the great delight
of the crowd.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.444

It became a saying to anything of high humour,"Oh, this beats the
Feather-man! "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.445

The Guild, or corporation of merchants, were all in uniform,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.446

and rode remarkably fine horses of their own.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.447

Each trade had a band of music, and its own appropriate tune; so that as
one party was passing by you, the particular air was heard at a distance,
proclaiming the approach of the next.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,4l.448

The whole cavalcade <P_1,42> and procession consisted of many thousand
persons, all arranged with strict decorum in their proper places.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.449

Each corporation had its masters, wardens, and beadles, dressed and
equipped in full paraphernalia.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.450

The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, &c. made part of the show.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.451

When they reached the end of the North Wall, the Lord Mayor and his
attendants got into a barge, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.452

and were rowed out into the bay, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.453

and at a particular station, he stood up, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.454

and with all his force threw a dart from him into the sea, as far as he
could: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.455

where the dart fell, a buoy was fixed, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.456

and as far as that, his warrant, as Lord Mayor of the city, reached,
extending to every vessel within that buoy.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.457

In what is called the Earl of $Meath $'s {TEXT:Meath's} Liberty, the Lord
Mayor of Dublin has no jurisdiction, this quarter of the town having a
court of its own.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,42.458

This Liberty consists of some of the largest, finest, and richest streets
in Dublin; for instance, Meath-street, Francis-street, and the <P_1,43>
Coombie.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.459

In the latter was the Weavers'Hall: over the gate a pedestrian gilt
statue, as large as life, of George the Second.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.460

The Lord Mayor walked the boundaries, his sword-bearer before him;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.461

but when arrived at the point where the Liberty begins, he was met
by a certain chosen number of people, who stopped his progress, and
in a kind of seeming scuffle took the sword from the sword-bearer:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.462

if not thus prevented, and the Lord Mayor permitted to go on, wherever
he went, with his sword of office borne before him, the power of his
warrant would reach; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.463

but this ceremony is done without the least riot or ill-will, being part
of the business previously well prepared.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.464

All this affair took place in one day, the first of August, every
third year.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.465

To this grand triennial festival people flocked to Dublin from all
parts of Ireland, England, Scotland, and even from the Continent:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.466

it was always looked to with great joy.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.467

The Regatta at Venice was something in this way.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,43.468

Many <P_1,44> years after I wrote a piece, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.469

and had it brought out at Crow-street, for the express purpose of
introducing the procession, and beautiful pageantry of our Dublin
franchises.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.470

I knew Counseller Leonard Mac Nally, when a boy.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.471

His uncle was an eminent merchant in Dublin, of the name of Featherstone
, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.472

and lived in Mary's-lane; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.473

he had another uncle, Arthur Murphy, <paren> not the poet <$$paren>.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.474

Mrs. Mac Nally, his mother, was one of the finest persons of a
woman I ever saw; tall, full, and majestic.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.475

Leonard himself was much under size, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.476

but had a handsome, expressive countenance, and fine sparkling dark eye
{COM:sic}: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.477

he was a sprightly boy; and such his passion for private plays, that
he was indulged in having a little theatre fitted up in his mother's
house, which all the boys of his turn frequented, - I one of them.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.478

Many years after, Mac Nally was editor of the Ledger, a London newspaper,
and very indulgent to my pieces as they appeared.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.479

His own opera of"Robin Hood,"had great success: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,44.480

his uncle, <P_1,45> Arthur Murphy, coming to London, Mac Nally brought
him to Covent-garden Theatre to see it; when, to the surprise of the
author, and the vexation of both, the opera was that night performed
as an afterpiece, having been, without his knowledge, cut down into
two acts: such the mortifications of even a successful dramatic poet.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.481

He also wrote a comedy,"Fashionable Levities,"and a farce,
"Retaliation,"both very successful.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.482

Tired with literary fagging, Mac Nally went back to Dublin,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.483

and pursued his profession as a barrister.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.484

I was told he excelled all his contemporaries in keen and sarcastic
wit, - a most effective legal weapon in defence of a client.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.485

Counsellor and Mrs. Costello were great supporters of the drama
in Mossop's time.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.486

He was a distinguished pleader, and remarkable for his brogue, which many
of the most eminent men at the Irish bar affected: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.487

it made them favourites, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.488

and sent their sarcasms with more force in irony.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,45.489

A poor country fellow came <P_1,46> one day to surrender himself to take
his trial on a capital charge.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.490

Drawing Costello aside, he gave him a guinea as a fee,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.491

and asked his advice.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.492

The counsellor desired him to tell him frankly his case, without any
concealment.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.493

He did so.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.494

Having patiently listened to it,"My good fellow,"said Costello,
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.495

"you see that staircase: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.496

my opinion and advice is, that you walk down instantly into the street,
turn the corner on the right hand, make the best of your way to the quay ,
get into the first ship you can find ready to sail, and never again be
found in Ireland, England, or Scotland; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.497

- and here, take back the guinea you gave me for my advice, towards
travelling charges. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.498

Costello saw that the unfortunate man, though not culpable, from some
particular points of law, which he fore-knew would come out upon the
trial, must have suffered.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.499

What is called barrister in England, is called counsellor in Ireland:
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.500

the word barrister is not known there.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,46.501

When I was a child, I saw the famous Sir Toby Butler, a favourite
lawyer of his time, <P_1,47> his powers of oratory being great;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.502

but he always drank his bottle before he went to the courts.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.503

A client, very solicitous about the success of his cause,
requested Sir Toby not to drink his accustomed bottle that morning.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.504

Sir Toby promised on his honour he would not.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.505

He went to the court, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.506

pleaded, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.507

and gained a verdict.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.508

The client met him exulting in the success of his advice; when, to his
astonishment, Sir Toby assured him that if he had <font> not <$$font>
taken his bottle, he should have lost the cause.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.509

"But your promise, Sir Toby? "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.510

-"I kept it faithfully and honourably, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.511

I did not <font> drink <$$font> a drop - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.512

I poured my bottle of claret into a wheaten loaf OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.513

and <font> ate <$$font> it.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.514

So I had my bottle, you your verdict, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.515

and I am a man of my word. "OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.516

Sir Toby Butler is buried in St. James's Church-yard, Dublin,
not far from the entrance; an iron rail round the tomb, and a stone
figure of himself in wig and gown, lying all along on the top of it.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.517

Near this tombstone, my father, John O'Keeffe, was buried, in the
year 1758.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,47.518

<P_1,48>

About the year 1759, Mrs. Abingdon was in great celebrity in
Dublin, the leader of fashion, and favourite of the ladies of the highest
rank, who consulted her taste and fancy in their dresses, &c.; and
in London, plagued her much on masquerade nights; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.520

- the Abingdon cap I remember all the rage: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.521

her manner was most charmingly fascinating, and her speaking voice
melodious.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.522

She had peculiar tricks in acting; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.523

one was turning her wrist, and seeming to stick a pin in the side of
her waist: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.524

she was also very adroit in the exercise of her fan;
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.525

and, though equally capital in fine ladies and hoydens, was never seen
in low or vulgar characters.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.526

On her benefit night, the pit was always railed into the boxes.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.527

Her acting shone brightest when doing Estifania, with Brown's Copper
Captain: OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.528

their comic excellence was a rich dramatic feast.  OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.529

Her maiden name was Barton - OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.530

her husband, a neat little gentlemanly figure, belonged to the band.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,48.531

Mrs. Abingdon's prudent custom, when in London, was to adapt her
residence <P_1,49> to her means for the time; OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,49.532

when she was in the full swing of money, she had a fine house in
Piccadilly, opposite the Green Park, OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,49.533

and when not so rich in purse was content with humbler dwellings.
OKEEFFE-1826-1,1,49.534
