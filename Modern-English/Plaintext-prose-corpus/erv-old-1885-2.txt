<P_4,1G>

And the man knew Eve his wife; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.2

and she conceived, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.3

and bare Cain, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.4

and said, I have gotten a man with <font> the help of <$$font> the Lord.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.5

And again she bare his brother Abel.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.6

And Abel was a keeper of sheep, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.7

but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.8

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit
of the ground an offering unto the Lord.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.9

And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
fat thereof.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.10

And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.11

but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.12

And Cain was very wroth, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.13

and his countenance fell.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.14

And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.15

and why is thy countenance fallen?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.16

If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.17

and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.18

and unto thee shall be his desire, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.19

and thou shalt rule over him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.20

And Cain told Abel his brother.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.21

And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up
against Abel his brother, and slew him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.22

And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.23

And he said, I know not: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.24

am I my brother's keeper?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.25

And he said, What hast thou done?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.26

the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.27

And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to
receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.28

when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
her strength; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.29

a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.30

And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.31

Behold, thou has driven me out this day from the face of the ground;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.32

and from thy face shall I be hid; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.33

and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.34

and it shall come to pass, that whosoever findeth me shall slay me.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.35

And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance
shall be taken on him sevenfold.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.36

And the Lord appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should
smite him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.37

And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.38

and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.39

And Cain knew his wife; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.40

and she conceived, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.41

and bare Enoch: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.42

and he builded a city, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.43

and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.44

and Methushael begat Lamech.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.48

And Lamech took unto him two wives: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.49

the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1G.50

<P_4,20G> And Adah bare Jabal: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.51

he was the father of such as dwell in tents and <font> have <$$font>
cattle.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.52

And his brother's name was Jubal: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.53

he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.54

And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting
instrument of brass and iron: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.55

and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.56

And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.57

Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.58

For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.59

If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.60

And Adam knew his wife again; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.61

and she bare a son, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.62

and called his name Seth: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.63

For, <font> said she, <$$font> God hath appointed me another seed instead
of Abel; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.64

for Cain slew him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.65

And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.66

and he called his name Enosh: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.67

then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20G.68

<P_5,1G> This is the book of the generations of Adam.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1G.69

In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1G.70

male and female created he them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1G.71

ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1G.139

And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1G.140

And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and

Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1G.147

and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, and Resen between

ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1G.150

and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1G.151

And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward
Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and
Zeboiim, unto Lasha.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1G.152

<P_10,20G> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their

and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20G.163

all these were the sons of Joktan.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20G.164

And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the
mountain of the east.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20G.165

These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues,
in their lands, after their nations.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20G.166

These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
in their nations: ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20G.167

and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20G.168

<P_11,1G> And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.169

And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in
the land of Shinar; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.170

and they dwelt there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.171

And they said one to another, Go to, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.172

let us make brick, and burn them throughly {COM:sic}.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.173

And they had brick for stone, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.174

and slime had they for mortar.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.175

And they said, Go to, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.176

let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top <font> may reach <$$font>
unto heaven, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.177

and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of
the whole earth.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.178

And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children
of men builded.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.179

And the Lord said, Behold, they are one people, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.180

and they have all one language; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.181

and this is what they begin to do: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.182

and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.183

Go to, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.184

let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not
understand one another's speech.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.185

So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the
earth: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.186

and they left off to build the city.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.187

Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there
confound the language of all the earth: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.188

and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all
the earth.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.189

These are the generations of Shem.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1G.190

Now these are the generations of Terah.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.225

Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.226

and Haran begat Lot.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.227

And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his
nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.228

And Abram and Nahor took them wives: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.229

the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah,
the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.230

And Sarai was barren; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.231

she had no child.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.232

And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son,
and Sarai his daughter in law, his son $Abram $'s {TEXT:Abram's} wife;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.233

and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the
land of Canaan; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.234

and they came unto Haran, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.235

and dwelt there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.236

And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.237

and Terah died in Haran.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20G.238

<P_15,1G> After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a
vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.239

I am thy shield, <font> and <$$font> thy exceeding great reward.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.240

And Abram said, O Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,
and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.241

And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.242

and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.243

And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This man shall
not be thine heir; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.244

but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.245

And he brought him forth abroad, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.246

and said, Look now toward heaven, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.247

and tell the stars, if thou be able to tell them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.248

and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.249

And he believed in the Lord; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.250

and he counted it to him for righteousness.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.251

And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the
Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.252

And he said, O Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.253

And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat
of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove,
and a young pigeon.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.254

And he took him all these, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.255

and divided them in the midst, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.256

and laid each half over against the other: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.257

but the birds divided he not.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.258

And the birds of prey came down upon the carcases,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.259

and Abram drove them away.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.260

And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.261

and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.262

And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.263

and they shall afflict them four hundred years; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.264

and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.265

and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.266

But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.267

thou shalt be buried in a good old age.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.268

And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.269

for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.270

And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold
a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1G.271

In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed
have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,
the river Euphrates: the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite
, <P_15,20G> and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, and
the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20G.272

<P_16,1G> Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.273

and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.274

And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from
bearing; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.275

go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.276

it may be that I shall obtain children by her.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.277

And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.278

And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.279

and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.280

And he went in unto Hagar, ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.281

and she conceived: ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.282

and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in
her eyes.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.283

And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.284

I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.285

and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.286

the Lord judge between me and thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.287

But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.288

do to her that which is good in thine eyes.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.289

And Sarai dealt hardly with her, ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.290

and she fled from her face.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.291

And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.292

And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.293

and whither goest thou?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.294

And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.295

And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.296

and submit thyself under her hands.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.297

And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed
, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.298

And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.299

and shalt bear a son; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.300

and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the Lord hath heard thy
affliction.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.301

And he shall be <font> as <$$font> a wild-ass among men;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.302

his hand <font> shall be <$$font> against every man, and every man's
hand against him; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.303

and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.304

And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou art a God
that seeth: ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.305

for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.306

Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.307

behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.308

And Hagar bare Abram a son: ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.309

and Abram called the name of his son, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.310

And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael
to Abram.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,16,1G.311

<P_17,1G> And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared
to Abram, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.312

and said unto him, I am God Almighty; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.313

walk before me, and be thou perfect.  And I will make my covenant between
me and thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.314

and will multiply thee exceedingly.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.315

And Abram fell on his face: ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.316

and God talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my covenant is with
thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.317

and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.318

Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.319

but thy name shall be Abraham; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.320

for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.321

And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.322

and I will make nations of thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.323

and kings shall come out of thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.324

And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after
thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.325

And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy
sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.326

and I will be their God.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.327

And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my
covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.328

This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
seed after thee; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.329

every male among you shall be circumcised.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.330

And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.331

and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.332

And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male
throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with
money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.333

He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money,
must needs be circumcised: ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.334

and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.335

And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh
of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.336

he hath broken my covenant.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.337

And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call
her name Sarai, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.338

but Sarah shall her name be.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.339

And I will bless her, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.340

and moreover I will give thee a son of her: ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.341

yea, I will bless her, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.342

and she shall be <font> a mother of <$$font> nations;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.343

kings of peoples shall be of her.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.344

Then Abraham fell upon his face, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.345

and laughed, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.346

and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred
years old?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.347

and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.348

And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.349

And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.350

and thou shalt call his name Isaac: ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.351

and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant
for his seed after him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,1G.352

<P_17,20G> And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.353

behold, I have blessed him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.354

and will make him fruitful, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.355

and will multiply him exceedingly; ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.356

twelve princes shall he beget, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.357

and I will make him a great nation.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.358

But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto
thee at this set time in the next year.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.359

And he left off talking with him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.360

and God went up from Abraham.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.361

And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house,
and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of
Abraham's house, ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.362

and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God
had said unto him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.363

And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in
the flesh of his foreskin.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.364

And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in
the flesh of his foreskin.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.365

In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.366

And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those
bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,17,20G.367

<P_18,1G> And the Lord appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he
sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.368

and he lift up his eyes ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.369

and looked, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.370

and, lo, three men stood over against him: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.371

and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.372

and bowed himself to the earth, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.373

and said, My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away,
I pray thee, from thy servant: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.374

let now a little water be fetched, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.375

and wash your feet, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.376

and rest yourselves under the tree: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.377

and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your heart;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.378

after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.379

And they said, So do, as thou hast said.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.380

And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.381

and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.382

knead it, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.383

and make cakes.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.384

And Abraham ran unto the herd, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.385

and fetched a calf tender and good, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.386

and gave it unto the servant; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.387

and he hasted to dress it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.388

And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.389

and set it before them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.390

and he stood by them under the tree, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.391

and they did eat.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.392

And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.393

And he said, Behold, in the tent.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.394

And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh
round; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.395

and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.396

And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.397

Now Abraham and Sarah were old, <font> and <$$font> well stricken in age;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.398

it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.399

And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I
have pleasure, my lord being old also?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.400

And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.401

Is any thing too hard for the Lord?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.402

At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.403

and Sarah shall have a son.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.404

Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.405

for she was afraid.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.406

And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.407

And the men rose up from thence, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.408

and looked toward Sodom: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.409

and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.410

And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do; seeing
that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the
nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.411

For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and
his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do
justice and judgement; to the end that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
that which he hath spoken of him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1G.412

<P_18,20G> And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now,
and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it,
which is come unto me; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.413

and if not, I will know.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.414

And the men turned from thence, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.415

and went toward Sodom: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.416

but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.417

And Abraham drew near, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.418

and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.419

Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.420

wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that
are therein?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.421

That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.422

that be far from thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.423

shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.424

And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will spare all the place for their sake.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.425

And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak
unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.426

peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.427

wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.428

And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.429

And he spake unto him yet again, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.430

and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.431

And he said, I will not do it for the $forty $'s {TEXT:forty's} sake.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.432

And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.433

and I will speak: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.434

peradventure there shall thirty be found there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.435

And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.436

And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.437

peradventure there shall be twenty found there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.438

And he said, I will not destroy it for the $twenty $'s {TEXT:twenty's}
sake.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.439

And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.440

and I will speak yet but this once: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.441

peradventure ten shall be found there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.442

And he said, I will not destroy it for the $ten $'s {TEXT:ten's} sake.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.443

And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham
: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.444

and Abraham returned unto his place.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20G.445

<P_19,1G> And the two angels came to Sodom at even;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.446

and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.447

and Lot saw them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.448

and rose up to meet them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.449

and he bowed himself with his face to the earth; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.450

and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your
servant's house, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.451

and tarry all night, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.452

and wash your feet, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.453

and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way -.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.454

And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.455

And he urged them greatly; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.456

and they turned in unto him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.457

and entered into his house; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.458

and he made them a feast, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.459

and did bake unleavened bread, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.460

and they did eat.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.461

But before they lay down, the men of the city, <font> even <$$font>
the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all
the people from every quarter; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.462

and they called unto Lot, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.463

and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.464

bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.465

And Lot went out unto them to the door, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.466

and shut the door after him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.467

And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.468

Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.469

let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.470

and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.471

only unto these men do nothing; forasmuch as they are come under the
shadow of my roof.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.472

And they said, Stand back.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.473

And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.474

and he will needs be a judge: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.475

now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.476

And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.477

and drew near to break the door.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.478

But the men put forth their hand, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.479

and brought Lot into the house to them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.480

and shut to the door.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.481

And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness,
both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.482

And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.483

son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast
in the city; bring them out of the place: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.484

for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great
before the Lord; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.485

and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.486

And Lot went out, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.487

and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.488

and said, Up, get you out of this place; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.489

for the Lord will destroy the city.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.490

But he seemed unto his sons in law as one that mocked.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.491

And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.492

take thy wife, and thy two daughters which are here; lest thou be consumed
in the iniquity of the city.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.493

But he lingered; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.494

and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and
upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.495

and they brought him forth, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.496

and set him without the city.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.497

And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he
said, Escape for thy life; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.498

look not behind thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.499

neither stay thou in all the Plain; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.500

escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.501

And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.502

behold now, thy servant has found grace in thy sight,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.503

and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in
saving my life; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.504

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake
me, and I die: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1G.505

<P_19,20G> behold now, this city is near to flee unto,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.506

and it is a little one: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.507

Oh, let me escape thither, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.508

<paren> is it not a little one?  <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.509

and my soul shall live.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.510

And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing
also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou has spoken.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.511

Haste thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.512

escape thither; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.513

for I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do any thing till thou be come thither.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.514

Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.515

The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.516

Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
from the Lord out of heaven; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.517

and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.518

But his wife looked back from behind him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.519

and she became a pillar of salt.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.520

And Abraham gat {COM:sic} up early in the morning to the place where he
had stood before the Lord: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.521

and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
Plain, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.522

and beheld, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.523

and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.524

And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that
God remembered Abraham, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.525

and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the
cities in the which Lot dwelt.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.526

And Lot went up out of Zoar, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.527

and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.528

for he feared to dwell in Zoar: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.529

and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.530

And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.531

and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner
of all the earth: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.532

come, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.533

let us make our father drink wine, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.534

and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.535

And they made their father drink wine that night:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.536

and the firstborn went in, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.537

and lay with her father; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.538

and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.539

And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.540

let us make him drink wine this night also; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.541

and go thou in, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.542

and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.543

And they made their father drink wine that night also:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.544

and the younger arose, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.545

and lay with him; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.546

and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.547

Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.548

And the firstborn bare a son, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.549

and called his name Moab: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.550

the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.551

And the younger, she also bare a son, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.552

and called his name Ben-ammi: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.553

the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20G.554

<P_20,1G> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South
, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.555

and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.556

and he sojourned in Gerar.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.557

And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.558

and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.559

and took Sarah.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.560

But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.561

and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman
which thou hast taken; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.562

for she is a man's wife.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.563

Now Abimelech had not come near her: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.564

and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.565

Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.566

and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.567

in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I
done this.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.568

And God said to him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of
thy heart thou hast done this, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.569

and I also withheld thee from sinning against me: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.570

therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.571

Now therefore restore the man's wife; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.572

for he is a prophet, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.573

and he shall pray for thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.574

and thou shalt live: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.575

and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
and all that are thine.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.576

And Abimelech rose early in the morning, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.577

and called all his servants, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.578

and told all these things in their ears: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.579

and the men were sore afraid.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.580

Then Abimelech called Abraham, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.581

and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.582

and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me
and on my kingdom a great sin?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.583

thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.584

And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done
this thing?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.585

And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this
place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.586

And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but
not the daughter of my mother; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.587

and she became my wife: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.588

and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house,
that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto
me; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.589

at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.590

And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and menservants and womenservants,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.591

and gave them unto Abraham, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.592

and restored him Sarah his wife.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.593

And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.594

dwell where it pleaseth thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.595

And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
pieces of silver: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.596

behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee
; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.597

and in respect of all thou art righted.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.598

And Abraham prayed unto God: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.599

and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.600

and they bare children.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.601

For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,
because of Sarah Abraham's wife.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1G.602

<P_21,1G> And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.603

and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.604

And Sarah conceived, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.605

and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had
spoken to him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.606

And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom
Sarah bare to him, Isaac.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.607

And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as
God had commanded him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.608

And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
unto him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.609

And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.610

every one that heareth will laugh with me.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.611

And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give
children suck?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.612

for I have borne him a son in his old age.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.613

And the child grew ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.614

and was weaned: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.615

and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.616

And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto
Abraham, mocking.  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this
bondwoman and her son: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.617

for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even
with Isaac.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.618

And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.619

And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because
of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.620

in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.621

for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.622

And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he
is thy seed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.623

And Abraham rose up early in the morning, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.624

and took bread and a bottle of water, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.625

and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.626

and sent her away: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.627

and she departed, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.628

and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.629

And the water in the bottle was spent, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.630

and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.631

And she went, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.632

and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.633

for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.634

And she sat over against him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.635

and lift up her voice, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.636

and wept.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.637

And God heard the voice of the lad; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.638

and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.639

and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.640

fear not; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.641

for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.642

Arise, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.643

lift up the lad, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.644

and hold him in thine hand; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.645

for I will make him a great nation.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.646

And God opened her eyes, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.647

and she saw a well of water; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.648

and she went, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.649

and filled the bottle with water, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.650

and gave the lad drink.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,1G.651

<P_21,20G> And God was with the lad, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.652

and he grew; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.653

and he dwelt in the wilderness, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.654

and became an archer.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.655

And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.656

and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.657

And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain
of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that
thou doest: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.658

now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely
with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.659

but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.660

And Abraham said, I will swear.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.661

And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which
Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.662

And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.663

neither didst thou tell me, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.664

neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.665

And Abraham took sheep and oxen, ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.666

and gave them unto Abimelech; ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.667

and they two made a covenant.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.668

And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.669

And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which
thou hast set by themselves?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.670

And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.671

Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both
of them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.672

So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.673

and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.674

and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.675

And <font> Abraham <$$font> planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.676

and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.677

And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,21,20G.678

<P_15,1N>

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.680

and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations,
which I give unto you, and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord,
a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill
offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the Lord,
of the herd, or of the flock: then shall he that offereth his oblation
offer unto the Lord a meal offering of a tenth part <font> of an ephah
<$$font> of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.681

and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of an hin, shalt thou
prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.682

Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts
<font> of an ephah <$$font> of fine flour mingled with the third part
of an hin of oil: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.683

and for the drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of
wine, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.684

And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings unto the Lord :
then shall he offer with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth parts
<font> of an ephah <$$font> of fine flour mingled with half an hin of oil.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.685

And thou shalt offer for the drink offering half an hin of wine,
for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.686

Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of
the he-lambs, or of the kids.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.687

According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every
one according to their number.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.688

All that are homeborn shall do these things after this manner, in
offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.689

And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you throughout
your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the Lord; as ye do, so he shall do.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.690

For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger
that sojourneth <font> with you, <$$font> a statute for ever throughout
your generations: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.691

as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.692

One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that
sojourneth with you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.693

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.694

and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, then
it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer
up an heave offering unto the Lord.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,1N.695

<P_15,20N> Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for an
heave offering: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.696

as ye do the heave offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.697

Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave offering
throughout your generations.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.698

And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which
the Lord hath spoken unto Moses, even all that the Lord hath commanded
you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord gave commandment
, and onward throughout your generations; then it shall be, if it be
done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all
the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering,
for a sweet savour unto the Lord, with the meal offering thereof, and
the drink offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat
for a sin offering.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.699

And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the
children of Israel, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.700

and they shall be forgiven; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.701

for it was an error, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.702

and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto
the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord, for their error:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.703

and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven,
and the stranger that sojourneth among them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.704

for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.705

And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat of
the first year for a sin offering.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.706

And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when
he sinneth unwittingly, before the Lord, to make atonement for him;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.707

and he shall be forgiven.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.708

Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him
that is homeborn among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that
sojourneth among them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.709

But the soul that doeth aught with an high hand, whether he be homeborn
or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord; ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.710

and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.711

Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his
commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.712

his iniquity shall be upon him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.713

And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a
man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.714

And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron,
and unto all the congregation.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.715

And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should
be done to him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.716

And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.717

all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.718

And all the congregation brought him without the camp,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.719

and stoned him with stones, ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.720

and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.721

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.722

and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments
throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each
border a cord of blue: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,20N.723

and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and
remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go
not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to
go a whoring: <P_15,40N> that ye may remember and do all my commandments,
and be holy unto your God.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,40N.724

I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt,
to be your God: ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,40N.725

I am the Lord your God.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,15,40N.726

<P_18,1N> And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
fathers'house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.727

and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your
priesthood.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.728

And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring
thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister
unto thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.729

but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.730

And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.731

only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary
and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.732

And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of
meeting, for all the service of the Tent: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.733

and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.734

And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
the altar: that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.735

And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the
children of Israel: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.736

to you they are a gift, given unto the Lord, to do the service of the
tent of meeting.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.737

And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for every
thing of the altar, and for that within the veil; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.738

and ye shall serve: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.739

I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.740

and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.741

And the Lord spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the
charge of mine heave offerings, even all the hallowed things of the
children of Israel, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.742

unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons,
as a due for ever.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.743

This shall be thine of the most holy things, <font> reserved <$$font>
from the fire: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.744

every oblation of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every
sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they
shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.745

As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.746

every male shall eat thereof; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.747

it shall be holy unto thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.748

And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, even all the wave
offerings of the children of Israel: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.749

I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
thee, as a due for ever: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.750

every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.751

All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the
corn, the firstfruits of them which they give unto the Lord, to thee
have I given them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.752

The firstripe {COM:sic} fruits of all that is in their land, which they
bring unto the Lord, shall be thine; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.753

every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.754

Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.755

Every thing that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto
the Lord, both of man and beast, shall be thine: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.756

nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.757

and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.758

And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou
redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,
after the shekel of the sanctuary ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.759

<paren> the same is twenty gerahs <$$paren>.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.760

But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling
of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.761

they are holy: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.762

thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.763

and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour
unto the Lord.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.764

And the flesh of them shall be thine, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.765

as the wave breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.766

All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel
offer unto the Lord, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters
with thee, as a due for ever: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.767

it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy
seed with thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,1N.768

<P_18,20N> And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
in their land, ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.769

neither shalt thou have any portion among them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.770

I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.771

And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in
Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve,
even the service of the tent of meeting.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.772

And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of
meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.773

But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.774

and they shall bear their iniquity: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.775

it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.776

and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.777

For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave
offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.778

therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall
have no inheritance.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.779

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Moreover thou shalt speak unto
the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel
the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye
shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord, a tithe of the tithe.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.780

And your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were
the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.781

Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of
all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.782

and thereof you shall give the Lord's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.783

Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord,
of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.784

Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best
thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the
increase of the threshing-floor, and as increase of the winepress.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.785

And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.786

for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.787

And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it
the best thereof: ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.788

and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,
that ye die not.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,18,20N.789

<P_19,1N> And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, This is
the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying, Speak unto
the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot,
wherein is no blemish, <font> and <$$font> upon which never came yoke:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.790

and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.791

and he shall bring her forth without the camp, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.792

and one shall slay her before his face: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.793

and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and
sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.794

and one shall burn the heifer in his sight; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.795

her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.796

and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast
it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.797

Then the priest shall wash his clothes, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.798

and he shall bathe his flesh in water, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.799

and afterward he shall come into the camp, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.800

and the priest shall be unclean until the even.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.801

And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his
flesh in water, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.802

and shall be unclean until the even.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.803

And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and
lay them up without the camp in a clean place, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.804

and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for
a water of separation: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.805

it is a sin offering.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.806

And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.807

and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that
sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.808

He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.809

the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.810

and on the seventh day he shall be clean: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.811

but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he
shall not be clean.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.812

Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth
not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.813

and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.814

because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be
unclean; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.815

his uncleanness is yet upon him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.816

This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.817

every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent,
shall be unclean seven days.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.818

And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.819

And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword
, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean
seven days.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.820

And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the
sin offering, ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.821

and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.822

and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and
sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons
that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain,
or the dead, or the grave: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.823

and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day,
and on the seventh day: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.824

and on the seventh day he shall purify him; ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.825

and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.826

and shall be clean at even.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,1N.827

<P_19,20N> But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not
purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of
the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.828

the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.829

he is unclean.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.830

And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.831

and he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.832

and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.833

And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.834

and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,19,20N.835

<P_20,1N> And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came
into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.836

and the people abode in Kadesh; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.837

and Miriam died there, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.838

and was buried there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.839

And there was no water for the congregation: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.840

and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.841

And the people strove with Moses, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.842

and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethen died
before the Lord!  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.843

And why have ye brought the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness,
that we should die there, we and our cattle?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.844

And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in
unto this evil place?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.845

it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.846

neither is there any water to drink.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.847

And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door
of the tent of meeting, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.848

and fell upon their faces: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.849

and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.850

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying Take the rod,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.851

and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.852

and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its
water; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.853

and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.854

so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.855

And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.856

And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.857

and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.858

shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.859

And Moses lifted up his hand, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.860

and smote the rock with his rod twice: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.861

and water came forth abundantly, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.862

and the congregation drank, and their cattle.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.863

And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me
, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye
shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.864

These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove
with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.865

And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.866

Thus saith thy brother Israel, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.867

Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: how our fathers went
down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians
evil entreated us, and our fathers: and when we cried unto the Lord, he
heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.868

and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border :
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.869

let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.870

we will not pass through field or through vineyard,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.871

neither will we drink of the water of the wells: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.872

we will go along the king's <font> high <$$font> way,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.873

we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have
passed thy border.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.874

And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out
with the sword against thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.875

And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the high way:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.876

and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the
price thereof: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.877

let me only, without <font> doing <$$font> any thing <font> else, <$$font>
pass through on my feet.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,1N.878

<P_20,20N> And he said, Thou shalt not pass through.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.879

And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.880

Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore
Israel turned away from him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.881

And they journeyed from Kadesh: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.882

and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto
mount Hor.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.883

And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border
of the land of Edom, saying, Aaron shall be gathered unto his people:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.884

for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children
of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.885

Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.886

and bring them up unto mount Hor: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.887

and strip Aaron of his garments, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.888

and put them upon Eleazar his son: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.889

and Aaron shall be gathered <font> unto his people, <$$font>
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.890

and shall die there.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.891

And Moses did as the Lord commanded: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.892

and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.893

And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.894

and put them upon Eleazar his son; ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.895

and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.896

and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.897

And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron
thirty days, even all the House of Israel.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,20,20N.898

<P_1,1D>

<heading>

The Fifth Book of Moses, commonly called Deuteronomy.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.901

<$$heading>

These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond Jordan in the
wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel ,
and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.903

It is eleven days'<font> journey <$$font> from Horeb by the way of mount
Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.904

And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the
first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them;
after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.905

beyond Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law ,
saying, The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
long enough in this mountain: ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.906

turn you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.907

and take your journey, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.908

and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and unto all <font> the
places <$$font> nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and
in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea shore, the land of the
Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.909

Behold, I have set the land before you: ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.910

go in ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.911

and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.912

And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
myself alone: ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.913

the Lord your God hath multiplied you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.914

and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.915

The Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many
more as ye are, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.916

and bless you, as he hath promised you!  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.917

How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your
strife?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.918

Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes,
and I will make them heads over you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.919

And ye answered me, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.920

and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good <font> for us <$$font>
to do.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.921

So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.922

and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of
hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers,
according to your tribes.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.923

And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear <font> the causes
<$$font> between your brethren, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.924

and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger
that is with him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.925

Ye shall not respect persons in judgement; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.926

ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.927

ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.928

for the judgement is God's: ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.929

and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.930

and I will hear it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.931

And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.932

And we journeyed from Horeb, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.933

and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw,
by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God
commanded us; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.934

and we came to Kadesh-barnea.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,1D.935

<P_1,20D> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill country of the
Amorites, which the Lord our God giveth unto us.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.936

Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.937

go up, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.938

take possession, as the Lord, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto
thee; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.939

fear not, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.940

neither be dismayed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.941

And ye came near unto me every one of you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.942

and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for
us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the
cities unto which we shall come.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.943

And the thing pleased me well: ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.944

and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.945

and they turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.946

and went up into the mountain, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.947

and came unto the valley of Eshcol, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.948

and spied it out.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.949

And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.950

and brought it down unto us, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.951

and brought us word again, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.952

and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God giveth unto us.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.953

Yet ye would not go up, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.954

but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.955

and ye murmured in your tents, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.956

and said, Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the
land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.957

Whither are we going up?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.958

our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people is greater
and taller than we; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.959

the cities are great and fenced up to heaven; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.960

and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.961

Then I said unto you, Dread not, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.962

neither be afraid of them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.963

The Lord your God who goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; and in
the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee,
as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came
unto this place.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.964

Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God, who went before
you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire
by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, in the cloud by day.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.965

And the Lord heard the voice of your words, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.966

and was wroth, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.967

and sware, saying, Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.968

he shall see it; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.969

and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon,
and to his children: because he hath wholly followed the Lord.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.970

Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt
not go in thither: ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.971

Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.972

encourage thou him; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.973

for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.974

Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your
children, which this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall
go in thither, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.975

and unto them will I give it, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.976

and they shall possess it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,20D.977

<P_1,40D> But as for you, turn you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.978

and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.979

Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.980

we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God
commanded us.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.981

And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.982

and were forward to go up into the mountain.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.983

And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.984

neither fight; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.985

for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.986

So I spake unto you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.987

and ye hearkened not; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.988

but ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.989

and were presumptuous, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.990

and went up into the mountain.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.991

And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.992

and chased you, as bees do, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.993

and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.994

And ye returned ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.995

and wept before the Lord; ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.996

but the Lord hearkened not to your voice, ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.997

nor gave ear unto you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.998

So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode
<font> there <$$font>.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,1,40D.999

<P_2,1D> Then we turned, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1000

and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea,
as the Lord spake unto me: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1001

and we compassed mount Seir many days.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1002

And the Lord spake unto me, saying, Ye have compassed this mountain long
enough: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1003

turn you northward.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1004

And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the
border of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1005

and they shall be afraid of you: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1006

take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1007

contend not with them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1008

for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole
of the foot to tread on: because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for
a possession.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1009

Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1010

and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1011

For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1012

he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1013

these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1014

thou hast lacked nothing.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1015

So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1016

And we turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1017

and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1018

And the Lord said unto me, Vex not Moab, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1019

neither contend with them in battle: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1020

for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because
I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1021

<paren> The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many,
and tall, as the Anakim: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1022

these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1023

but the Moabites call them Emim.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1024

The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1025

but the children of Esau succeeded them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1026

and they destroyed them from before them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1027

and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession,
which the Lord gave unto them.  <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1028

Now rise up, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1029

and get you over the brook Zered.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1030

And we went over the brook Zered.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1031

And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over
the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation
of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the Lord
sware unto them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1032

Moreover, the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from
the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1033

So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from
among the people, that the Lord spake unto me, saying, Thou art this
day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1034

and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them
not, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1035

nor contend with them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1036

for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for
a possession: because I have given it unto the children of Lot for
a possession.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,1D.1037

<P_2,20D> <paren> That also is accounted a land of Rephaim:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1038

Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1039

but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim; a people great, and many, and tall,
as the Anakim; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1040

but the Lord destroyed them before them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1041

and they succeeded them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1042

and dwelt in their stead: as he did for the children of Esau, which
dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1043

and they succeeded them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1044

and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1045

and the Avvim which dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim,
which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1046

and dwelt in their stead.  <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1047

Rise ye up, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1048

take your journey, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1049

and pass over the valley of Arnon: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1050

behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon ,
and his land: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1051

begin to possess it, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1052

and contend with him in battle.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1053

This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee
upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the
report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1054

And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king
of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, Let me pass through thy land:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1055

I will go along by the high way, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1056

I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1057

Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water
for money, that I may drink: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1058

only let me pass through on my feet; as the children of Esau which
dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I
shall pass over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1059

But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1060

for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1061

and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand,
as at this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1062

And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and
his land before thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1063

begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1064

Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle
at Jahaz.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1065

And the Lord our God delivered him up before us; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1066

and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1067

And we took all his cities at that time, ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1068

and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little
ones; ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1069

we left none remaining: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1070

only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of
the cities which we had taken.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1071

From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and <font>
from <$$font> the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there
was not a city too high for us: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1072

the Lord our God delivered up all before us: ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1073

only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1074

all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country,
and wheresoever the Lord our God forbad us.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,2,20D.1075

<P_3,1D> Then we turned, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1076

and went up the way to Bashan: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1077

and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people,
unto battle at Edrei.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1078

And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1079

for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy
hand; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1080

and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
which dwelt at Heshbon.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1081

So the Lord our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan,
and all his people: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1082

and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1083

And we took all his cities at that time; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1084

there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore
cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1085

All these were cities fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside
the unwalled towns a great many.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1086

And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,
utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little
ones.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1087

But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey
unto ourselves.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1088

And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
the Amorites that were beyond Jordan, from the valley of Arnon unto mount
Hermon; <paren> <font> which <$$font> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion,
and the Amorites call it Senir; <$$paren> all the cities of the plain,
and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the
kingdom of Og in Bashan.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1089

<paren> For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim
; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1090

behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1091

is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1092

nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it,
after the cubit of a man.  <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1093

And this land we took in possession at that time: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1094

from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country
of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to
the Gadites: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1095

and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto
the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1096

<paren> The same is called the land of Rephaim.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1097

Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border
of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1098

and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto
this day.  <$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1099

And I gave Gilead unto Machir.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1100

And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto
the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border <font>
thereof <$$font>; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of
the children of Ammon; the Arabah also, and Jordan and the border <font>
thereof <$$font>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the
Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1101

And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given
you this land to possess it: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1102

ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel,
all the men of valour.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,1D.1103

But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, <paren> I know
that ye have much cattle, <$$paren> shall abide in your cities which I
have given you; <P_3,20D> until the Lord give rest unto your brethren
, as unto you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God
giveth them beyond Jordan: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1104

then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have
given you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1105

And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1106

so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1107

Ye shall not fear them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1108

for the Lord your God, he it is that fighteth for you.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1109

And I besought the Lord at that time, saying, O Lord God, thou
hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1110

for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to
thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1111

Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan,
that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1112

But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1113

and hearkened not unto me: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1114

and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1115

speak no more unto me of this matter.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1116

Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1117

and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and
eastward, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1118

and behold with thine eyes: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1119

for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1120

But charge Joshua, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1121

and encourage him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1122

and strengthen him: ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1123

for he shall go over before this people, ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1124

and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1125

So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,3,20D.1126

<P_4,1D> And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the
judgements, which I teach you, for to do them; that ye may live, and
go in and possess the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers,
giveth you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1127

Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1128

neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of
the Lord your God which I command you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1129

Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1130

for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed
them from the midst of thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1131

But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of
you this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1132

Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgements, even as the Lord my
God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither
ye go in to possess it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1133

Keep therefore and do them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1134

for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples
, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation
is a wise and understanding people.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1135

For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as
the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon him?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1136

And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and judgements
so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1137

Only take heed to thyself, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1138

and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine
eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life ;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1139

but make them known unto thy children and thy children's children; the
day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord
said unto me, Assemble me the people, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1140

and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all
the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their
children.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1141

And ye came near ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1142

and stood under the mountain; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1143

and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness
, cloud, and thick darkness.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1144

And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1145

ye heard the voice of words, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1146

but ye saw no form; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1147

only <font> ye heard <$$font> a voice.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1148

And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform ,
even the ten commandments; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1149

and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1150

And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgements, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
possess it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1151

Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1152

for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the Lord spake unto you
in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: lest ye corrupt yourselves, and
make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male
or female, the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven, the likeness of any thing
that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the
water under the earth: and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and
when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of
heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which the
Lord thy God hath divided unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,1D.1153

<P_4,20D> But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of
the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance,
as at this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1154

Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1155

and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
go in unto that good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
inheritance: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1156

but I must die in this land, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1157

I must not go over Jordan: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1158

but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1159

Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord
your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in
the form of any thing which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1160

For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1161

When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall
have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a
graven image in the form of any thing, and shall do that which is evil
in the sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger: I call heaven
and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly
perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1162

ye shall not prolong your days upon it, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1163

but shall utterly be destroyed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1164

And the Lord shall scatter you among the peoples,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1165

and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither the Lord
shall lead you away.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1166

And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1167

But if from thence ye shall seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him
, if thou search after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1168

When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee,
in the latter days thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and hearken
unto his voice: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1169

for the Lord thy God is a merciful God; ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1170

he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of
thy fathers which he sware unto them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1171

For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since
the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end
of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been <font> any such
thing <$$font> as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1172

Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the
fire, as thou hast heard, and live?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1173

Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of <font>
another <$$font> nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and
by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great
terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt
before your eyes?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1174

Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1175

there is none else beside him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1176

Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct
thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1177

and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1178

and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1179

And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after
them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1180

and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of
Egypt; to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than
thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance,
as at this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1181

Know therefore this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is
God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1182

there is none else.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,20D.1183

<P_4,40D> And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments , which
I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy
children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land,
which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1184

Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan toward the sunrising
{COM:sic}; that the manslayer might flee thither, which slayeth his
neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing
unto one of these cities he might live: <font> namely, <$$font> Bezer
in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth
in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1185

And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1186

these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgements, which
Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of
Egypt; beyond Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the
land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses
and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1187

and they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan
, the two kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan toward the
sunrising {COM:sic}; from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of
Arnon, even unto mount Sion <paren> the same is Hermon <$$paren> , and
all the Arabah beyond Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah,
under the slopes of Pisgah.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,4,40D.1188

<P_5,1D> And Moses called unto all Israel, ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1189

and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the judgements which
I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to
do them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1190

The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1191

The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us,
who are all of us here alive this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1192

The Lord spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of
the fire, <paren> I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to
shew you the word of the Lord: for ye were afraid because of the fire,
and went not up into the mount; <$$paren> saying, I am the Lord thy God,
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1193

Thou shalt have none other gods before me.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1194

Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, <font> the likeness of
<$$font> any form that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1195

thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1196

for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth
generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands,
of them that love me and keep my commandments.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1197

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1198

for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1199

Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord thy God commanded
thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1200

Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1201

but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1202

<font> in it <$$font> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son,
nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox,
nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1203

And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
and the Lord thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by a
stretched out arm: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1204

therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1205

Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commanded thee:
that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, upon the
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1206

Thou shalt do no murder.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1207

Neither shalt thou commit adultery.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1208

Neither shalt thou steal.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,1D.1209

<P_5,20D>

Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1211

Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's wife; ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1212

neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that
is thy neighbour's.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1213

These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of
the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a
great voice: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1214

and he added no more.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1215

And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1216

and gave them unto me.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1217

And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came
near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1218

and ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his
greatness, ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1219

and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1220

we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1221

Now therefore why should we die?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1222

for this great fire will consume us: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1223

if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1224

For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living
God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1225

Go thou near, ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1226

and hear all that the Lord our God shall say: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1227

and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1228

and we will hear it, and do it.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1229

And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1230

and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this
people, which they have spoken unto thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1231

they have well said all that they have spoken.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1232

Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,
and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,
and with their children for ever!  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1233

Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1234

But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the
commandment, and the statutes, and the judgements, which thou shalt teach
them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1235

Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1236

ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1237

Ye shall walk in all the way which the Lord your God hath commanded
you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and
that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,5,20D.1238

<P_6,1D> Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgements,
which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them
in the land whither ye go over to possess it: that thou mightest fear
the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which
I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of
thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1239

Hear therefore, O Israel, ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1240

and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may
increase mightily, as the Lord, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto
thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1241

Hear, O Israel: ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1242

the Lord our God is one Lord: ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1243

and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1244

And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1245

and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1246

and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1247

And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1248

and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1249

And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon
thy gates.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1250

And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land
which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
to give thee; great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not, and
houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns
hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou
plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full; then beware lest thou
forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt,
out of the house of bondage.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1251

Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1252

and him shalt thou serve, ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1253

and shalt swear by his name.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1254

Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples which are
round about you; ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1255

for the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the
anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee
from off the face of the earth.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1256

Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1257

Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God,
and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1258

And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the
Lord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to thrust
out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,1D.1259

<P_6,20D> When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean
the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgements, which the Lord
our God hath commanded you?  then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were
Pharoah's bondmen in Egypt; ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1260

and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1261

and the Lord shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1262

and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give
us the land which he sware unto our fathers.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1263

And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our
God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1264

And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all
this commandment before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,6,20D.1265

<P_7,1D> When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee,
the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and
the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater
and mightier than thou; and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them up
before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy
them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1266

thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1267

neither shalt thou make marriages with them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1268

thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1269

nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1270

For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve
other gods: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1271

so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1272

and he will destroy thee quickly.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1273

But thus shall ye deal with them; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1274

ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars,
and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1275

For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1276

the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto
himself, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1277

The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were
more in number than any people; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1278

for ye were the fewest of all peoples: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1279

but because the Lord loveth you, and because he would keep the oath
which he sware unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with
a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the
hand of Pharoah king of Egypt.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1280

Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God; the faithful God,
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand generations; and repayeth them that hate him
to their face, to destroy them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1281

he will not be slack to him that hateth him, ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1282

he will repay him to his face.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1283

Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes,
and the judgements, which I command thee this day, to do them.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1284

And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these judgements , and
keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God shall keep with thee the covenant
and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1285

and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1286

he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy
corn and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy kine and the young
of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1287

Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1288

there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1289

And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1290

and he will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,
upon thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1291

but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1292

And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the Lord thy God shall
deliver unto thee; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1293

thine eye shall not pity them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1294

neither shalt thou serve their gods; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1295

for that will be a snare unto thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1296

If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;
how can I dispossess them?  thou shalt not be afraid of them:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1297

thou shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and
unto all Egypt; the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the
signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1298

so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,1D.1299

<P_7,20D> Moreover the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them,
until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1300

Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1301

for the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1302

And the Lord thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little
and little: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1303

thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field
increase upon thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1304

But the Lord thy God shall deliver them up before thee,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1305

and shall discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be
destroyed.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1306

And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1307

and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1308

there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have
destroyed them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1309

The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1310

thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take
it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1311

for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1312

and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, and become a
devoted thing like unto it: ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1313

thou shalt utterly detest it, ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1314

and thou shalt utterly abhor it; ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1315

for it is a devoted thing.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,7,20D.1316

<P_8,1D> All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye
observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess
the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1317

And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God hath led
thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee,
to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest
keep his commandments, or no.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1318

And he humbled thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1319

and suffered thee to hunger, ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1320

and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only
, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth
man live.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1321

Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1322

neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1323

And thou shalt consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son,
so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1324

And thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk in
his ways, and to fear him.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1325

For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of
water, of fountains and depths, springing forth in valleys and hills;
a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates;
a land of oil {TEXT:missing_comma} olives and honey; a land wherein
thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing
in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest
dig brass.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1326

And thou shalt eat and be full, ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1327

and thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath
given thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1328

Beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments
, and his judgements, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses,
and dwelt therein; and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy
silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied
; then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God,
which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage; who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness,
wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where
was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not;
that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good
at thy latter end: and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might
of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1329

But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1330

for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may
establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1331

And it shall be, if thou shalt forget the Lord thy God, and walk after
other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this
day that ye shall surely perish.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,1D.1332

<P_8,20G> As the nations which the Lord maketh to perish before you,
so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the
Lord your God.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,8,20G.1333

<P_9,1D> Hear, O Israel: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1334

thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations
greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven
, a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest,
and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1335

Know therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over
before thee as a devouring fire; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1336

he shall destroy them, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1337

and he shall bring them down before thee: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1338

so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the
Lord hath spoken unto thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1339

Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath thrust
them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord
hath brought me in to possess this land: whereas for the wickedness
of these nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1340

Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,
dost thou go in to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these
nations that the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and
that he may establish the word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers,
to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1341

Know therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to
possess it for thy righteousness; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1342

for thou art a stiffnecked people.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1343

Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath
in the wilderness: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1344

from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until
ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Lord.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1345

Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1346

and the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1347

When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even
the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I abode
in the mount forty days and forty nights; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1348

I did neither eat bread nor drink water.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1349

And the Lord delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the
finger of God; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1350

and on them <font> was written <$$font> according to all the words,
which the Lord spake with you in the mount of the midst of the fire in
the day of the assembly.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1351

And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the
Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1352

And the Lord said unto me, Arise, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1353

get thee down quickly from hence; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1354

for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted
themselves; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1355

they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1356

they have made them a molten image.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1357

Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1358

and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1359

let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from
under heaven: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1360

and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1361

So I turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1362

and came down from the mount, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1363

and the mount burned with fire: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1364

and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1365

And I looked, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1366

and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1367

ye had made you a molten calf: ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1368

ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded
you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1369

And I took hold of the two tables, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1370

and cast them out of my two hands, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1371

and brake them before your eyes.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1372

And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty
nights; ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1373

I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which
ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, to
provoke him to anger.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1374

For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord
was wroth against you to destroy you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1375

But the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,1D.1376

<P_9,20D> And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1377

and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1378

And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1379

and burnt it with fire, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1380

and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1381

and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the
mount.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1382

And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked
the Lord to wrath.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1383

And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess
the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment
of the Lord your God, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1384

and ye believed him not, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1385

nor hearkened to his voice.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1386

Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1387

So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights
that I fell down; because the Lord had said he would destroy you.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1388

And I prayed unto the Lord, ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1389

and said, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance,
which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou has brought
forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1390

Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1391

look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness
, nor to their sin: lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say
, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he
promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out
to slay them in the wilderness.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1392

Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
broughtest out by thy great power and by thy stretched out arm.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,9,20D.1393

<P_10,1D> At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
stone like unto the first, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1394

and come up unto me into the mount, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1395

and make thee an ark of wood.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1396

And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables
which thou brakest, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1397

and thou shalt put them in the ark.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1398

So I made an ark of acacia wood, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1399

and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1400

and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1401

And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten
commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the
midst of the fire in the day of assembly: ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1402

and the Lord gave them unto me.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1403

And I turned ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1404

and came down from the mount, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1405

and put the tables in the ark which I had made; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1406

and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1407

<paren> And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Benejaakan to
Moserah: ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1408

there Aaron died, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1409

and there he was buried; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1410

and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1411

From thence they journyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah,
a land of brooks of water.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1412

At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of
the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him,
and to bless in his name, unto this day.  Wherefore Levi hath no portion
nor inheritance with his brethren; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1413

the Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God spake unto him.
<$$paren> ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1414

And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty
nights: ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1415

and the Lord hearkened unto me that time also; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1416

the Lord would not destroy thee.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1417

And the Lord said unto me, Arise, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1418

take thy journey before the people; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1419

and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their
fathers to give unto them.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1420

And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear
the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve
the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, to keep the
commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this
day for thy good?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1421

Behold, unto the Lord thy God belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of
heavens, the earth, with all that therein is.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1422

Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1423

and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at
this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1424

Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1425

and be no more stiffnecked.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1426

For the Lord your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great
God, the mighty, and the terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor
taketh reward.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1427

He doth execute the judgement of the fatherless and the widow,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1428

and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1429

Love ye therefore the stranger: ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1430

for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,1D.1431

<P_10,20D> Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1432

him shalt thou serve; ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1433

and to him shalt thou cleave, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1434

and by his name shalt thou swear.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1435

He is thy praise, ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1436

and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible
things, which thine eyes have seen.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1437

Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1438

and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for
multitude.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,10,20D.1439

<P_11,1D> Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge,
and his statutes, and his judgements, and his commandments, alway.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1440

And know ye this day: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1441

for <font> I speak <$$font> not with your children which have not known
, and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, his
greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, and his signs ,
and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king
of Egypt, and unto all his land; and what he did unto the army of Egypt,
unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the
Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the Lord
hath destroyed them unto this day: and what he did unto you in the
wilderness, until ye came unto this place; and what he did unto Dathan
and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened
her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents,
and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1442

but your eyes have seen all the great work of the Lord which he did.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1443

Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment {COM:sic} which I command
thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land ,
whither ye go over to possess it; and that ye may prolong your days upon
the land, which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to
their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1444

For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of
Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst
it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1445

but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and
valleys, <font> ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1446

and <$$font> drinketh water of the rain of heaven: a land which the Lord
thy God careth for; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1447

the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of
the year even unto the end of the year.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1448

And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God,
and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I
will give the rain of your land in its season, and the former rain and
the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine,
and thine oil.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1449

And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1450

and thou shalt eat and be full.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1451

Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside
, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be
kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain,
and that the land yield not her fruit: and ye perish quickly from off
the good land which the Lord giveth you.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1452

Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul
; ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1453

and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand,
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1454

and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1455

And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest
in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest
down, and when thou risest up.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,1D.1456

<P_11,20D> And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine
house, and upon thy gates; that your days may be multiplied, and the
days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware unto your
fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1457

For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command
you, to do it; to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and
to cleave unto him; then will the Lord drive out all these nations from
before you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1458

and ye shall possess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1459

Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours:
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1460

from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates,
even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1461

There shall no man be able to stand before you: ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1462

the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1463

Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; the blessing,
if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the Lord your God, which
I command you this day: and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the
commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside out of the way which
I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1464

And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God shall bring thee
into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt
set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1465

Are they not beyond Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun,
in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the Arabah, over against
Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1466

For ye are to pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the
Lord your God giveth you, ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1467

and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1468

And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the judgements which I
set before you this day.  ERV-OLD-1885-2,11,20D.1469
