Notes upon the Book of John.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.3

Chap. I.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.4

<$$heading>

The Word was in the Beginning, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.6

and it was with God, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.7

nay the Word was God.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.8

He himself was with God in the Beginning.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.9

All Things were made by him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.10

and without him there was not one Thing made which was made.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.11

In him there was Life, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.12

and that was the Light of Men.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.13

And the Light shined in Darkness, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.14

but the Darkness did not perceive it.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.15

There was a Man sent from God, whose Name was John.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.16

He himself came for a Witness, that he might testify concerning the Light,
for all to believe by it.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.17

He was not that Light, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.18

but was to testify concerning the Light; Which was the true
Light, that enlightens every Person who comes into the World.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.19

He was in the World, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.20

and it was made by him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.21

yet that did not know him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.22

He came to his own, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.23

and they did not receive him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.24

But to them whoever received him, he gave Authority to become the
Children of God, to those that believed in his Name: Who were born,
not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man,
but of God.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.25

And the Word became Flesh, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.26

and dwelt among us <paren> so that we saw his Glory, the Glory as of
the only begotten one of the Father <$$paren> full of Grace and Truth.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.27

John testified concerning him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.28

and cried out, as follows; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.29

This was he of whom I spoke, One who comes after me is before me,
because he was prior to me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.30

And of his Fulness we have all received, even Grace for Grace.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.31

Since the Law was given by Moses, Grace and Truth was by Jesus Christ.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.32

None has ever seen God; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.33

that only begotten Son, who is in the Bosom of the Father, has declared
<font> him <$$font>.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,1J.34

And this was the Testimony of John, when the Jews sent Priests and
Levites out of Jerusalem, for them to ask him, Who art thou?  <P_1,20J>
Whereupon he confessed, and did not deny, even confessed, I am not Christ.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.35

And they asked him, What then?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.36

Art thou Elias?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.37

To which he says, I am not.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.38

Art thou the Prophet?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.39

And he answered, No.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.40

Therefore they enquired of him, Who art thou?  that we may give an Answer
to them that sent us: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.41

what dost speak concerning thy self?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.42

He replied: I am the Voice of one crying out in the Wilderness,
Let the Way for the Lord be straight; as the Prophet Esaias said.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.43

Moreover those who were sent were some of the Pharisees.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.44

Next they asked him in this manner, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou
art not Christ, nor Elias, nor the Prophet?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.45

John made answer to them; I baptize with Water; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.46

but there stands one amongst you, whom ye do not know.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.47

It is he that comes after me, who is before me; the Latchet of whose
Shoe I am not worthy that I should undo.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.48

These Things were done at Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
baptizing.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.49

The next Day John beholds Jesus coming to him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.50

and says; Lo the Lamb of God, that takes away the Sin of the World.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.51

This is he concerning whom I said, There comes a Man after me, who is
before me, because he was prior to me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.52

And I did not know him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.53

but for this reason that he should be made manifest to Israel, I came
baptizing with Water.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.54

Besides John testified thus; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.55

I beheld the Spirit come down as a Dove out of Heaven,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.56

and it remained on him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.57

And I did not know him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.58

but the same that sent me to baptize with Water, said to me, He, on
whom thou shalt see the Spirit come down, and remain on him, it is that
baptizes with the Holy Spirit.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.59

So I saw, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.60

and testified that this was the Son of God.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.61

The next Day again John was standing, and two of his Disciples;
When he looked at Jesus walking and says, Lo the Lamb of God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.62

And the two Disciples heard him speak, whereupon they followed Jesus.
Who turning, when he saw them follow him, asks them, What do ye seek ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.63

And they said to him, Rabbi <paren> which is to say being interpreted
Master <$$paren> where dost thou remain?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.64

He replies to them, Come, and see PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.65

they came, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.66

and saw where it was, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.67

and remained with him that Day; it being about the tenth Hour.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,20J.68

<P_1,40J>

One of the two that heard <font> it <$$font> from John, and followed him ,
was Andrew, the Brother of Simon Peter.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.70

He first finds out his Brother Simon, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.71

and says to him, We have found the Messias; which is being interpreted
Christ.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.72

Nay he brought him to Jesus; who looking on him, said, Thou art Simon
the Son of Jonas, thou shalt be called Cephas; which is being interpreted
a Rock.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.73

The next Day Jesus was minded to go out into Galilee; when he finds
Philip, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.74

and says to him, Follow me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.75

Now Philip was from Bethsaida, out of the City of Andrew and Peter.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.76

Philip finds out Nathanael, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.77

and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the Law, as
also the Prophets wrote, Jesus the Son of Joseph, from Nazareth.
To whom Nathanael said, Can there be any good Thing from Nazareth?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.78

Philip replies to him, Come, and see.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.79

When Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, he says of him, Lo an Israelite
truly, in whom there is not Deceit.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.80

Nathanael asks him, Whence dost thou know me?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.81

Jesus made answer to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast
under the Fig-tree, I saw thee.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.82

Nathanael returns him answer, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.83

thou art the King of Israel!  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.84

Jesus made reply to him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.85

Because I said to thee, I saw thee underneath the Fig tree, dost thou
believe?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.86

Thou shall see greater Things than these.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.87

I say to thee very certainly, added he to him, Henceforth you shall see
Heaven opened, and the Angels of God go up and come down on the Man.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,1,40J.88

<P_2,1J>

Chap. II.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.91

<$$heading>

And the third Day there was a Marriage at Cana of Galilee,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.93

and the Mother of Jesus was there.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.94

Besides both Jesus was invited, and his Disciples to the Marriage.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.95

At length there being a want of Wine, the Mother of Jesus says to him,
They have no Wine.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.96

Jesus answers her, What hast thou to do with me, Woman?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.97

My Hour is not yet come.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.98

His Mother says to the Waiters, Do whatever he bids you.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.99

Now six Water-pots of Stone being there, put according to the Cleansing
of the Jews, which held two or three Firkins apiece; Jesus says to them,
Fill the Water-pots with Water: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.100

so they filled them quite up.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.101

Next he orders them, Draw now, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.102

and carry to the Master of the Feast; which they did.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.103

And when that Master had tasted the Water become Wine <paren> and did
not know whence it was, though the Waiters who drawed the Water knew
<$$paren> he calls the Bridegroom, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.104

And says to him, Every Man first puts good Wine, and when People have
drunk plentifully, then smaller; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.105

thou hast kept the good Wine till now.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.106

This Beginning of Miracles Jesus did at Cana of Galilee,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.107

and made his Glory manifest; so that his disciples believed on him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.108

After this he went down to Capernaum with his Mother, Brethren and
Disciples; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.109

but did not remain there many Days.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.110

The Passover of the Jews also was near, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.111

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.112

And he found in the Temple them who sold Oxen, Sheep and Doves, and
those that changed Coin sitting.  Upon which he made a Scourge a Cords ,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.113

and put them all out of the Temple, with the Sheep and Oxen; as likewise
poured out the Coin of the Money-changers and overturned the Tables.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.114

Moreover he said to them that sold Doves, Take away these things hence ;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.115

do not make my Father's House a House of Merchandice.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.116

And his Disciples remembred that it was written, The Zeal of thy House
has eat me up.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.117

Therefore the Jews made answer to him, What Sign shewest thou to
us, since thou doest these Things? .  To whom Jesus made reply,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.118

Demolish this Temple, and in three Days I will raise it up.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,1J.119

<P_2,20J>

The Jews therefore said, Forty six Years this Temple has been building,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.121

and wilt thou raise it up in three Days?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.122

Whereas he spoke concerning the Temple of his Body.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.123

Therefore when he was risen up from the Dead, his Disciples remembered
that he had spoken this to them PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.124

so they believed the Scripture, and the Word which Jesus said.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.125

Now as he was in Jerusalem at the Passover on the Feast, many
believed on his Name, at seeing his Miracles which he did.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.126

Yet Jesus did not trust himself to them; because he knew all,
And since he had no Need that any should testify concerning Man:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.127

for he knew what was in Man.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,2,20J.128

<P_3,1J>

<heading>

Chap. III.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.131

<$$heading>

There being also a Man of the Pharisees, whose Name was Nicodemus,
a Ruler of the Jews; He came to Jesus by Night, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.133

and said to him, Rabbi, we are sensible that thou art a Teacher come
from God: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.134

for none can do these Miracles which thou doest, except God is with him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.135

Jesus made answer to him; I tell thee very certainly, Except any one
is born from above, he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} see the Kingdom of God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.136

Nicodemus replies to him, How can a Man be born when he is old?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.137

Can he enter the second time into his Mother's Womb, and be born?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.138

Jesus answered: I tell thee very certainly; Except any one is born of
Water and the Spirit, he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} enter into the Kingdom
of God.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.139

What is born of the Flesh, is Flesh; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.140

and what is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.141

Do not wonder that I said to thee, You must be born from above.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.142

The Spirit breathes where it will, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.143

and thou hearest the Voice of it, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.144

but dost not know whence it comes, and whither it goes
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.145

so is it with every one who is born of the Spirit.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.146

Nicodemus made answer to him, How can these Things be?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.147

Jesus made reply to him: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.148

Art thou a Teacher of Israel, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.149

and dost not know these Things?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.150

I tell thee very certainly, that we speak what we know, and testify what
we have seen; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.151

yet ye do not receive our Testimony.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.152

If I have told you earthly Things and ye do not believe, how will ye
believe, if I should tell you heavenly Things?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.153

And none has gone up into Heaven, excepting he that came down out of it,
the Man who was in Heaven.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.154

As Moses too put up the Serpent in the Wilderness, so must the Man be
put up; That every one who believes in him may not perish, but have
everlasting Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.155

For God thus loved the World, so that he gave his only begotten Son, that
every one who believes in him may not perish, but have everlasting Life.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.156

For God did not send his Son into the World, that he might condemn the
World, but that it might be saved by him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.157

He who believes in him, is not condemned; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.158

but he that does not believe, is condemned already, because he
did not believe in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.159

Now this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and
Men loved Darkness rather than Light: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.160

for their Works were wicked.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,1J.161

<P_3,20J>

For every one who commits what is bad, hates the Light,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.163

and does not come to it, that his Works may not be reproved.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.164

Whereas he who does according to the Truth, comes to the Light, that
his Works may be made manifest, because they are wrought through God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.165

After these Things came Jesus, and his Disciples into the
Country of Judea; where he abode with them, and baptized.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.166

And John also was baptizing at Enon near Salim, because much Water was
there; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.167

so People came, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.168

and were baptized.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.169

For John was not yet cast into Prison.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.170

There was therefore a Question from the disciples of John with the Jews,
about Cleansing.  Whereupon they came to John, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.171

and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou
didst testify, behold does baptize, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.172

and all come to him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.173

John made answer: A Man can receive Nothing, except it be given him
from Heaven.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.174

You your selves testify for me, that I said, I am not Christ, but that
I am sent before him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.175

He who has the Bride is the Bride groom; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.176

but the Friend of the Bridegroom, that stands and hears him, rejoices
with Joy for the Bridegroom's Voice: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.177

this Joy of mine therefore is fulfilled.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.178

He must increase, but I decrease.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.179

He who comes from above, is above all: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.180

he that was of the Earth, is of the Earth, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.181

and speaks of it: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.182

he who comes from Heaven, is above all.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.183

And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; though none receives
his Testimony.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.184

He who has received his Testimony, has sealed that God is true.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.185

For he whom God has sent, speaks the Words of God; since God does not give
<font> him <$$font> the Spirit by Measure.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.186

The Father loves the Son, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.187

and has given all Things into his Power.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.188

He that believes in the Son, has everlasting Life;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.189

and he that is disobedient to the Son, will not see Life,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.190

but the Wrath of God remains on him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,3,20J.191

<P_4,1J>

<heading>

Chap. IV.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.194

<$$heading>

When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pharisees had heard, that Jesus
made and baptized more Disciples than John; <paren> However indeed Jesus
himself did not baptize, but his Disciples <$$paren> He left Judea,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.196

and went away again into Galilee.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.197

And he must go through Samaria.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.198

Therefore he comes to a City of Samaria called Sichar, nigh a Field
which Jacob gave to his Son Joseph.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.199

And Jacob's Well was there; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.200

Jesus therefore being fatigued by the Journey, sate
{COM:sic_here_and_passim} down accordingly on the Well: it being about
the sixth Hour.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.201

A Woman of Samaria coming to draw Water, Jesus says to her, Give me <font>
some <$$font> to drink.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.202

For his Disciples were gone away into the City, that they might buy Food.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.203

The Woman of Samaria therefore says to him, How dost thou
who art a Jew ask of me to drink, that am a Woman of Samaria?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.204

For the Jews do not deal with the Samaritans.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.205

Jesus made answer to her, If thou hadst known the Gift of God, and who
it is that says to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of
him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.206

and he would have given thee living Water.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.207

The Woman says to him; Master, thou hast Nothing to draw with,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.208

and the Well is deep; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.209

whence therefore hast thou living Water?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.210

Art thou greater than our Father Jacob, who drank of it himself, his
Children and Cattle?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.211

Jesus made answer to her; Everyone that drinks of this Water, will be
thirsty again: Whereas whoever drinks of the Water which I shall give him,
will not be thirsty at all for ever; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.212

but the Water which I shall give him, will become in him a Well of Water
bubbling up to everlasting Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.213

The Woman requests of him, Master, give me this Water; that I may not
be thirsty, nor come hither to draw.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.214

Jesus says to her, Go, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.215

call thy Husband, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.216

and come hither.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.217

The Woman made reply, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.218

I have no Husband.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.219

Jesus tells her; Thou hast said well, I have no Husband.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.220

For thou hast had five Husbands; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.221

and he whom thou hast now is not thy Husband: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.222

this thou saidest truly.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.223

The Woman rejoins to him; Master, I see that thou art a Prophet.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,1J.224

<P_4,20J>

Our Fathers worshipped on this Mountain; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.226

and you say that in Jerusalem is the Place where one must worship.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.227

To her Jesus says; Woman, believe me, that the Hour is coming, when
neither on this Mountain, nor in Jerusalem, you will worship the Father.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.228

You know not what you worship, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.229

we know what we worship; because Salvation is of the Jews.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.230

But the Hour is coming, and is now, when the true Worshippers
shall worship the Father with the Spirit and the Truth:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.231

for the Father also seeks much to worship him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.232

God is a Spirit; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.233

and those who worship him, must worship him with the Spirit and the Truth.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.234

The Woman says to him, I know that the Messias is coming, who is called
Christ; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.235

when he is come, he will tell us all Things.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.236

Jesus declares to her, I am <font> he <$$font>, who speak to thee
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.237

And upon this his Disciples came, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.238

and wondered that he talked with the Woman; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.239

nevertheless none said, What dost thou seek?  or, Why talkest thou
with her?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.240

The Woman therefore left her Water pot, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.241

and went into the City, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.242

and says to the Men, Come, see a Man who told me all Things whatever I
did; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.243

is not this Christ?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.244

Therefore they went out of the City PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.245

and came to him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.246

Now in the mean while his Disciples thus intreated him, Rabbi, do eat.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.247

But he said to them, I have Meat to eat which ye do not know of.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.248

His Disciples therefore said one to another, Has any one brought for
him to eat?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.249

Jesus replies to them; My Meat is, that I may do the Will of him who
sent me and finish his Work.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.250

Do not ye say, that there are yet four Months, and then Harvest comes?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.251

Behold I tell you, Look up, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.252

and see that the Grounds are white already towards Harvest.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.253

And he who reaps, does receive Wages, and gather together Fruit for
everlasting Life; that both he who sows, and he who reaps, may rejoice
together.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.254

For in this the Saying is true, that there is one who sows, and another
who reaps.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.255

I have sent you to reap what you did not labour in:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.256

others laboured, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.257

and you are entered into their Labour.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.258

And many of the Samaritans of that City believed in him, for the Saying
of the Woman, who testified, He told me all Things whatever I did.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,20J.259

<P_4,40J>

When the Samaritans therefore were come to him, they intreated him to
remain with them; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.261

and he remained there two Days.  Whereby many more believed for his
own Saying.  So that they said to the Woman, We believe no more for thy
speaking; since we have heard our selves, and know that this is truly
Christ, the Saviour of the World.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.262

But after two Days Jesus came out thence, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.263

and went away into <font> Part of <$$font> Galilee.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.264

For he himself testified, that a Prophet has not Honour in his own
Country.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.265

Therefore when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him,
having seen all the Things which he did in Jerusalem at the Feast:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.266

for they also came to the Feast.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.267

Jesus therefore came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made Water
Wine; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.268

and there was some Nobleman, whose Son was sick at Capernaum.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.269

He hearing that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, came away to
him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.270

and intreated him, that he would go down, and heal his Son:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.271

for he was about to die.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.272

Therefore Jesus said to him, Except you see Signs and Wonders, you will
not at all believe.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.273

The Nobleman says to him, Lord, come down, before my Boy dies.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.274

Jesus replies to him, Go; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.275

thy Son will live.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.276

So the Man believed the Saying which Jesus spoke to him,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.277

and went.  Whereupon as he was now going down, his Servants met him,
and declared thus, Thy Boy will live.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.278

He therefore asked of them the Hour in which he got to be better;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.279

and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh Hour the Fever left him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.280

The Father therefore knew that it was in the same Hour, in which Jesus
said to him, Thy Son will live; so that he himself believed, and his
whole Houshold {COM:sic}.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.281

This again was the second Miracle Jesus did, after he came out of Judea
into Galilee.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,4,40J.282

<P_5,1J>

<heading>

Chap. V.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.285

<$$heading>

After these Things there was a Feast of the Jews,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.287

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.288

And there is in Jerusalem at the Sheep <font> gate <$$font> a
Pool , which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, that has five Porches.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.289

In these lay a great Multitude of ailing Persons, blind, lame, withered ,
waiting for the moving of the Water.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.290

For an Angel came down into the Pool according to the Time,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.291

and disturbed the Water; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.292

he therefore who first went in after the disturbing of it,
became well, whensoever he had been seized with a Distemper.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.293

Now some Man was there, who had been in an Ailment thirty eight Years.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.294

Jesus seeing him lie, as he knew that it had been now a great while,
says to him, Wilt thou become well?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.295

He who was ailing answered him, Lord, I have no Man, that when the Water
is disturbed, may put me into the Pool; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.296

but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.297

Jesus says to him, Arise, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.298

take up thy Bed, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.299

and go.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.300

And presently the Man became well, so that he took up his Bed, and went;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.301

and the Sabbath was on that Day.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.302

Therefore the Jews said to him who was cured, This is the Sabbath;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.303

it is not lawful for thee to take up the Bed.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.304

He answered them; The same who made me well, said to me, Take up thy Bed,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.305

and go.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.306

They therefore asked him; What Man is it who spoke these Words
to thee?  Whereas he that was healed did not know who it was:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.307

for Jesus was withdrawn, while a Company was in the Place.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.308

After these Things Jesus finds him in the Temple,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.309

and said to him, Lo thou art become well; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.310

sin no more, that Something worse may not come to thee.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.311

The Man went away, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.312

and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him well.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.313

And for this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.314

and endeavoured to kill him, because he had done these Things on the
Sabbath.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.315

But Jesus answered them, My Father works hitherto,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.316

and I work.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.317

For this reason therefore the Jews endeavoured the more to kill him,
because he not only disannulled the Sabbath, but also said God was his
Father, making himself equal to God.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.318

Therefore Jesus made answer to them: I say to you very certainly; The
Son $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do any Thing of himself, excepting what he
sees the Father do: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.319

for what Things soever he does, these also the Son does in like Manner.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,1J.320

<P_5,20J>

For the Father loves the Son, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.322

and shews him all Things which himself does; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.323

nay he will shew him greater Things than these, that you may wonder.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.324

For according as the Father raises up the Dead, and makes alive; so the
Son also makes alive them that he will.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.325

For the Father does not judge any, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.326

but has given all Judgment to the Son; That all might honour the Son,
as they do the Father.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.327

He that honours not the Son, does not honour the Father who sent him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.328

I tell you very certainly, that he who hears my Word, and believes in
him who sent me, has everlasting Life; and does not come into Judgment,
but is departed out of Death into Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.329

I say to you very certainly, that the Hour is coming, and now is, when
the Dead will hear the Voice of the Son of God; and those who hear,
will live.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.330

For according as the Father has Life in himself, so has he given to the
Son to have Life in himself; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.331

Nay has given him Authority even to execute Judgment, because he is
the Man.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.332

Do not wonder at this: since the Hour is coming, in which all who are
in the Graves will hear his Voice; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.333

And those who do good Things will come out to the Resurrection of
Life , but they that commit bad ones to the Resurrection of Damnation.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.334

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do any Thing of my self:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.335

as I hear, I judge, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.336

and my Judgment is righteous; because I seek not my own Will, but the
Will of the Father who sent me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.337

If I <font> only <$$font> testify concerning my self, my Testimony is
not a true one.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.338

There is another who testifies concerning me, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.339

and I know that the Testimony which he testifies concerning me is true.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.340

You sent to John, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.341

and he testified to the Truth.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.342

However I do not receive Testimony from Man; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.343

but say these Things, that you may be saved.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.344

He was a burning and shining Lamp; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.345

and you were willing for a little while to be joyful in his Light.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.346

Yet I have greater Testimony than John's: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.347

for the Works which the Father has given me, that I might finish them,
these Works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father sent me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.348

The Father also who sent me, has himself testified concerning me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.349

You have neither ever heard his Voice, nor seen his Appearance.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.350

Moreover you have not his Word remaining in you; because the same whom
he has sent, him you do not believe.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.351

You search the Scriptures, because you think to find everlasting Life
in them; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.352

and those are they that testify concerning me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,20J.353

<P_5,40J>

Nevertheless you will not come to me, that you may have Life.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.355

I do not receive Glory from Men.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.356

But I know that you have not the Love of God in your selves.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.357

I am come in the Name of my Father, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.358

and you do not receive me: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.359

if another should come in his own Name, you would receive him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.360

How can you believe, who receive Glory one from another, and do not seek
the Glory which is from God alone?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.361

Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.362

it is Moses who accuses you, in whom you hope.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.363

For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.364

for he wrote concerning me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.365

But if you do not believe his Writings, how should you believe my Sayings?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,5,40J.366

<P_6,1J>

<heading>

Chap. VI.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.369

<$$heading>

After these Things Jesus went away beyond the Sea of Galilee, that
of Tiberias.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.371

And a great Company followed him, because they saw his Miracles which
he did on those who were ailing.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.372

So Jesus went up on a Mountain, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.373

and sate there with his Disciples.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.374

Moreover the Passover, a Feast of the Jews, was near.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.375

Jesus therefore looked up, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.376

and seeing a great Company come to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we
buy Bread, that these may eat?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.377

<paren> But he said this to try him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.378

for he himself knew what he was about to do <$$paren>
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.379

Philip answered him, Two hundred Penny-worth of Bread is not
sufficient for them, that each of them may take some Little.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.380

One of his Disciples, Andrew the Brother of Simon Peter, says to him,
There is a Boy here who has five Barley-loaves, and two little Fishes;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.381

but what are these for so many?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.382

However Jesus said, Make the Persons sit down; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.383

and there was much Grass in the Place: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.384

the Men accordingly sate down, in Number about five thousand.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.385

When Jesus took the Loaves, and giving thanks, gave to the Disciples,
and they to those who were sate down; and in like Manner of the little
Fishes, as much as they would have.  And when they were filled, he says
to his Disciples, Gather together the Fragments which are over and above,
that there may not any Thing be lost.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.386

Therefore they gathered together, and filled twelve Baskets with the
Fragments of the five Barley-loaves, which were over and above to them
that eat.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.387

The Men therefore seeing the Miracle which Jesus did, said, This is truly
the Prophet who was to come into the World.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.388

Jesus therefore knowing that they were about to come, and take him
by force, that they might make him King, departed again to a Mountain
himself alone.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.389

And when it was Evening, his Disciples went down to the Sea.  Where they
got aboard a Ship, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.390

and were going beyond the Sea to Capernaum; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.391

and it was now dark, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.392

besides Jesus was not come to them.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.393

And the Sea rose up, by a great Wind blowing.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.394

Therefore having driven on about twenty five or thirty Furlongs, they
see Jesus walking on the Sea, and being near the Ship; at which they
were afraid.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,1J.395

<P_6,20J>

But he says to them, It is I, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.397

do not fear; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.398

They were desirous therefore to receive him into the Ship;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.399

and this it self was presently at the Land to which they were going.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.400

The next Day the Company who stood on the farther Side of the Sea, seeing
that no other Boat was there, but that one into which his Disciples
were gone, and that Jesus was not entered with his Disciples into the
Boat , but they went away alone; But yet other Boats came from Tiberias,
near the Place where they had eat Bread, the Lord having given thanks:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.401

When the Company therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor his
Disciples; they also went into a Ship, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.402

and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.403

And finding him beyond the Sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when didst thou
come hither?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.404

Jesus made answer to them; I tell you very certainly, You seek for me,
not because you saw the Miracles, but because you did eat of the Loaves,
and were filled.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.405

Do not work for the Meat that perishes, but for the Meat that remains to
everlasting Life, which the Man will give you: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.406

for God the Father has sealed him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.407

They therefore said to him, What shall we do, that we may work the Work
of God?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.408

Jesus made reply to them, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.409

This is the Work of God, that you should believe in him whom he has sent.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.410

Therefore they said to him; What Miracle doest thou, that we may see,
and believe thee?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.411

What dost thou work?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.412

Our Forefathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.413

as it is written, He gave them Bread to eat from Heaven.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.414

Jesus therefore said to them; I tell you very certainly, Moses did not
give you the Bread from Heaven; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.415

but my Father gives you the true Bread from Heaven.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.416

For the Bread of God is that which comes down from Heaven, and gives
Life to the World.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.417

They therefore said to him, Lord, always give us this Bread.  Upon which
Jesus replied to them: I am the Bread of Life; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.418

he that comes to me shall not be hungry at all,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.419

and he who believes in me shall never be thirsty at all.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.420

But I have said to you, that you have even seen me, and do not believe.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.421

All whom the Father gives me shall come to me, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.422

and him that comes to me I will not at all cast forth abroad: Because
I am come down from Heaven, not that I should do my own Will, but the
Will of him who sent me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.423

And this is the Will of the Father who sent me, that all whom he has
given me I should lose none of it, but raise it up at the last Day.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,20J.424

<P_6,40J>

This is likewise the Will of him who sent me, that every one who sees
the Son, and believes in him, shall have everlasting Life and I will
raise him up at the last Day.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.426

The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he said, I am the Bread that
came down from Heaven.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.427

And they said, Is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph, whose Father and
Mother we know?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.428

How then does he say, I am come down from Heaven?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.429

Therefore Jesus made answer to them: Do not murmur with one another.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.430

None can come to me, except the Father who sent me draws him;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.431

and I will raise him up at the last Day.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.432

It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught by God:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.433

every one therefore who has heard from the Father, and learned, shall
come to me.  Not that any has seen the Father, excepting he who is from
God; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.434

this has seen the Father.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.435

I say to you very certainly; He who believes in me has everlasting Life.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.436

I am the Bread of Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.437

Your Forefathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.438

yet are dead.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.439

This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven, that any one may eat of
it, and not die.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.440

I am the living Bread, which came down from Heaven:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.441

if any one eats of this Bread, he will live for ever;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.442

and the Bread too that I will give, is my Flesh, which I will give for
the Life of the World.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.443

The Jews therefore contended one with another, saying, How can he give
us the Flesh to eat?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.444

Therefore Jesus said to them: I tell you very certainly; Except you
eat the Flesh of the Man, and drink his Blood, you have not Life in
your selves.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.445

He that eats my Flesh, and drinks my Blood, has everlasting Life;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.446

and I will raise him up at the last Day.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.447

For my Flesh truly is Meat, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.448

and my Blood truly is Drink.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.449

He that eats my Flesh, and drinks my Blood, remains in me, and I in him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.450

As the Living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father; even the
same who eats me, shall also live by me, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.451

This <font> that <$$font> is the Bread which came down from Heaven; not as
your Forefathers did eat Manna, yet are dead: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.452

he that eats this Bread will live for ever.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.453

These Things he said in the Synagogue, while he taught at Capernaum.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,40J.454

<P_6,60J>

When many of his Disciples therefore heard, they said, This is a hard
Matter, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.456

who can hear it?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.457

Now Jesus knowing in himself that his Disciples murmured about it,
said to them; Does this offend you?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.458

<font> How <$$font> if therefore you should see the Man go up where he
was before?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.459

It is the Spirit that makes alive, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.460

the Flesh does not profit any Thing: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.461

<font> of <$$font> the Words which I speak to you, it is the Spirit,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.462

and it is the Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.463

But there are some of you that do not believe.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.464

For Jesus knew from the Beginning who they were that did not believe,
and who it was that would deliver him up.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.465

He further added, For this reason I said to you, that none can come to
me, except it is given to him from my Father.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.466

Thenceforth many of his Disciples went away back,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.467

and walked no more with him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.468

Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Are you also minded to go?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.469

Therefore Simon Peter answered him; Lord, to whom should we go away?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.470

Thou hast the Words of everlasting Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.471

And we believe and know, that thou art Christ the Son of the Living God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.472

Jesus replied to them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
is a Devil?  Which he spoke of Judas Isariot <font> the Son <$$font>
of Simon: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.473

for he would deliver him up, who was one of the twelve.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,6,60J.474

Chap. VII.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.477

<$$heading>

And Jesus after these Things walked in Galilee: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.479

for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews endeavoured to kill him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.480

Moreover the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was near.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.481

His Brethren therefore said to him; Depart hence,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.482

and go into Judea; that thy Disciples may also see thy Works which
thou doest.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.483

For none does any Thing in Secret, when he himself seeks to be in Publick:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.484

if thou doest these Things, make thy self manifest to the World.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.485

For his Brethren did not believe in him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.486

Jesus therefore says to them; My Time is not yet come; whereas yours is
always ready.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.487

The World $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hate you; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.488

but me it hates, because I testify concerning it, that its Deeds are
wicked.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.489

Get you up to this Feast: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.490

I go not up to it yet, because my Time is not yet fulfilled.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.491

So having said these Things to them, he remained in Galilee.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.492

However when his Brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the Feast,
not openly, but as it were in Secret; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.493

Therefore the Jews sought for him at the Feast, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.494

and said, Where is he?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.495

And there was much Murmuring about him among the Multitude:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.496

some indeed said; He is good; whereas others said, No, but he seduces
the Company.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.497

Nevertheless none spoke in Publick concerning him, through Fear of
the Jews.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.498

Now at length it being the middle of the Feast, Jesus went up to the
Temple, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.499

and taught.  Whereupon the Jews wondered, saying, How does he know the
Scriptures, when he has not learned?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.500

Jesus made answer to them; My Doctrine is not my Own, but his who sent me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.501

If any one likes to do his Will, he shall know concerning the Doctrine,
whether it is from God, or I speak of my self.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.502

He that speaks of himself, seeks his own Glory; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.503

but the same that seeks his Glory who sent him, is true,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.504

and there is not Unrighteousness in him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.505

Did not Moses give you the Law, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.506

and none of you performs it?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.507

Why do you seek to kill me?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,1J.508

<P_7,20J>

The Company made answer, Thou hast the Devil, who seeks to kill thee.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.510

Jesus made reply to them; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.511

I have done one Work, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.512

and you all wonder.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.513

For this reason Moses gave you Circumcision <paren> not that it is from
Moses, but from the Fathers <$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.514

and on the Sabbath you circumcise a Male.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.515

If a Male on the Sabbath receive Circumcision, that the Law of Moses may
not be disannulled; are you enraged at me, because I have made a Person
all over well on the Sabbath?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.516

Do not judge according to the Sight, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.517

but judge righteous Judgment.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.518

Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said; Is not this he whom they seek
to kill?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.519

Whereas lo he speaks in Publick, and they say Nothing to him;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.520

have the Rulers known of a truth at any time, that this truly is Christ?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.521

Yet we know whence this is; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.522

but when Christ comes, none knows whence he is.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.523

Therefore Jesus cried out in the Temple, teaching, and saying; You both
know me, and know whence I am; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.524

yet I am not come of my self, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.525

but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.526

I notwithstanding know him; because I am from him, and he has sent me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.527

They sought therefore to apprehend him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.528

however none put Hand on him, because his Hour was not yet come.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.529

Nay many of the Company believed in him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.530

and said, When Christ comes, will he do more Miracles than these which
this has done?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.531

The Pharisees heard of the Company murmuring these Things concerning him;
whereupon they, and the chief Priests, sent Officers to apprehend him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.532

Jesus therefore said to them; Yet a little while I am with you,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.533

then I go to him who sent me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.534

You will seek me, and not find; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.535

and where I am, you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.536

Therefore the Jews said to themselves; Whither is he about to go, that
we may not find him?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.537

Is he about to go to the disapersed ones of the Greeks, and teach
the Greeks?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.538

What Saying is this which he said, You will seek me, and not find;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.539

and where I am, you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.540

On the last Day too, the great one of the Feast, Jesus stood,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.541

and cried out as follows; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.542

If any one is thirsty, let him come to me, and drink.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.543

He that believes in me, as the Scripture said, Rivers of living Water
will slow out of his Inside.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.544

<paren> But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they should receive
who believed in him: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.545

for there was not the Holy Spirit yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified
<$$paren>.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,20J.546

<P_7,40J>

Many of the Company therefore hearing the Words, said, This truly is
the Prophet.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.548

Others said, This is Christ.  But others again; Will Christ forsooth
come out of Galilee?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.549

Did not the Scripture say, that Christ comes out of David's Offspring,
and from Bethlehem the Town, where David was?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.550

There became therefore a Division in the Company by reason of him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.551

And some of them would have apprehended him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.552

but none put Hands on him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.553

So the Officers came to the chief Priests and Pharisees; who said to
them , For what reason did not you bring him?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.554

The Officers answered, Never did a Man speak so as this Man.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.555

The Pharisees therefore replied to them; Are you also seduced?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.556

Have any of the Rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.557

But this Company, who are ignorant of the Law, are cursed.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.558

Nicodemus says to them, he who came to Jesus by Night, being one of them,
Does our Law judge a Man, except it has first heard from him, and knows
what he does?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.559

They made answer to him, Art thou also from Galilee?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.560

Find, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.561

and see, that no Prophet rises up from Galilee.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.562

Thus each went to his House. : PURVER-NEW-1764-1,7,40J.563

<P_8,1J>

Chap. VIII.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.566

<$$heading>

Besides Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.568

And when it was Break of Day he came into the Temple,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.569

and all the People came to him; at which he sate down, and taught them.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.570

The Scribes and Pharisees also brought to him a Woman taken in Adultery
; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.571

and setting her in the midst, They say to him; Master, this
Woman was taken in the Crime it self of committing Adultery.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.572

Now in the Law Moses commanded us, that such a one should be stoned;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.573

what dost thou therefore say?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.574

Whereas they said this, by trying him, that they might have <font>
Something <$$font> to accuse him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.575

but Jesus stooped down, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.576

and wrote with his Finger on the Ground.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.577

However as they continued asking him, he stood upright,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.578

and said to them, Let him of you that is without Sin first throw a Stone
at her.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.579

And again he stooped down, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.580

and wrote on the Ground.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.581

This they hearing, and checked by Conscience, went out one by
one, proceeding first from the eldest to the last; so that Jesus
was left alone, and the Woman standing in the middle Place.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.582

At length Jesus stood upright, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.583

and when he saw Nobody besides the Woman, he said to her, Woman, where
are those Accusers of thine?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.584

Has none condemned thee?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.585

And she said, None, Lord.  Upon which Jesus replied to her, Neither do
I condemn thee; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.586

go, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.587

and sin no more.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.588

Jesus therefore spoke again to them as follows, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.589

I am the Light of the World: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.590

he that follows me, shall not at all walk in Darkness, but have the
Light of Life.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.591

Therefore the Pharisees said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thy self;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.592

thy Testimony is not a true one.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.593

Jesus made answer to them; Though I do testify concerning my self, my
Testimony is a true one; since I know whence I came, and whither I am
going: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.594

but you know neither whence I come, or whether I am going.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.595

You judge according to the Flesh, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.596

I do not judge any one.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.597

And yet if I judge, my Judgment is true; because I am not alone,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.598

but as well as I there is the Father who sent me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.599

Nay it is written also in your Law, that the Testimony of two Men is a
true one.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.600

I am one that testifies concerning my self, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.601

however the Father who sent me testifies concerning me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.602

They therefore said to him, Where is thy Father?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.603

Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.604

if you knew me, you would also have known my Father.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,1J.605

<P_8,20J>

These Things spoke Jesus in the Treasury, when he taught in the Temple;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.607

and none apprehended him, because his Hour was not yet come.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.608

Therefore Jesus said again to them, I am going,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.609

and though you may seek me, yet will die in your Sins;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.610

<font> then <$$font> whither I am going, you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.611

The Jews therefore said; Will he kill himself, because he says, Whither
I am going, you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.612

And he answered them; You are from below, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.613

I am from above: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.614

you are of this World, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.615

I am not of this World.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.616

I therefore said to you, that you will die in your Sins:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.617

for if you do not believe that I am <font> so <$$font> you will die in
your Sins.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.618

Therefore they asked him, Who art thou?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.619

And Jesus replied to them; Even he whom I told you at the Beginning.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.620

I have many Things concerning you to say, and judge;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.621

but he who sent me is true, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.622

and those Things which I have heard from him I speak in the World.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.623

They did not know that he spoke to them <font> of <$$font> the Father.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.624

Jesus therefore said to them; When you have lifted up the Man, then will
you know that I am <font> so <$$font> and that I do Nothing of my self;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.625

but as my Father has taught me, I speak these Things.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.626

And he who sent me is with me: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.627

the Father has not left me alone, since I always do the Things that
please him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.628

He speaking these Things, many believed in him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.629

Therefore Jesus said to the Jews who did; If you remain in my Word,
you truly are my Disciples.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.630

Moreover you will know the Truth PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.631

and that will make you free.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.632

They answered him; We are the Offspring of Abraham,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.633

and have never been in Servitude to any; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.634

how dost thou say, You will become free?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.635

Jesus answered them; I say to you very certainly, that every one who
does Sin is a Servant of Sin.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.636

Now a Servant does not remain in the House for ever,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.637

the Son remains for ever.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.638

If therefore the Son Shall make you free, you will really be free.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.639

I know that you are the Offspring of Abraham; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.640

but you seek to kill me, because my word does not come into you.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.641

speak what I have seen with my father; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.642

and you therefore do what you have seen with yours.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.643

They made answer to him, Abraham is our Father.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.644

Jesus replies to them; If you were Abraham's Children, you would indeed
do the Deeds of Abraham.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,20J.645

<P_8,40J>

But now you seek to kill me, a Man who has spoken the Truth to you,
which I heard from God: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.647

this Abraham did not do.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.648

You do the Deeds of your Father.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.649

Therefore they said to him, We are not born of Whoredom:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.650

we have one Father, <font> namely <$$font> God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.651

Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would love me:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.652

for I came forth, and am come, from God; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.653

nor indeed did I come of my self, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.654

but he sent me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.655

For what reason do ye not know my Speaking?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.656

Because you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hear my Word.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.657

You are from your Father the Devil, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.658

and the Desires of your Father you like to do.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.659

He was a Murderer from the Beginning, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.660

and did not stand in the Truth, because the Truth is not in him;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.661

when he speaks a Lye, he speaks of his own; because he is a Liar, and
the Father of it.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.662

And because I tell the Truth, you do not believe me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.663

Which of you convinces me of Sin?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.664

And if I tell the Truth, for what reason do ye not believe me?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.665

He that is from God, hears God's Sayings: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.666

for this reason ye do not hear, because ye are not from God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.667

Therefore the Jews made answer to him, Do not we say well, that thou
art a Samaritan, and hast a Devil?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.668

Jesus answered; I have not a Devil; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.669

but I honour my Father, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.670

and you dishonour me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.671

Nay I do not seek my own Glory: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.672

there is one who seeks, and judges.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.673

I say to you very certainly, If any one observes my Word, he will not
at all see Death for ever.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.674

The Jews therefore replied to him; Now we know that thou hast a Devil:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.675

Abraham is dead, and the Prophets, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.676

yet thou <font> sayest <$$font>, If any one observes my Word, he will
not at all taste Death for ever.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.677

Art thou greater than our Father Abraham, who is dead?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.678

And the Prophets are dead: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.679

whom dost thou make thy self?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.680

Jesus answered; If I glorify my self, my Glory is Nothing:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.681

it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.682

Nevertheless you have not known him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.683

but I know him: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.684

and if I say that I do not know him, I should be a Liar like you;
whereas I know him, and observe his Word.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.685

Your Father Abraham was joyful that he should see my Day; which he saw,
and rejoiced.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.686

Therefore the Jews said to him, Thou art not yet fifty Years old,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.687

and hast thou beheld Abraham?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.688

Jesus said to them; I tell you very certainly, Before Abraham was I am.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.689

They therefore took up Stones, that they might throw at him;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.690

but Jesus hid, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.691

and went out of the Temple, going through the midst of them,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.692

and passed away so.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,8,40J.693

<P_9,1J>

<heading>

Chap. IX.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.696

<$$heading>

Moreover passing away, he saw a Man blind from the Birth.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.698

And his Disciples asked him as follows, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.699

Rabbi, who sinned, he or his Parents, that he was born blind?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.700

Jesus answered; Neither did he sin, nor his Parents;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.701

but <font> it <$$font> was that the Works of God might be made manifest
in him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.702

I must work the Works of him who sent me, while it is Day:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.703

the Night comes, when none can work.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.704

As long as I am in the World, I am the Light of the World.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.705

Having said these Things, he spit on the Ground,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.706

and made Clay of the Spittle, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.707

and anointed with the Clay upon the Eyes of the blind Man; As also said
to him, Go, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.708

wash in the Pool of Siloam <paren> which being interpreted is Sent
<$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.709

he went away therefore, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.710

and washed, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.711

and came seeing.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.712

Therefore the Neighbours, and they who had seen before that he was blind,
said, Is not this he that sate, and begged?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.713

Others said, This is he; but others, He is like him:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.714

<font> however <$$font> he said, It is I.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.715

They therefore enquired of him, How were the Eyes opened for thee?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.716

He made answer; A Man called Jesus made Clay, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.717

and anointed my Eyes, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.718

and said to me, Go to the Pool of Siloam, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.719

and wash; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.720

so when I went away, and washed, I had sight.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.721

Therefore they said to him, Where is he?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.722

Says he, I know not.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.723

They bring him to the Pharisees who once was blind.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.724

Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus made the Clay, and opened his Eyes.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.725

The Pharisees therefore asked him also again, how he had sight.
To whom he said, He put Clay upon my Eyes, and I washed, and do see.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.726

Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This Man is not from God, because
he does not keep the Sabbath.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.727

Others said, How can a Man <font> who <$$font> is a Sinner do such
Miracles?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.728

Thus there was a Division among them.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.729

They say to the blind Man again, What dost thou say concerning him,
that he has opened thy Eyes?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.730

But he said, He is a Prophet.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.731

The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he was blind,
and had sight; until they called the Parents of him who had sight,
And asked them as follows, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.732

Is this your Son, of whom you say that he was born blind?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.733

How then does he now see?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,1J.734

<P_9,20J>

His Parents made answer to them; We know that this is our Son, and that
he was born blind.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.736

But how he now sees we know not, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.737

or who opened his Eyes we do not know: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.738

he is of Age, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.739

ask him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.740

he will speak concerning himself.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.741

These Things said his Parents, because they feared the Jews:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.742

for the Jews had already agreed, that if any one did confess
him to be Christ, he should not belong to the Synagogue.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.743

For this reason his Parents said, He is of Age,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.744

ask him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.745

Therefore they called the Man who was blind the second time,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.746

and said to him Ascribe Glory to God; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.747

we know that this Man is a Sinner.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.748

He therefore made answer, Whether he is a Sinner I know not;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.749

one Thing I know, that having been blind, I now see.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.750

Whereupon they said to him again, What did he do to thee?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.751

How opened he thy Eyes?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.752

He answered, I have told you already, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.753

and you did not hearken; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.754

why would you hear again?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.755

Would you also become his Disciples?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.756

They therefore railed at him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.757

and said; Thou art a Disciple of him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.758

but we are Disciples of Moses.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.759

We know that God spoke to Moses; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.760

but we know not whence this Man is.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.761

The Man made reply to them; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.762

In this indeed there is a wonderful Thing, that you know not whence he is,
when he has opened my Eyes.  Since we know that God hears not Sinners;
but if any one be a Worshipper of God, and does his Will, him he hears.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.763

Since the World has been it has not been heard, that any Man opened the
Eyes of one born blind.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.764

If he was not from God, he could not do any Thing.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.765

They made answer to him, Thou wast wholly born in Sins,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.766

and dost thou teach us?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.767

So they put him out.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.768

Jesus heard that they put him out, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.769

and finding him, he said to him, Dost thou believe in the Son of God?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.770

He made answer, Who is it, Lord, that I may believe in him?  At which
Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.771

and it is he that talks with thee.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.772

Upon this he said, I believe, Lord; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.773

and worshipped him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.774

Besides Jesus said, For Judgment am I come into this World; that
those who see not may see, and those who see may become blind.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,20J.775

<P_9,40J>

And some of the Pharisees being with him heard these Things,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.777

and said to him, Are we also blind?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.778

Jesus answered them: If you were blind, you would not have Sin;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.779

but now you say, We see; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.780

therefore your Sin remains.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,9,40J.781

<P_10,1J>

<heading>

Chap. X.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.784

<$$heading>

I say to you very certainly; That Person who does not enter at the Gate
into the Sheep-fold, but climbs up elsewhere, is a Thief and a Robber.
Whereas he who enters at the Gate, is the Shepherd of the Sheep.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.786

To him the Porter opens, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.787

and the Sheep hear his Voice; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.788

he also calls his own Sheep by Name, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.789

and brings them out.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.790

And when he puts forth his own Sheep, he goes before them;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.791

moreover the Sheep follow him, because they know his Voice.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.792

Nay they will not follow another at all, but run away from him; because
they know not the Voice of others.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.793

This Proverb Jesus said to them; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.794

yet they did not know what Things those were which he spoke to them.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.795

Jesus therefore said to them again: I tell you very certainly, that I
am the Gate of the Sheep.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.796

All that ever came before me, are Thieves and Robbers;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.797

but the Sheep did not hear them.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.798

I am the Gate: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.799

at me if any one comes in, he shall be saved; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.800

nay shall come in, and go out, and find Pasture.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.801

The Thief does not come, except that he may steal, kill, and destroy:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.802

I am come that they may have Life, and have <font> it <$$font> more
abundantly.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.803

I am the good Shepherd: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.804

it is he yields up his Life for the Sheep.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.805

But he that is a hired one, and not the Shepherd, whose own the Sheep
are not, sees the Wolf coming, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.806

and leaves the Sheep, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.807

and flees; so that the Wolf catches them, and disperses the Sheep.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.808

Thus the hired one flees, because he is hired, and has no Care about
the Sheep.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.809

I am the good Shepherd, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.810

and know mine, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.811

and am known by mine.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.812

As the Father knows me, I also know the Father,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.813

and yield up my Life for the Sheep.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.814

And other Sheep I have that are not of this Fold,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.815

and those I must bring, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.816

and they shall hear what I say; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.817

so there shall be one Sheep-fold, one Shepherd.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.818

For this reason my Father loves me, because I yield up my Life, that I
may receive it again.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.819

None takes it from me, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.820

but I yield it up of my self: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.821

I have Authority to yield it up, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.822

and have Authority to receive it again.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.823

The Commandment for this have I received from my Father.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.824

There was a Division therefore again among the Jews, by these Words.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.825

And many of them said, He has a Devil, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.826

and is mad; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.827

why do ye hear him?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,1J.828

<P_10,20J>

Others said, These are not the Words of one in whom the Devil is;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.830

can a Devil open the Eyes of the Blind?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.831

Now there was the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem, when it was Winter.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.832

And Jesus walked in the Temple, in Solomon's Porch.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.833

The Jews therefore compassed him about, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.834

and said to him, How long dost thou hold our Mind in doubt?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.835

If thou art Christ, tell us freely.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.836

Jesus answered them: I have told you, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.837

and ye did not believe: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.838

those Works which I do in the Name of my Father, testify concerning me.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.839

But ye do not believe: PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.840

for ye are not any of my Sheep, as I told you.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.841

My Sheep hear my Voice, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.842

and I know them, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.843

and they follow me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.844

So I give them everlasting Life, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.845

and they shall not at all perish for ever, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.846

nor shall any one pull them out of my Hand.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.847

My Father who gave to me, is greater than all;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.848

and none can pull out of my Father's Hand.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.849

I and the Father are one.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.850

Therefore the Jews again carried Stones, that they might stone him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.851

Jesus answered them, Many good Works have I shewn you from my Father;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.852

for which of those Works do ye stone me?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.853

The Jews made him answer, We do not stone thee about a good Work, but
about Blasphemy, and because thou that art a Man, makest thy self God.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.854

Jesus replied to them: Is it not written in your Law; I said, You
are gods?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.855

If he called those gods, to whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be disannulled; Do ye tell him whom the Father
has sanctified, and sent into the World, Thou blasphemest; because I said,
I am the Son of God?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.856

If I do not the Works of my Father, believe me not.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.857

But if I do, though you believe me not, believe the Works; that
you may know, and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.858

They therefore sought again to apprehend him, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,20J.859

but he got away from their Hand.  <P_10,40J> When he went away
again beyond Jordan, into the Place where John was first baptizing;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,40J.860

and he remained there.  Whereupon many came to him, and said, John indeed
did no Miracle, but all Things whatever John spoke concerning him were
true.  So that many believed in him there.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,10,40J.861

PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.867

Therefore the Sisters sent Word to him, Lord, behold he whom Thou lovest
is sick.  Which Jesus hearing, said, This Sickness is not to Death,
but for the Glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.868

Moreover Jesus loved Martha, and her Sister, as well as Lazarus.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.869

When he heard therefore that the other was sick, then indeed he remained
at the Place in which he was two Days.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.870

Next he after that says to the Disciples, Let us go along into Judea
again.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.871

The Disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews now have attempted to stone
thee, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.872

and dost thou again go thither?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.873

Jesus answered; Are there not twelve Hours to a Day?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.874

If any one walks in the Day, he does not stumble, because he sees the
Light of this World.  Whereas if any one walks in the Night, he stumbles,
because there is not Light in it.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.875

These Things he said; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.876

and after that he says to them, Our Friend Lazarus is asleep,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.877

but I am going that I may awake him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.878

Therefore his Disciples said, Lord, if he is asleep, he will be well.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.879

But Jesus spoke concerning his Death; whereas they thought that he
discoursed about being in a Sleep.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.880

Then Jesus therefore said to them publickly, Lazarus is dead.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.881

And I am glad by reason of you <paren> in order for you to believe
<$$paren> that I was not there; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.882

but let us go along to him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.883

Therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his Fellow-disciples, Let
us also go along, that we may die with him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.884

Jesus therefore came, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.885

and found he had been four Days already in the Grave.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.886

<paren> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen Furlongs off
<$$paren> PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.887

And many of the Jews were come about Martha and Mary, that they might
comfort them concerning their Brother.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,1J.888

<P_11,20J>

Martha therefore when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.890

but Mary sate in the House.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.891

Therefore Martha said to Jesus; Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my Brother
would not have been dead.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.892

But yet now I know that whatever Thou shalt ask God for, God will
give thee.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.893

Jesus says to her, Thy Brother will arise.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.894

Martha says to him, I know that he will arise in the Resurrection on
the last Day.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.895

Jesus replied to her; I am the Resurrection, and Life:
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.896

he that believes in me will be alive, though he is dead.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.897

And every one who is alive, and believes in me will not die at all for
ever; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.898

dost thou believe this?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.899

She says to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that thou art Christ the Son of God,
who should come into the World.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.900

And having said these Things, she went away, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.901

and called her Sister Mary privately, saying, The Master is come,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.902

and calls for thee.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.903

When she heard, she rose up quickly, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.904

and came to him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.905

However Jesus was not yet come into the Town, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.906

but was in the Place where Martha met him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.907

The Jews therefore who were with her in the House, and were comforting
her, when they saw that Mary arose quickly, and went out, followed
her, saying, She is going to the Grave, that she may weep there.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.908

Therefore when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at
his Feet, saying to him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my Brother would
not have died.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.909

When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who
came with her; he was grieved in Spirit, and affected with Trouble.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.910

At length he asked, Where have you laid him?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.911

They say to him, Lord, come, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.912

and see.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.913

Jesus shed tears.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.914

Therefore the Jews said, Lo how he loved him!
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.915

And some of them said, Could not he who opened the Eyes of one blind, have
caused that he also should not have died?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.916

Jesus therefore again being grieved in himself, comes to the Grave;
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.917

now it was a Cave, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.918

and a Stone lay upon it.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.919

Says Jesus, Take up the Stone.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.920

Martha, the Sister of him who was dead, represents to him, Lord, he has
a scent already, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.921

for it is four Days.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,20J.922

<P_11,40J>

Jesus answers her, Did not I tell thee, that if thou wouldest believe,
thou shouldest see the Glory of God?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.924

Therefore they took up the Stone where the Dead was laid; at which Jesus
looked up above, and said; Father, I give thee thanks, that thou hast
hearkened to me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.925

Yet I knew that Thou always hearkenest to me; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.926

but by reason of the Company standing about I spoke, in order for them
to believe that Thou hast sent me.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.927

And having said these Things, he cried out aloud, Lazarus, come forth.
Whereupon he who was dead came out, bound Feet and Hands with the Grave
cloaths, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.928

and his Face was bound about with a Napkin.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.929

Jesus says to them, Let him loose, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.930

and give <font> him <$$font> liberty to go.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.931

Many of the Jews therefore who came to Mary, and had seen the Things
which Jesus did, believed in him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.932

Some of them notwithstanding went away to the Pharisees,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.933

and told them what Things Jesus had done.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.934

Therefore the chief Priests and Pharisees gathered together the Council,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.935

and said; What do we?  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.936

since this Man does many Miracles.  If we let him alone thus, all will
believe in him; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.937

nay the Romans will come, and take away both our Place and Nation.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.938

Besides Caiaphas a certain one of them, being high Priest that Year,
said to them; You know not any Thing, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.939

Nor consider, that it is profitable to us, that one Man should die for
the People, and not the whole Nation perish.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.940

Nevertheless he did not say this of himself, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.941

but being high Priest that Year, he prophesied that Jesus should die
for the Nation; And not for the Nation only, but that he would also
gather together into one, the Children of God who were dispersed.
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.942

From that Day therefore they consulted together, that they might put
him to death.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.943

Therefore Jesus no more walked publickly among the Jews,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.944

but went away thence into a Country near the Wilderness, to a City called
Ephraim; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.945

and there he abode with his Disciples.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.946

The Passover of the Jews too was near; PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.947

and many went up to Jerusalem from the Country before the Passover,
that they might purify themselves.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.948

They therefore sought for Jesus, PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.949

and talked with one another standing in the Temple,
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.950

What do ye think, that he will not come at all to the Feast?
PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.951

Now both the chief Priests and Pharisees had given Commandment, that
if any one knew where he was, he should declare <font> it <$$font>,
that they might apprehend him.  PURVER-NEW-1764-1,11,40J.952
