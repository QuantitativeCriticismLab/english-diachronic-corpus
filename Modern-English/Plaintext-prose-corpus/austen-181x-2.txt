Chawton AUSTEN-181X-2,454.4

Sunday April 21=st= AUSTEN-181X-2,454.5

My dear Caroline AUSTEN-181X-2,454.6

I am glad to have an opportunity of writing to you again,
AUSTEN-181X-2,454.7

for my last Note was written so long before it was sent, that it seemed
almost good for nothing.  AUSTEN-181X-2,454.8

The note to your Papa is to announce the death of that excellent woman
Miss Eliz=th= Leigh; AUSTEN-181X-2,454.9

it came here this morning enclosed in a letter to Aunt Cassandra.
AUSTEN-181X-2,454.10

We all feel that we have lost a most valued old friend;
AUSTEN-181X-2,454.11

but the death of a person at her advanced age, so fit to die and by her
own feelings so <font> ready <$$font> to die, is not to be regretted.
AUSTEN-181X-2,454.12

She has been so kind as to leave a little remembrance of +L20 to your
Grandmama.  AUSTEN-181X-2,454.13

I have had a letter from Scarlets this morning, with a very tolerable
account of health there.  AUSTEN-181X-2,454.14

We have also heard from Godmersham, AUSTEN-181X-2,454.15

and the day of your Uncle and Fanny's coming is fixed;
AUSTEN-181X-2,454.16

they leave home tomorrow se'night; AUSTEN-181X-2,454.17

spend two days in Town AUSTEN-181X-2,454.18

and are to be with us on Thursday May 2=nd=.  AUSTEN-181X-2,454.19

We are to see your cousin Edward likewise, but probably not quite so soon.
AUSTEN-181X-2,454.20

Your Uncle Henry talks of being in Town <P_455> again on Wednesday.
AUSTEN-181X-2,455.21

He will have spent a complete fortnight at Godmersham,
AUSTEN-181X-2,455.22

and no doubt it will have done him good.  AUSTEN-181X-2,455.23

Tell your Mama that he came back from Steventon much pleased with his
visit to her.  AUSTEN-181X-2,455.24

Your Grandmama is not <font> quite <$$font> well, AUSTEN-181X-2,455.25

she seldom gets through the 24 hours without some pain in her head,
AUSTEN-181X-2,455.26

but we hope it is lessening, and that a continuance of such weather
as may allow her to be out of doors and hard at work every day, will
gradually remove it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,455.27

Cassy has had great pleasure in working <font> this <$$font> - whatever
it may be - for you, AUSTEN-181X-2,455.28

I believe she rather fancied it might do for a quilt for your little
wax doll, AUSTEN-181X-2,455.29

but you will find a use for it if you can I am sure.  AUSTEN-181X-2,455.30

She often <font> talks <$$font> of you AUSTEN-181X-2,455.31

and we should all be very glad to see you again - AUSTEN-181X-2,455.32

and if your Papa comes on Wednesday, as we rather hope, and it suited
everybody that you should come with him, it would give us great pleasure.
AUSTEN-181X-2,455.33

Our Fair at Alton is next Saturday which is also Mary Jane's Birthday,
AUSTEN-181X-2,455.34

and you would be thought an <font> addition <$$font> on such a great day.
AUSTEN-181X-2,455.35

{COM:editorial_material_omitted}

I shall say no more, because I know $there $may $be
{COM:editor's_emendation_from_"th_many"} many circumstances to make it
inconvenient at <P_456> home.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.39

- We are almost ashamed to include your Mama in the invitation, or to
ask <font> her <$$font> to be at the trouble of a long ride for so few
days as we shall be having disengaged, AUSTEN-181X-2,456.40

for we <font> must <$$font> wash before the G=m= Party come
AUSTEN-181X-2,456.41

& therefore Monday would be {COM:sic} last day that our House could be
comfortable for her; AUSTEN-181X-2,456.42

but if she does feel disposed to pay us a little visit & you could <font>
all <$$font> come, so much the better.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.43

- We do not like to <font> invite <$$font> her to come on wednesday,
to be turned out of the house on Monday.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.44

My dear Anna AUSTEN-181X-2,456.47

Cassy desires her best thanks for the book.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.48

She was quite delighted to see it: AUSTEN-181X-2,456.49

I do not know when I have seen her so much struck by anybody's kindness
as on this occasion.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.50

Her sensibility seems to be opening to the perception of great actions.
AUSTEN-181X-2,456.51

These gloves having appeared on the Piano Forte ever since you were here
on Friday, we imagine they must be yours.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.52

Mrs. Digweed returned yesterday through all the afternoon's rain
AUSTEN-181X-2,456.53

and was of course wet through, AUSTEN-181X-2,456.54

but in speaking of it she never once said'It was beyond everything,
'which I am sure it must have been.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.55

Your Mama means to ride to Speen Hill tomorrow to see the Mrs.
Hulberts who are both very indifferent.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.56

By all accounts they really are breaking now.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.57

Not so stout as the old Jackass.  AUSTEN-181X-2,456.58

Tuesday July 9.  1816 AUSTEN-181X-2,457.66

My dear Edward AUSTEN-181X-2,457.67

Many Thanks.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.68

A thank for every Line, & as many to Mr. W. Digweed
for coming.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.69

We have been wanting very much to hear of your Mother,
AUSTEN-181X-2,457.70

& are happy to find she continues to mend, AUSTEN-181X-2,457.71

but her illness must have been a very serious one indeed.
AUSTEN-181X-2,457.72

- When she is really recovered, she ought to try change of air & come
over to us.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.73

- Tell your Father I am very much obliged to him for his share of your
Letter & most sincerely join in the hope of her being eventually much
the better for her present Discipline.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.74

She has the comfort moreover of being confined in such weather as gives
one little temptation to be out.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.75

It is really too bad, AUSTEN-181X-2,457.76

& has been too bad for a long time, much worse than anybody <font>
can <$$font> bear, AUSTEN-181X-2,457.77

& I begin to think it will never be fine again.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.78

This is a finesse of mine, AUSTEN-181X-2,457.79

for I have often observed that if one writes about the weather,
it is generally completely changed before the Letter is read.
AUSTEN-181X-2,457.80

I wish it may prove so now, & that when Mr. W. Digweed
reaches Steventon tomorrow, he may find you have had a long series of hot,
dry weather.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.81

We are a small party at present, only G. Mama, Mary Jane & myself.
AUSTEN-181X-2,457.82

- Yalden's coach cleared off the rest yesterday.  AUSTEN-181X-2,457.83

I suppose it is known at Steventon that Uncle Frank & Aunt Cassandra
were to go to Town <P_458> on some business of Uncle Henry's - & that
Aunt Martha had some business of her own which determined her to go at
the same time; AUSTEN-181X-2,458.84

- but that Aunt Frank determined to go likewise & spend a few days with
her family, may not be known - nor that two other places in the Coach
were taken by Capt. & M=rs= Clement.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.85

- Little Cassy went also, AUSTEN-181X-2,458.86

& does not return at present.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.87

They are all going to Broadstairs again.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.88

- The Aunt Cass: & the Aunt Martha did not mean to stay beyond two whole
days, AUSTEN-181X-2,458.89

but the Uncle Frank & his Wife proposed being pressed to remain till
Saturday.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.90

I am glad you recollected to mention your being come home.
AUSTEN-181X-2,458.91

My heart began to sink within me when I had got so far through your
Letter without its being mentioned.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.92

I was dreadfully afraid that you might be detained at Winchester by severe
illness, confined to your Bed perhaps & quite unable to hold a pen, &
only dating from Steventon in order, with a mistaken sort of Tenderness,
to deceive me.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.93

- But now, I have no doubt of your being at home, AUSTEN-181X-2,458.94

I am sure you would not say it so seriously unless it actually were so.
AUSTEN-181X-2,458.95

- We saw a countless number of Postchaises full of Boys pass by yesterday
morn=g= - full of future Heroes, Legislators, Fools, and Villains.
AUSTEN-181X-2,458.96

- You have never thanked me for my last Letter, which went by the Cheese.
AUSTEN-181X-2,458.97

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear not to be thanked.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.98

You will not pay us a visit yet of course, AUSTEN-181X-2,458.99

we must not think of it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.100

Your Mother must get well first, AUSTEN-181X-2,458.101

& you must go to Oxford and <font> not <$$font> be elected;
AUSTEN-181X-2,458.102

after that, a little change of scene may be good for you,
AUSTEN-181X-2,458.103

& your Physicians I hope will order you to the Sea, or to a house by
the side of a very considerable pond.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.104

Oh!  it rains again; AUSTEN-181X-2,458.105

it beats against the window.  AUSTEN-181X-2,458.106

- Mary <P_459> Jane & I have been wet through once already today,
AUSTEN-181X-2,459.107

we set off in the Donkey Carriage for Farringdon as I wanted to see the
improvements Mr. Woolls is making, AUSTEN-181X-2,459.108

but we were obliged to turn back before we got there, but not soon enough
to avoid a Pelter all the way home.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.109

We met Mr. Woolls - AUSTEN-181X-2,459.110

I talked of $it's being bad weather for the Hay - AUSTEN-181X-2,459.111

& he returned me the comfort of $it's being much worse for the Wheat.
AUSTEN-181X-2,459.112

- We hear that Mrs. S- does not quit Tangier -
AUSTEN-181X-2,459.113

why & wherefore?  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.114

- Do you know that our Browning is gone?  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.115

- You must prepare for a William when you come, a good looking Lad,
civil & quiet, & seeming likely to do.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.116

- Good-bye {TEXT:Good_bye}.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.117

I am sure Mr. W. D. will be astonished at my writing
so much, AUSTEN-181X-2,459.118

for the Paper is so thin that he will be able to count the Lines, if
not to read them.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.119

- Yours affec=ly= J. Austen AUSTEN-181X-2,459.120

My dear James AUSTEN-181X-2,459.121

We suppose the Trial is to take place this week, AUSTEN-181X-2,459.122

but we only feel sure that it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} have taken place
yet because we have heard nothing of it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.123

A letter from G=m= today tells us that <font> Henry <$$font> as well as
William K- goes to France with his Uncle.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.124

{COM:editorial_material_omitted}

My dear Caroline AUSTEN-181X-2,459.128

I have followed your directions AUSTEN-181X-2,459.129

& find your Handwriting admirable.  AUSTEN-181X-2,459.130

If you continue to improve as <P_460> much as you have done, perhaps
I may not be obliged to shut my eyes at all half a year hence.
AUSTEN-181X-2,460.131

I have been very much entertained by your story of Carolina & her aged
Father, AUSTEN-181X-2,460.132

it made me laugh heartily, AUSTEN-181X-2,460.133

& I am particularly glad to find you so much alive upon any topic
of such absurdity, as the usual description of a Heroine's father.
AUSTEN-181X-2,460.134

- You have done it full justice - AUSTEN-181X-2,460.135

or if anything <font> be <$$font> wanting, it is the information of the
venerable old Man's having married when only Twenty one, & being a father
at Twenty two.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.136

I had an early opportunity of conveying your Letter to Mary Jane, having
only to throw it out of {COM:sic} window at her as she was romping with
your Brother in the Back Court.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.137

- She thanks you for it - AUSTEN-181X-2,460.138

& answers your questions through me.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.139

- I am to tell you that she has passed her time at Chawton very pleasantly
indeed, that she does not miss Cassy so much as she expected, & that
as to Diana Temple, she is ashamed to say it has never been worked at
since you went away.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.140

- She is very glad that you found Fanny again.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.141

- I suppose you had worn her in your stays without knowing it, & if she
tickled you, thought it only a flea.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.142

Edward's visit has been a great pleasure to us.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.143

He has not lost one good quality or good Look, AUSTEN-181X-2,460.144

& is only altered in being improved by being some months older than when
we saw him last.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.145

He is getting very near our own age, AUSTEN-181X-2,460.146

for we do not grow older of course.  AUSTEN-181X-2,460.147

Letter today.  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.153

His not writing on friday gave me some AUSTEN-181X-2,461.154

{COM:room_for_12_letters} coming makes me more than amends.
AUSTEN-181X-2,461.155

- I know you heard from Edward yesterday, AUSTEN-181X-2,461.156

Henry wrote to me by the same post, AUSTEN-181X-2,461.157

& so did Fanny - AUSTEN-181X-2,461.158

I had therefore 3 Letters at once which I thought well worth paying for!
AUSTEN-181X-2,461.159

Yours was a treasure, so full of everything.  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.160

- But how very much Cheltenham is to be preferred in May!
AUSTEN-181X-2,461.161

- Henry does not write diffusely, but chearfully; AUSTEN-181X-2,461.162

- at present he wishes to come to us as soon as we can receive him -
AUSTEN-181X-2,461.163

is decided for Orders &c. - AUSTEN-181X-2,461.164

I have written to him to say that after this week, he $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} come too soon.  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.165

- I do not really expect him however immediately; AUSTEN-181X-2,461.166

they will hardly part with him at G=m= yet.  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.167

- Fanny does not seem any better, or very little; AUSTEN-181X-2,461.168

she ventured to dine one day at Sandling AUSTEN-181X-2,461.169

& has suffered for it ever since.  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.170

- I collect from her, that M=r= Seymour is either married or on the
point of being married to M=rs= Scrane.  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.171

- She is not explicit, because imagining us to be informed.
AUSTEN-181X-2,461.172

I am glad I did not know that you had no possibility of having a fire
on saturday - & so glad that you have your Pelisse!  AUSTEN-181X-2,461.173

- Your Bed room describes more comfortably than I could have supposed.
AUSTEN-181X-2,461.174

- We go on very well here, AUSTEN-181X-2,461.175

Edward is a great pleasure to me; AUSTEN-181X-2,461.176

- he drove me to Alton yesterday; AUSTEN-181X-2,461.177

I went principally to carry news of you & Henry, AUSTEN-181X-2,461.178

& <P_462> made a regular handsome visit, staying there while Edw=d=
went on to Wyards with an invitation to dinner; AUSTEN-181X-2,462.179

it was declined, AUSTEN-181X-2,462.180

& will be so again today probably, AUSTEN-181X-2,462.181

for I really beleive {COM:sic} Anna is not equal to the fatigue.
AUSTEN-181X-2,462.182

- The Alton 4 drank tea with us last night, AUSTEN-181X-2,462.183

& we were very pleasant: - Jeu de violon &c. - all new to
Mr. Sweney - AUSTEN-181X-2,462.184

& he entered into it very well.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.185

It was a renewal of former agreable evenings.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.186

- We all <paren> except my Mother <$$paren> dine at Alton tomorrow -
AUSTEN-181X-2,462.187

& perhaps may have some of the same sports again - AUSTEN-181X-2,462.188

but I do not think M=r= and M=rs= D. will add much to our wit.
AUSTEN-181X-2,462.189

- Edward is writing a Novel - AUSTEN-181X-2,462.190

we have all heard what he has written - AUSTEN-181X-2,462.191

it is extremely clever; written with great ease and spirit;
AUSTEN-181X-2,462.192

if he can carry it on in the same way, it will be a first-rate work, &
in a style, I think, to be popular.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.193

Pray tell Mary how much I admire it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.194

- And tell Caroline that I think it is hardly fair upon her & myself,
to have him take up the Novel Line, AUSTEN-181X-2,462.195

...  but the coldness of the weather is enough to account for their want
of power.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.196

- The Duchess of Orleans, the paper says, drinks at my Pump.
AUSTEN-181X-2,462.197

Your Library will be a great resource.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.198

- Three Guineas a week for such Lodgings!  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.199

- I am quite angry.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.200

Martha desires her Love - AUSTEN-181X-2,462.201

& is sorry to tell you that she has got some Chilblains on her fingers -
AUSTEN-181X-2,462.202

she never had them before.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.203

- This is to go for a Letter.  AUSTEN-181X-2,462.204

Chawton, AUSTEN-181X-2,463.210

Sunday Sept: 8.  AUSTEN-181X-2,463.211

My dearest Cassandra AUSTEN-181X-2,463.212

I have borne the arrival of your Letter today extremely well;
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.213

anybody might have thought it was giving me pleasure.
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.214

- I am very glad you find so much to be satisfied with at Cheltenham.
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.215

While the Waters agree, everything else is trifling.
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.216

- A letter arrived for you from Charles last Thursday.
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.217

They are all safe, & pretty well in Keppel S=t=, the children decidedly
better for Broadstairs, AUSTEN-181X-2,463.218

& he writes principally to ask when it will be convenient to us to receive
Miss P. - the little girls & himself.  AUSTEN-181X-2,463.219

They w=d= be ready to set off in ten days from the time of his writing,
to pay their visits in Hampshire & Berkshire - AUSTEN-181X-2,463.220

& he would prefer coming to Chawton <font> first.  <$$font>
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.221

I have answered him AUSTEN-181X-2,463.222

& said, that we hoped it might suit them to wait till the <font> last
<$$font> week in Sept=r=, as we could not ask them sooner, either on
your account, or the want of room.  AUSTEN-181X-2,463.223

I mentioned the 23=d=, as the probable day of your return.
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.224

When you have once left Cheltenham, I shall grudge every half day wasted
on the road.  AUSTEN-181X-2,463.225

If there were but a coach from Hungerford to Chawton!
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.226

- I have desired him to let me hear again soon.  AUSTEN-181X-2,463.227

- He does not include a Maid in the list to be accomodated {COM:sic}
, AUSTEN-181X-2,463.228

but if they bring one, as I suppose they will, we shall have no
bed in the house even then for Charles himself - let alone Henry -.
AUSTEN-181X-2,463.229

But what can we do?  AUSTEN-181X-2,463.230

- We shall have the G=t= House quite at our <P_464> command;
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.231

it is to be cleared of the Papillons'Servants in a day or two;
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.232

- they themselves have been hurried off into Essex to take possession -
not of a large Estate left them by an Uncle - but to scrape together all
they can I suppose of the effects of a Mrs. Rawstorn a rich old
friend & cousin, suddenly deceased, to whom they are joint Executors.
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.233

So, there is a happy end of the Kentish Papillons coming here.
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.234

No morning service today, wherefore I am writing between 12 & 1 o'clock.
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.235

- Mr. Benn in the afternoon - & likewise more rain again, by the
look & the sound of things.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.236

You left us in doubt of Mrs. Benn's situation,
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.237

but she has bespoke her Nurse.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.238

- Mrs. F. A. seldom either looks or appears quite
well.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.239

- Little Embryo is troublesome I suppose.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.240

- They dined with us yesterday, AUSTEN-181X-2,464.241

& had fine weather both for coming & going home, which has hardly ever
happened to them before.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.242

- She is still unprovided with a Housemaid.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.243

Our day at Alton was very pleasant - Venison quite right - Children
well-behaved - & Mr. & Mrs. Digweed taking kindly to our
Charades, & other Games.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.244

- I must also observe, for his Mother's satisfaction, that Edward at my
suggestion, devoted himself very properly to the entertainment of Miss
S. Gibson.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.245

- Nothing was wanting except Mr. Sweney; AUSTEN-181X-2,464.246

but he alas!  had been ordered away to London the day before.
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.247

- We had a beautiful walk home by Moonlight.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.248

- Thank you, my Back has given me scarcely any pain for many days.
AUSTEN-181X-2,464.249

I have an idea that agitation does it as much harm as fatigue, & that
I was ill at the time of your going, from the very circumstance of
your going.  AUSTEN-181X-2,464.250

- I am nursing myself up now into as beautiful a state as I can, because
I hear that Dr. <P_465> White means to call on me before he leaves
the Country.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.251

- <font> Even=g=.  <$$font> AUSTEN-181X-2,465.252

- Frank & Mary & the Child=n= visited us this morn=g=.
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.253

Mr. & Mrs. Gibson are to come on the 23=d= -
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.254

& there is too much reason to fear they will stay above a week.
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.255

- Little George could tell me where you were gone to, as well as what you
were to bring him, when I asked him the other day.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.256

- Sir Tho: Miller is dead.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.257

I treat you with a dead Baronet in almost every Letter.
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.258

- So, you have C. Craven among you, as well as the Duke of Orleans
& Mr. Pococke.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.259

But it mortifies me that <font> you <$$font> have not added one to the
stock of common acquaintance.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.260

Do pray meet with somebody belonging to yourself.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.261

- I am quite weary of your knowing nobody.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.262

- Mrs. Digweed parts with both Hannah and old Cook,
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.263

the former will not give up her Lover, who is a man of bad Character,
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.264

the Latter is guilty only of being unequal to anything.
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.265

- Miss Terry was to have spent this week with her Sister,
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.266

but as usual it is put off.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.267

My amiable friend knows the value of her company.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.268

- I have not seen Anna since the day you left us, AUSTEN-181X-2,465.269

her Father & Brother visited her most days.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.270

- Edward & Ben called here on Thursday.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.271

Edward was in his way to Selborne.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.272

We found him very agreable.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.273

He is come back from France, thinking of the French as one could wish,
disappointed in everything.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.274

He did not go beyond Paris.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.275

- I have a letter from Mrs. Perigord, AUSTEN-181X-2,465.276

she & her Mother are in London again; AUSTEN-181X-2,465.277

- she speaks of France as a scene of general Poverty & Misery, - no Money,
no Trade - nothing to be got but by the Innkeepers - AUSTEN-181X-2,465.278

& as to her own present prospects, she is not much less melancholy
than before.  AUSTEN-181X-2,465.279

- I have also a letter from Miss Sharp, quite one of her Letters;
AUSTEN-181X-2,465.280

<P_466>

- she has been again obliged to exert herself - more than ever - in a
more distressing, more harrassed state - AUSTEN-181X-2,466.282

& has met with another excellent old Physician & his wife, with every
virtue under Heaven, who takes to her & cures her from pure Love &
Benevolence.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.283

- Dr. & Mrs. Storer are <font> their <$$font> Mrs. &
Miss Palmer - AUSTEN-181X-2,466.284

for they are at Bridlington.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.285

I am happy to say however that the sum of the account is better than
usual.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.286

Sir William is returned; AUSTEN-181X-2,466.287

from Bridlington they go to Chevet, AUSTEN-181X-2,466.288

& she <font> is <$$font> to have a Young Governess under her.
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.289

- I enjoyed Edward's company very much, as I said before,
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.290

& yet I was not sorry when friday came.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.291

It had been a busy week, AUSTEN-181X-2,466.292

& I wanted a few days quiet, & exemption from the Thought & contrivances
which any sort of company gives.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.293

- I often wonder how <font> you <$$font> can find time for what you do,
in addition to the care of the House; AUSTEN-181X-2,466.294

- and how good Mrs. West c=d= have written such Books & collected
so many hard words, with all her family cares, is still more a matter
of astonishment!  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.295

Composition seems to me Impossible, with a head full of Joints of Mutton &
doses of rhubarb.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.296

- <font> Monday.  <$$font> AUSTEN-181X-2,466.297

- Here is a sad morn=g=.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.298

- I fear you may not have been able to get to the Pump.
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.299

The two last days were very pleasant.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.300

- I enjoyed them the more for your sake.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.301

But today, it is really bad enough to make you all cross.
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.302

- I hope Mary will change her Lodgings at the fortnight's end;
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.303

I am sure, if you looked about well, you would find others in some odd
corner, to suit you better.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.304

Mrs. Potter charges for the <font> name <$$font> of the High S=t=.
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.305

- Success to the Pianoforte!  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.306

I trust it will drive you away.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.307

- We hear now that there is to be <font> no Honey <$$font> this year.
AUSTEN-181X-2,466.308

Bad news for us.  AUSTEN-181X-2,466.309

- We must husband our present stock of Mead; AUSTEN-181X-2,466.310

<P_467>

- & I am sorry to perceive that our 20 Gal: is very nearly out.
AUSTEN-181X-2,467.312

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} comprehend how the 14 Gal: c=d= last so long.
AUSTEN-181X-2,467.313

We do not much like Mr. Cooper's new Sermons; AUSTEN-181X-2,467.314

- they are fuller of Regeneration & Conversion than ever - with
the addition of his zeal in the cause of the Bible Society.
AUSTEN-181X-2,467.315

- Martha's love to Mary & Caroline, & she is extremely glad to find they
like the Pelisse.  AUSTEN-181X-2,467.316

- The Debarys are indeed odious!  AUSTEN-181X-2,467.317

- - We are to see my Brother tomorrow, but for only one night.
AUSTEN-181X-2,467.318

- I had no idea that he would care for the Races, <font> without <$$font>
Edward.  AUSTEN-181X-2,467.319

Chawton, AUSTEN-181X-2,467.324

Monday Dec: 16.  AUSTEN-181X-2,467.325

My dear Edward AUSTEN-181X-2,467.326

One reason for my writing to you now, is that I may have the pleasure
of directing to you <font> Esq=re=.  <$$font> AUSTEN-181X-2,467.327

- I give you Joy of having left Winchester.  AUSTEN-181X-2,467.328

- Now you may own, how miserable you were there; AUSTEN-181X-2,467.329

now, it will gradually all come out - your Crimes & your Miseries -
how often you went up by the Mail to London & threw away Fifty Guineas
at a Tavern, & how often you were on the point of hanging yourself -
restrained only, as some illnatured aspersion upon poor old <P_468>
Winton has it, by the want of a Tree within some miles of the City.
AUSTEN-181X-2,468.330

- Charles Knight & his companions passed through Chawton about 9 this
morning; later than it used to be.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.331

Uncle Henry and I had a glimpse of his handsome face, looking all health
& good-humour.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.332

- I wonder when you will come & see us.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.333

I know what I rather speculate upon, AUSTEN-181X-2,468.334

but I shall say nothing.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.335

- We think Uncle Henry in excellent Looks.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.336

Look at him this moment AUSTEN-181X-2,468.337

& think so too, if you have not done it before; AUSTEN-181X-2,468.338

& we have the great comfort of seeing decided improvement in Uncle
Charles , both as to Health, Spirits & Appearance.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.339

- And they are each of them so agreable in their different way,
AUSTEN-181X-2,468.340

& harmonize so well, that their visit is thorough enjoyment.
AUSTEN-181X-2,468.341

- Uncle Henry writes very superior Sermons.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.342

- You and I must try to get hold of one or two, & put them into our
Novels; AUSTEN-181X-2,468.343

- it would be a fine help to a volume; AUSTEN-181X-2,468.344

& we could make our Heroine read it aloud of a Sunday Evening, just as
well as Isabella Wardour in the Antiquary, is made to read the History
of the Hartz Demon in the ruins of St. Ruth - though I beleive,
upon recollection, Lovell is the Reader.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.345

- By the bye, my dear Edward, I am quite concerned for the loss your
Mother mentions in her Letter; AUSTEN-181X-2,468.346

two Chapters & a half to be missing is monstrous!  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.347

It is well that <font> I <$$font> have not been at Steventon lately,
& therefore $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be suspected of purloining them;
AUSTEN-181X-2,468.348

- two strong twigs & a half towards a Nest of my own, would have been
something.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.349

- I do not think however that any theft of that sort would be really
very useful to me.  AUSTEN-181X-2,468.350

What should I do with your strong, manly, spirited Sketches, full of
Variety and <P_469> Glow?  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.351

- How could I possibly join them on to the little bit <paren> two Inches
wide <$$paren> of Ivory on which I work with so fine a Brush, as produces
little effect after much labour?  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.352

You will hear from uncle Henry how well Anna is.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.353

She seems perfectly recovered.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.354

- Ben was here on Saturday, to ask Uncle Charles & me to dine with them,
as tomorrow, AUSTEN-181X-2,469.355

but I was forced to decline it, AUSTEN-181X-2,469.356

the walk is beyond my strength <paren> though I am otherwise very well
<$$paren> AUSTEN-181X-2,469.357

& this is not a Season for Donkey Carriages; AUSTEN-181X-2,469.358

& as we do not like to spare Uncle Charles, he has declined it too.
AUSTEN-181X-2,469.359

- Tuesday.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.360

Ah, ha!  - M=r= Edward, I doubt your seeing Uncle Henry at Steventon
today.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.361

The weather will prevent your expecting him I think.
AUSTEN-181X-2,469.362

- Tell your Father, with Aunt Cass:'s {COM:sic} Love & mine, that the
Pickled Cucumbers are extremely good, AUSTEN-181X-2,469.363

& tell him also -'tell him what you will'; AUSTEN-181X-2,469.364

No, $do $n't {TEXT:do'nt} {COM:sic} tell him what you will,
AUSTEN-181X-2,469.365

but tell him that Grandmama begs him to make Joseph Hall pay his Rent
if he can.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.366

You must not be tired of reading the word <font> Uncle, <$$font>
AUSTEN-181X-2,469.367

for I have not done with it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.368

Uncle Charles thanks your Mother for her Letter; AUSTEN-181X-2,469.369

it was a great pleasure to him to know the parcel was received & gave
so much satisfaction; AUSTEN-181X-2,469.370

& he begs her to be so good as to give <font> Three Shillings <$$font>
for him to $Dame Staples, which shall be allowed for in the payment of
her debt here.  AUSTEN-181X-2,469.371

- I am happy to tell you that Mr. Papillon will soon
make his offer, probably next Monday, as he returns on Saturday.
AUSTEN-181X-2,469.372

- His <font> intention <$$font> can be no longer doubtful in the smallest
degree, as he has secured the refusal of the House which M=rs= Baverstock
at present occupies <P_470> in Chawton & is to vacate soon, which is of
course intended for M=rs= Eliz=th= Papillon.  AUSTEN-181X-2,470.373

Such Highmindedness is almost more than she can bear.

Thursday Jan: 23.  1817 - AUSTEN-181X-2,471.411

My dear Caroline AUSTEN-181X-2,471.412

I am always very much obliged to you for writing to me,
AUSTEN-181X-2,471.413

& have now I beleive {COM:sic} two or three Notes to thank you for;
AUSTEN-181X-2,471.414

but whatever may be their Number, I mean to have this Letter accepted
as a handsome return for all, AUSTEN-181X-2,471.415

for you see I have taken a complete, whole sheet of Paper, which is to
entitle me to consider it as a very long Letter whether I write much
or little.  AUSTEN-181X-2,471.416

- We were quite happy to see Edward, AUSTEN-181X-2,471.417

it was an unexpected pleasure, AUSTEN-181X-2,471.418

& he makes himself as agreable as ever, sitting in such a
quiet comfortable way making his delightful little Sketches.
AUSTEN-181X-2,471.419

- He is generally thought grown since he was here last, & rather Thinner ,
but in very good Looks.  AUSTEN-181X-2,471.420

- We have used Anna as ill as we could, by not letting him leave us
before tomorrow morning, AUSTEN-181X-2,471.421

but it is a Vile World, AUSTEN-181X-2,471.422

we <P_472> are all for Self AUSTEN-181X-2,472.423

& I expected no better from any of us.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.424

But though <font> Better <$$font> is not to be expected, <font> Butter
<$$font> may, at least from M=rs= Clement's Cow, AUSTEN-181X-2,472.425

for she has sold her Calf.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.426

- Edward will tell you of the Grand Evening Party he has come in for.
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.427

We were proud to have a young Man to accompany us, AUSTEN-181X-2,472.428

& he acquitted himself to admiration in every particular except selling
his Deals at Vingt-un.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.429

- He read his two Chapters to us the first Evening; - both good - but
especially the last in our opinion.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.430

We think it has more of the Spirit & Entertainment of the early part
of his Work, the first 3 or 4 Chapters, than some of the subsequent.
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.431

- M=r= Reeves is charming - & M=r= Mountain - & M=r= Fairfax - & all
their day's sport.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.432

And the introduction of Emma Gordon is very amusing.
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.433

- I certainly <font> do <$$font> altogether like this set of People
better than those at Culver Court.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.434

Your Anne is dreadful.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.435

But nothing offends me so much as the absurdity of not being able to
pronounce the word <font> Shift.  <$$font> AUSTEN-181X-2,472.436

I could forgive her any follies in English, rather than the Mock Modesty
of that french word.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.437

She should not only place her Quilt in the Centre, but give it's Latitude
& Longitude, & measure its Dimensions by a Lunar Observation if she chose.
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.438

- Cook & Sally seem very properly pleased by your remembrance,
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.439

& desire their Duty & Thanks.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.440

Sally has got a new red Cloak, which adds much to her happiness,
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.441

in other respects she is unaltered, as civil & well meaning & talkative
as ever.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.442

- Only think of your lost Dormouse being brought back to you!
AUSTEN-181X-2,472.443

- I was quite astonished.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.444

- No time is fixed for Cassy's return, AUSTEN-181X-2,472.445

but <font> March <$$font> has always been her month hitherto for coming
down.  AUSTEN-181X-2,472.446

Aunt Cass:- had a letter from her <P_473> very lately, extremely well
written in a large hand, but as you may suppose containing little beyond
her hope of every body's being well at Chawton, & Harriet & $Fanny $'s
{TEXT:Fanny's} love.  AUSTEN-181X-2,473.447

Uncle Charles, I am sorry to say, has been suffering from Rheumatism,

& now he has got a great eruption in his face & neck - which is to do
him good however - AUSTEN-181X-2,473.449

but he has a sad turn for being unwell.  AUSTEN-181X-2,473.450

- <font> I <$$font> feel myself getting stronger than I was half a year
ago, AUSTEN-181X-2,473.451

& can so perfectly well walk to Alton, <font> or <$$font> back again,
without the slightest fatigue that I hope to be able to do both when
Summer comes.  AUSTEN-181X-2,473.452

- I spent two or three days with your Uncle & Aunt lately,
AUSTEN-181X-2,473.453

& though the Children are sometimes very noisy & not under such Order as
they ought & easily might, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help liking them &
even loving them, which I hope may be not wholly inexcusable in their &
$your $affectionate $Aunt, $J. $Austen AUSTEN-181X-2,473.454

The Piano Forte` often talks of you; - in various keys, tunes, &
expressions I allow - AUSTEN-181X-2,473.455

but be it Lesson or Country Dance, Sonata or Waltz, <font> you <$$font>
are really it's {COM:sic} constant Theme.  AUSTEN-181X-2,473.456

You send me great News indeed my dear Caroline, about M=r= Digweed M=r=
Trimmer, & a Grand Piano Forte.  AUSTEN-181X-2,473.460

I wish it had been a small one, as then you <P_474> might have pretended
that M=r= D.'s rooms were too damp to be fit for it, & offered to take
charge of it at the Parsonage.  AUSTEN-181X-2,474.461

- I am sorry to hear of Caroline Wiggetts being so ill.
AUSTEN-181X-2,474.462

M=rs= Chute I suppose would almost feel like a Mother in losing her.
AUSTEN-181X-2,474.463

- We have but a poor account of your Uncle Charles {COM:sic} 2=d= Girl;
AUSTEN-181X-2,474.464

there is an idea now of her having Water in her head.
AUSTEN-181X-2,474.465

The others are well.  AUSTEN-181X-2,474.466

- William was mistaken when he told your Mama we did not mean to mourn
for M=rs= Motley Austen.  AUSTEN-181X-2,474.467

Living here we thought it necessary to array ourselves in our old Black
Gowns, because there is a line of Connection with the family through
the Prowtings & Harrisons of Southampton.  AUSTEN-181X-2,474.468

- I look forward to the 4 new Chapters with pleasure.
AUSTEN-181X-2,474.469

- But how can you like Frederick better than Edgar - AUSTEN-181X-2,474.470

You have some eccentric Tastes however I know, as to Heroes & Heroines.

Jan=y= 24 - 1817 AUSTEN-181X-2,474.478

My dear Alethea AUSTEN-181X-2,474.479

I think it time there should be a little writing between us, though I
believe the epistolary debt is on <font> your <$$font> side, and I hope
this will find all the Streatham party well, neither carried away by
the flood, nor rheumatic through the damps.  AUSTEN-181X-2,474.480

Such mild weather is, <P_475> you know, delightful to <font> us, <$$font>
AUSTEN-181X-2,475.481

and though we have a great many ponds, and a fine running stream
through the meadows on the other side of the road, it is nothing but
what beautifies us and does to talk of.  AUSTEN-181X-2,475.482

We are all in good health AUSTEN-181X-2,475.483

& I have certainly gained strength through the winter
AUSTEN-181X-2,475.484

and am not far from being well; AUSTEN-181X-2,475.485

and I think I understand my own case now so much better than I did,
as to be able by care to keep off any serious return of illness.
AUSTEN-181X-2,475.486

I am more & more convinced that <font> bile <$$font> is at the bottom
of all I have suffered, which makes it easy to know how to treat myself.
AUSTEN-181X-2,475.487

You will be glad to hear thus much of me, I am sure as I shall in
return be very glad to hear that your health has been good lately.
AUSTEN-181X-2,475.488

We have just had a few days'visit from Edward, who brought us a good
account of his father, AUSTEN-181X-2,475.489

and the very circumstance of his coming at all, of his father's being
able to spare him, is itself a good account.  AUSTEN-181X-2,475.490

He is gone to spend this day at Wyards AUSTEN-181X-2,475.491

& goes home to-morrow.  AUSTEN-181X-2,475.492

He grows still, AUSTEN-181X-2,475.493

and still improves in appearance, at least in the estimation of his aunts
, who love him better and better, as they see the sweet temper and warm
affections of the boy confirmed in the young man: AUSTEN-181X-2,475.494

I tried hard to persuade him that he must have some message for William,
but in vain.  AUSTEN-181X-2,475.495

Anna has not been so well or so strong or looking so much like herself
since her marriage as she is now; AUSTEN-181X-2,475.496

she is quite equal to walking to Chawton, AUSTEN-181X-2,475.497

& comes over to us when she can, AUSTEN-181X-2,475.498

but the rain & dirt divide us a good deal.  AUSTEN-181X-2,475.499

Her grandmama she can only see at Chawton as this is not a time of
year for donkey-carriages, and our donkeys are necessarily having so
long a run of luxurious idleness that I suppose we shall find they
have forgotten <P_476> much of their education when we use them again.
AUSTEN-181X-2,476.500

We do not use two at once however; AUSTEN-181X-2,476.501

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} imagine such excesses.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.502

Anna's eldest child just now runs alone, which is a great convenience
with a second in arms, AUSTEN-181X-2,476.503

& they are both healthy nice children - AUSTEN-181X-2,476.504

I wish their Father were ordained & all the family settled in a
comfortable Parsonage house.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.505

The Curacy only is wanting I fancy to complete the business.
AUSTEN-181X-2,476.506

Our own new clergyman is expected here very soon, perhaps in time to
assist Mr. Papillon on Sunday.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.507

I shall be very glad when the first hearing is over.
AUSTEN-181X-2,476.508

It will be a nervous hour for our pew, though we hear that he acquits
himself with as much ease and collectedness, as if he had been used to
it all his life.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.509

We have no chance we know of seeing you between Streatham and Winchester
: AUSTEN-181X-2,476.510

you go the other road AUSTEN-181X-2,476.511

and are engaged to two or three houses; AUSTEN-181X-2,476.512

if there should be any change, however, you know how welcome you would be.
AUSTEN-181X-2,476.513

Edward mentioned one circumstance concerning you my dear Alethea, which
I must confess has given me considerable astonishment & some alarm -
your having left your best gown at Steventon.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.514

Surely if you do not want it at Streatham, you will be spending a few
days with M=rs= G. Frere, AUSTEN-181X-2,476.515

& must want it there.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.516

I would lay any wager that you have been sorry you left it.
AUSTEN-181X-2,476.517

We have been reading the'Poet's Pilgrimage to Waterloo,'and generally
with much approbation.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.518

Nothing will please all the world, you know; AUSTEN-181X-2,476.519

but parts of it suit me better than much that he has written before.
AUSTEN-181X-2,476.520

The opening - <font> the proem <$$font> I believe he calls it - is
very beautiful.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.521

Poor man!  one $can $not {TEXT:cannot} but grieve for the loss of the
son so fondly described.  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.522

Has he at all recovered it?  AUSTEN-181X-2,476.523

What do Mr. and Mrs. <P_477> Hill know about his present
state?  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.524

I hear from more than one quarter that Miss Williams is really better,
AUSTEN-181X-2,477.525

& I am very glad, especially as Charlotte's being better also must I
think be the consequence of it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.526

I hope your letters from abroad are satisfactory.  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.527

They would not be satisfactory to <font> me <$$font>, I confess, unless
they breathed a strong spirit of regret for not being in England.
AUSTEN-181X-2,477.528

Kind love & good wishes for a happy New Year to you all, from all our
four here.  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.529

Give our love to the little Boys, if they can be persuaded to remember us.
AUSTEN-181X-2,477.530

<font> We <$$font> have not at all forgot Herbert's & Errol's fine
countenances.  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.531

Georgiana is very pretty I daresay.  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.532

How does Edward like school?  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.533

- I suppose his holidays are $not {TEXT:now} over yet.

The real object of this letter is to ask you for a receipt,
AUSTEN-181X-2,477.536

but I thought it genteel not to let it appear early.
AUSTEN-181X-2,477.537

We remember some excellent orange wine at Manydown, made from Seville
oranges, entirely or chiefly AUSTEN-181X-2,477.538

& should be very much obliged to you for the receipt, if you can command
it within a few weeks.  AUSTEN-181X-2,477.539

Feb: 20 AUSTEN-181X-2,478.544

My dearest Fanny, You are inimitable, irresistable.  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.545

You are the delight of my Life.  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.546

Such Letters, such entertaining Letters as you have lately sent!  -
Such a description of your queer little heart!  - Such a lovely display
of what Imagination does.  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.547

You are worth your weight in Gold, or even in the new Silver Coinage.
AUSTEN-181X-2,478.548

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} express to you what I have felt in reading
your history of yourself, how full of Pity & Concern & Admiration &
Amusement I have been.  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.549

You are the Paragon of all that is Silly & Sensible, common-place &
eccentric, Sad & Lively, Provoking & Interesting.  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.550

- Who can keep pace with the fluctuations of your Fancy, the Capprizios
of your Taste, the Contradictions of your Feelings?  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.551

- You are so odd!  - & all the time, so perfectly natural - so peculiar
in yourself, & yet so like everybody else!  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.552

- It is very, very gratifying to me to know you so intimately.
AUSTEN-181X-2,478.553

You can hardly think what a pleasure it is to me, to have such thorough
pictures of your Heart.  AUSTEN-181X-2,478.554

Oh!  what a loss it will be when <P_479> you are married.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.555

You are too agreable in your single state, too agreable as a Neice.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.556

I shall hate you when your delicious play of Mind is all settled down
into conjugal & maternal affections.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.557

Mr. J. W. frightens me.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.558

- He will have you.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.559

- I see you at the Altar.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.560

- I have <font> some <$$font> faith in Mrs. C. Cage's
observation, & still more in Lizzy's; AUSTEN-181X-2,479.561

& besides, I know it <font> must <$$font> be so.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.562

He must be wishing to attach you.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.563

It would be too stupid & too shameful in him, to be otherwise;
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.564

& all the Family are seeking your acquaintance.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.565

- Do not imagine that I have any real objection, AUSTEN-181X-2,479.566

I have rather taken a fancy to him than not, AUSTEN-181X-2,479.567

& I like Chilham Castle for you; AUSTEN-181X-2,479.568

- I only do not like you sh=d= marry anybody.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.569

And yet I do wish you to marry very much, because I know you will never
be happy till you are; AUSTEN-181X-2,479.570

but the loss of a Fanny Knight will be never made up to me;
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.571

My'affec: Neice F. C. Wildman'will be but a poor Substitute.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.572

I do not like your being nervous & so apt to cry: AUSTEN-181X-2,479.573

- it is a sign you are not quite well, AUSTEN-181X-2,479.574

but I hope Mr. Scud - as you always write his name, <paren>
your Mr. <font> Scuds: <$$font> amuse me very much <$$paren>
will do you good.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.575

- What a comfort that Cassandra should be so recovered!
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.576

- It is more than we had expected.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.577

- I can easily beleive she was very patient & very good.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.578

I always loved Cassandra, for her fine dark eyes & sweet temper.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.579

- I am almost entirely cured of my rheumatism; AUSTEN-181X-2,479.580

just a little pain in my knee now and then, to make me remember what it
was, & keep on flannel.  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.581

- Aunt Cassandra nursed me so beautifully!  AUSTEN-181X-2,479.582

- I enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, AUSTEN-181X-2,479.583

it must be a great pleasure to you, AUSTEN-181X-2,479.584

You have not seen Fanny Cage in any comfort so long.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.585

I hope she represents & remonstrates & reasons with you, properly.
AUSTEN-181X-2,479.586

Why <P_480> should you be living in dread of his marrying somebody else?
AUSTEN-181X-2,480.587

- <paren> Yet, how natural!  <$$paren> AUSTEN-181X-2,480.588

- You did not chuse to have him yourself; AUSTEN-181X-2,480.589

why not allow him to take comfort where he can?  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.590

- In your conscience you <font> know <$$font> that he could not bear a
comparison with a more animated Character.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.591

You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forget how you felt under the idea of it's
{COM:sic} having been possible that he might have dined in Hans Place.
AUSTEN-181X-2,480.592

- My dearest Fanny, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear you should be unhappy
about him.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.593

Think of his Principles, AUSTEN-181X-2,480.594

think of his Father's objection, of want of Money, of a coarse Mother
, of Brothers & Sisters like Horses, of sheets sewn across &c.
AUSTEN-181X-2,480.595

But I am doing no good - AUSTEN-181X-2,480.596

no, all that I urge against him will rather make you take his part more,
sweet perverse Fanny.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.597

- And now I will tell you that we like your Henry to the utmost, to the
very top of the Glass, quite brimful.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.598

- He is a very pleasing young Man.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.599

I do not see how he could be mended.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.600

He does really bid fair to be everything his Father and Sister could
wish; AUSTEN-181X-2,480.601

and William I love very much indeed, AUSTEN-181X-2,480.602

& so we do all, AUSTEN-181X-2,480.603

he is quite our own William.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.604

In short we are very comfortable together - that is, we can answer for
<font> ourselves.  <$$font> AUSTEN-181X-2,480.605

- Mrs. Deedes is as welcome as May, to all our Benevolence to
her Son; AUSTEN-181X-2,480.606

we only lamented that we c=d= not do more, & that the +L50 note we slipt
into his hand at parting was necessarily the Limit of our Offering.
AUSTEN-181X-2,480.607

- Good Mrs. Deedes!  - I hope she will get the better of this
Marianne, AUSTEN-181X-2,480.608

& then I w=d= recommend to her & Mr. D. the simple regimen
of separate rooms.  AUSTEN-181X-2,480.609

but I am very fond of Mrs. C. Cage, for reasons good.

but I have written away my foolish thoughts at such a rate that
I will not keep them many hours longer to stare me in the face.
AUSTEN-181X-2,481.618

Much obliged for the <font> Quadrilles, <$$font> which I am grown to
think pretty enough, though of course they are very inferior to the
Cotillions of my own day.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.619

- Ben & Anna walked here last Sunday to hear Uncle Henry,
AUSTEN-181X-2,481.620

& she looked so pretty, it was quite a pleasure to see her, so young &
so blooming & so innocent, as if she had never had a wicked Thought in
her Life - which yet one has some reason to suppose she must have had,
if we believe the Doctrine of original Sin, or if we remember the events
of her girlish days.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.621

- I hope Lizzy will have her Play.  Very kindly arranged for her.
AUSTEN-181X-2,481.622

Henry is generally thought very good-looking, but not so handsome
as Edward.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.623

- I think <font> I <$$font> prefer his face.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.624

- Wm. is in excellent Looks, AUSTEN-181X-2,481.625

has a fine appetite AUSTEN-181X-2,481.626

& seems perfectly well.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.627

You will have a great Break-up at G=m= in the Spring,
AUSTEN-181X-2,481.628

You <font> must <$$font> feel their all going.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.629

It is very right however.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.630

One sees many good causes for it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.631

- Poor Miss C. - I shall pity her, when she begins to understand
herself.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.632

- Your objection to the Quadrilles delighted me exceedingly.
AUSTEN-181X-2,481.633

- Pretty well, for a Lady irrecoverably attached to <font> one <$$font>
Person!  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.634

- Sweet Fanny, beleive no such thing of yourself.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.635

- Spread no such malicious slander upon your Understanding, within the
Precincts of your Imagination.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.636

Do not speak ill of your Sense, merely for the Gratification of your
Fancy.  AUSTEN-181X-2,481.637

- Yours is Sense, which deserves more honourable Treatment.
AUSTEN-181X-2,481.638

- You are <font> not <$$font> <P_482> in love with him.

- Poor Mrs. C. Milles, that she should die on a wrong day
at last, after being about it so long!  AUSTEN-181X-2,483.657

- It was unlucky that the Goodnestone Party could not meet you,
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.658

& I hope her friendly, obliging, social Spirit, which delighted in drawing
People together, was not conscious of the division and disappointment
she was occasioning.  AUSTEN-181X-2,483.659

I am sorry & surprised that you speak of her as having little to leave,
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.660

& must feel for Miss Milles, though she <font> is <$$font> Molly
, if a material loss of Income is to attend her other loss.
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.661

- Single Women have a dreadful propensity for being poor - which is one
very strong argument in favour of Matrimony, AUSTEN-181X-2,483.662

but I need not dwell on such arguments with <font> you <$$font>, pretty
Dear, AUSTEN-181X-2,483.663

you do not want inclination.  AUSTEN-181X-2,483.664

- Well, I shall say, as I have often said before, Do not be in a hurry;
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.665

depend upon it, the right Man will come at last; AUSTEN-181X-2,483.666

you will in the course of the next two or three years, meet with somebody
more generally unexceptionable than anyone you have yet known, who
will love you as warmly as ever <font> He <$$font> did, and who will so
completely attach you, that you will feel you never really loved before.
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.667

- And then, by not beginning the business of Mothering quite so early in
life, you will be young in Constitution, spirits, figure & countenance
, while M=rs= W=m= Hammond is growing old by confinements & nursing.
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.668

Do none of the Plumtres ever come to Balls now?  AUSTEN-181X-2,483.669

- You have never mentioned them as being at any?  AUSTEN-181X-2,483.670

- And what do you hear of the Gipps or of Fanny and her Husband?
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.671

- M=rs= F. A. is to be confined the middle of April,
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.672

& is by no means remarkably Large for <font> her.  <$$font>
AUSTEN-181X-2,483.673

Aunt Cassandra walked <P_484> to Wyards yesterday with Mrs.
Digweed.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.674

Anna has had a bad cold, AUSTEN-181X-2,484.675

looks pale, AUSTEN-181X-2,484.676

& we fear something else.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.677

She has just weaned Julia.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.678

- How soon, the difference of temper in Children appears!
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.679

- Jemima has a very irritable bad Temper <paren> her Mother says
so <$$paren> - and Julia a very sweet one, always pleased & happy.
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.680

- I hope as Anna is so early sensible of it's {COM:sic} defects, that
she will give Jemima's disposition the early & steady attention it
must require.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.681

<font> I <$$font> have also heard lately from your Aunt Harriot,
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.682

& $can $not {TEXT:cannot} understand their plans in parting with Miss S-
whom she seems very much to value, now that Harriot & Eleanor are both of
an age for a Governess to be so useful to; especially as when Caroline was
sent to School some years, <font> Miss Bell <$$font> was still retained,
though the others were then mere Nursery Children.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.683

- They have some good reason I dare say, though I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
penetrate it, AUSTEN-181X-2,484.684

& till I know what it is I shall invent a bad one, and amuse myself with
accounting for the difference of measures by supposing Miss S.
to be a superior sort of Woman, who has never stooped to recommend
herself to the Master of the family by Flattery, as Miss Bell did.
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.685

I <font> will <$$font> answer your kind questions more than you expect.
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.686

Miss Catherine is put upon the Shelve for the present,
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.687

and I do not know that she will ever come out; AUSTEN-181X-2,484.688

but I have a something ready for Publication, which may perhaps appear
about a twelvemonth hence.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.689

It is short, about the length of Catherine.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.690

- This is for yourself alone.  AUSTEN-181X-2,484.691

Neither Mr. Salusbury nor Mr. Wildman are to know of it.
AUSTEN-181X-2,484.692

I am got tolerably well again, quite equal to walking about & enjoying
the Air; AUSTEN-181X-2,484.693

and by sitting down & resting a good while between my Walks, I get
exercise <P_485> enough.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.694

I have a scheme however for accomplishing more, as the weather grows
springlike.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.695

I mean to take to riding the Donkey.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.696

It will be more independant & less troublesome than the use of the
carriage, AUSTEN-181X-2,485.697

& I shall be able to go about with A=t= Cassandra in her walks to Alton
and Wyards.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.698

- I hope you will think Wm. looking well.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.699

He was bilious the other day, AUSTEN-181X-2,485.700

and Aunt Cass: supplied him with a Dose at his own request, which seemed
to have good effect.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.701

- I was sure <font> you <$$font> would have approved it.
AUSTEN-181X-2,485.702

Wm. & I are the best of friends.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.703

I love him very much.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.704

Everything is so <font> natural <$$font> about him, his affections,
his Manners & his Drollery.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.705

He entertains & interests us extremely.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.706

- Max: Hammond and A. M. Shaw are people whom I $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} care for, in themselves, AUSTEN-181X-2,485.707

but I enter into their situation AUSTEN-181X-2,485.708

& am glad they are so happy.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.709

If I were the Duchess of Richmond, I should be very miserable about my
son's choice.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.710

What can be expected from a Paget, born & brought up in the centre of
conjugal Infidelity & Divorces?  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.711

- I will <font> not <$$font> be interested about Lady Caroline.
AUSTEN-181X-2,485.712

I abhor all the race of Pagets.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.713

Our fears increase for poor little Harriet; AUSTEN-181X-2,485.714

the latest account is that Sir Ev: Home is confirmed in his opinion of
there being water on the brain.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.715

I hope Heaven in its mercy will take her soon.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.716

Her poor Father will be quite worn out by his feelings for her.
AUSTEN-181X-2,485.717

- He $can $not {TEXT:cannot} spare Cassy at present, AUSTEN-181X-2,485.718

she is an occupation & a comfort to him.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.719

Adieu my dearest Fanny.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.720

Nothing could be more delicious than your Letter; AUSTEN-181X-2,485.721

& the assurance of your feeling releived by writing it, made the pleasure
perfect.  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.722

- But how could it possibly be any new idea to you that you have a great
deal of Imagination?  AUSTEN-181X-2,485.723

- <P_486> You are all over Imagination.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.724

The most astonishing part of your Character is, that with so much
Imagination, so much flight of Mind, such unbounded Fancies, you should
have such excellent Judgement in what you do!  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.725

- Religious Principle I fancy must explain it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.726

Well, good-bye {TEXT:good_bye} AUSTEN-181X-2,486.727

& God bless you.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.728

{ED:142._To_Fanny_Knight._Sunday_23_March_[1817]}

{COM:editorial_material_omitted}

Chawton, AUSTEN-181X-2,486.733

Sunday March 23.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.734

I am very much obliged to you my dearest Fanny for sending me Mr.
Wildman's conversation, AUSTEN-181X-2,486.735

I had great amusement in reading it, AUSTEN-181X-2,486.736

& I <font> hope <$$font> I am not affronted & do not think the worse of
him for having a Brain so very different from mine, AUSTEN-181X-2,486.737

but my strongest sensation of all is <font> astonishment <$$font>
at your being able to press him on the subject so perseveringly -
AUSTEN-181X-2,486.738

and I agree with your Papa, that it was not fair.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.739

When he knows the truth he will be uncomfortable.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.740

- You are the oddest Creature!  - Nervous enough in some respects, but
in others perfectly without nerves!  - Quite unrepulsible, hardened &
impudent.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.741

Do not oblige him to read any more.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.742

- Have mercy on him, AUSTEN-181X-2,486.743

tell him the truth AUSTEN-181X-2,486.744

& make him an apology.  AUSTEN-181X-2,486.745

He & I should not in the least agree of course, in our ideas of Novels
and Heroines; AUSTEN-181X-2,486.746

pictures of perfection as you know make <P_487> me sick & wicked -
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.747

but there is some very good sense in what he says, AUSTEN-181X-2,487.748

& I particularly respect him for wishing to think well of all young
Ladies; AUSTEN-181X-2,487.749

it shews an amiable & a delicate Mind.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.750

- And he deserves better treatment than to be obliged to read any more
of my Works.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.751

- Do not be surprised at finding Uncle Henry acquainted with my having
another ready for publication.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.752

I could not say No when he asked me, AUSTEN-181X-2,487.753

but he knows nothing more of it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.754

- You will not like it, so you need not be impatient.
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.755

You may <font> perhaps <$$font> like the Heroine, as she is almost too
good for me.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.756

- Many thanks for your kind care for my health; AUSTEN-181X-2,487.757

I certainly have not been well for many weeks, AUSTEN-181X-2,487.758

and about a week ago I was very poorly, AUSTEN-181X-2,487.759

I have had a good deal of fever at times & indifferent nights,
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.760

but am considerably better now, & recovering my Looks a little,
which have been bad enough, black & white & every wrong colour.
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.761

I must not depend upon being ever very blooming again.
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.762

Sickness is a dangerous Indulgence at my time of Life.
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.763

Thank you for everything you tell me; AUSTEN-181X-2,487.764

- I do not feel worthy of it by anything I can say in return,
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.765

but I assure you my pleasure in your Letters is quite as great as ever, &
I am interested & amused just as you could wish me.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.766

If there is a <font> Miss <$$font> Marsden, I perceive whom she will
marry.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.767

<font> Even=g= <$$font>.  - AUSTEN-181X-2,487.768

I was languid & dull & very bad company when I wrote the above;
AUSTEN-181X-2,487.769

I am better now - to my own feelings at least - AUSTEN-181X-2,487.770

& wish I may be more agreable.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.771

- We are going to have Rain, & after that, very pleasant genial weather
, which will exactly do for me, as my Saddle will then be completed -
and air & exercise is what I want.  AUSTEN-181X-2,487.772

Indeed I shall be very glad when the <P_488> event at Scarlets is over,
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.773

the expectation of it keeps us in a worry, your Grandmama especially;
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.774

she sits brooding over Evils which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be remedied &
Conduct impossible to be understood.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.775

- Now, the reports from Keppel St. are rather better;
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.776

little Harriet's headaches are abated, AUSTEN-181X-2,488.777

& Sir Ev=d=: is satisfied with the effect of the Mercury,
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.778

& does not despair of a Cure.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.779

The Complaint I find is not considered incurable nowadays,
provided the Patient be young enough not to have the Head hardened.
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.780

The Water in that case may be drawn off by Mercury.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.781

But though this is a new idea to us, perhaps it may been long familiar
to you, through your friend Mr. Scud: AUSTEN-181X-2,488.782

- I hope his high renown is maintained by driving away William's cough.
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.783

Tell William that Triggs is as beautiful & condescending as ever, &
was so good as to dine with us today, AUSTEN-181X-2,488.784

& tell him that I often play at <font> Nines <$$font> and think of him.
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.785

- Anna has not a chance of escape; AUSTEN-181X-2,488.786

her husband called here the other day, AUSTEN-181X-2,488.787

& said she was <font> pretty <$$font> well but not <font> equal <$$font>
to so long a walk; AUSTEN-181X-2,488.788

she <font> must come in <$$font> her <font> Donkey Carriage.  <$$font>
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.789

- Poor Animal, she will be worn out before she is thirty.
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.790

- I am very sorry for her.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.791

M=rs= Clement too is in that way again.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.792

I am quite tired of so many Children.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.793

- M=rs= Benn has a 13=th=.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.794

- The Papillons came back on friday {COM:sic} night, AUSTEN-181X-2,488.795

but I have not seen them yet, as I do not venture to Church.
AUSTEN-181X-2,488.796

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hear however, but that they are the same
Mr. P. & his sister they used to be.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.797

She has engaged a new Maidservant in Mrs. Calker's room, whom
she means to make also Housekeeper under herself.  AUSTEN-181X-2,488.798

- Old Philmore was buried yesterday, AUSTEN-181X-2,488.799

& I, by way of saying something to Triggs, observed that it had been a
very handsome Funeral, AUSTEN-181X-2,488.800

but his <P_489> manner of reply made me suppose that it was not generally
esteemed so.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.801

I can only be sure of <font> one <$$font> part being very handsome,
Triggs himself, walking behind in his Green Coat.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.802

- Mrs. Philmore attended as chief Mourner, in Bombasin, made very
short, and flounced with Crape.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.803

<font> Tuesday.  <$$font> AUSTEN-181X-2,489.804

- I have had various plans as to this Letter, AUSTEN-181X-2,489.805

but at last I have determined that Un: Henry shall forward it to London.
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.806

I want to see how Canterbury looks in the direction.
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.807

- When once Unc. H. has left us I shall wish him with you.
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.808

London is become a hateful place to him, AUSTEN-181X-2,489.809

& he is always depresed by the idea of it.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.810

- I hope he will be in time for your sick.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.811

I am sure he must do that part of his Duty as excellently as all the rest.
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.812

He returned yesterday from Steventon, AUSTEN-181X-2,489.813

& was with us by breakfast, bringing Edward with him, only that Edw=d=
staid to breakfast at Wyards.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.814

We had a pleasant family-day, AUSTEN-181X-2,489.815

for the Altons dined with us; - the last visit of the kind probably,
which <font> she <$$font> will be able to pay us for many a month;
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.816

- Very well, to be able to do it so long, AUSTEN-181X-2,489.817

for she <font> expects <$$font> much about this day three weeks,
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.818

& is generally very exact.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.819

- I hope your own Henry is in France & that you have heard from him.
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.820

The Passage once over, he will feel all Happiness.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.821

- I took my 1=st= ride yesterday AUSTEN-181X-2,489.822

& liked it very much.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.823

I went up Mounters Lane, & round by where the new Cottages are to be,
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.824

& found the exercise & everything very pleasant, AUSTEN-181X-2,489.825

and I had the advantage of agreable companions, as A=t= Cass: and Edward
walked by my side.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.826

- A=t= Cass. is such an excellent Nurse, so assiduous & unwearied!
AUSTEN-181X-2,489.827

- But you know all that already.  AUSTEN-181X-2,489.828

- Very affec=ly= Yours J. Austen AUSTEN-181X-2,489.829
