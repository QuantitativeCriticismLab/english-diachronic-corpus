Act III.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.3

Scene I.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.4

<font> A Library at Lord <$$font> Norland <font>'s.  <$$font>
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.5

<font> Enter Lord <$$font> Norland, <font> followed, by Mr.
<$$font> Harmony.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.6

<font> Lord <$$font> Norland, <font> in anger.  <$$font> <$$heading>
I tell you, Mr. Harmony, that if an indifferent person, one on
whom I had never bestowed a favour in my life, were to offend me, it is
in my nature never to forgive.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.7

Can I then forgive my own daughter, my only child, on whom I heaped
continually marks of the most affectionate fondness?  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.8

Shall she dare to offend me in the tenderest point, and you dare to
suppose I will pardon her?  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.9

<font> Har. <$$font> Your child, consider.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.10

<font> Lord N. <$$font> The weakest argument you can use.
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.11

- As my child, was not she most bound to obey me?  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.12

As my child, ought she not to have sacrificed her own happiness to mine?
Instead of which, mine has been yielded up for a whim, a fancy, a fancy
to marry a beggar; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.13

and as such is her choice, let her beg with him.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.14

<font> Har. <$$font> She does by me; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.15

- pleads hard for your $forgiveness.  {TEXT:forgivenness}
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.16

<font> Lord N. <$$font> If I thought she dared to send a message
to me, though dictated on her knees, she should find that she had not
yet felt the full force of my resentment.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.17

<font> Har. <$$font> What could you do more?  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.18

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I have done nothing yet.
INCHBALD-1793-2,29.19

At present, I have only abandoned her; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.20

- but I can persecute.  INCHBALD-1793-2,29.21

<font> Har. <$$font> I have no doubt of it: INCHBALD-1793-2,29.22

and, that I may not be the means of aggravating your displeasure, I
assure you, that what I have now said has been entirely from myself,
without any desire of hers; INCHBALD-1793-2,29.23

and, <P_30> at the same time, I give you my promise, I will never presume
to intrude the subject again.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.24

<font> Lord N. <$$font> On this condition, <paren> but on no other,
<$$paren> I forgive you now.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.25

<font> Har. <$$font> And now then, my Lord, let us pass
from those who have forfeited your love, to those who possess it.
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.26

- I heard some time ago, but I never presumed to mention it to you,
that you had adopted a young man as your son?  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.27

<font> Lord N <$$font>"A young man! "INCHBALD-1793-2,30.28

Pshaw!  - No; a boy - a mere child, who fell in my way by accident.
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.29

<font> Har. <$$font> A chance child!  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.30

Ho!  ho!  - I understand you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.31

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Do not jest with me, Sir.
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.32

Do I look - INCHBALD-1793-2,30.33

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes, you look as if you would be ashamed to
own it, if you had one.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.34

<font> Lord N. <$$font> But this boy I am not ashamed of:
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.35

- he is a favourite - rather a favourite.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.36

- I did not like him so well at first; INCHBALD-1793-2,30.37

- but custom, - and having a poor creature entirely at one's mercy,
one begins to love it merely from the idea of - What would be its fate
if one did not?  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.38

<font> Har. <$$font> Is he an orphan then?  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.39

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.40

<font> Har. <$$font> You have a friendship for his parents?
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.41

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I never saw the father:
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.42

his mother I had a friendship for once.  <paren> <font> Sighing.  <$$font>
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.43

<font> Har. <$$font> Ay, while the husband was away?
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.44

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I tell you, no.  <font> <paren> <font>
violently.  <$$font> <$$paren> - INCHBALD-1793-2,30.45

But ask no more questions.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.46

Who his parents are, is a secret, which neither he, nor any one <paren>
that is now living <$$paren> knows, except myself; nor ever shall.
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.47

<font> Har. <$$font> Well, my Lord, since $'t $is {TEXT:'tis}
your pleasure to consider him as your child, I sincerely wish you may
experience more duty from him than you have done from your daughter.
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.48

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Thank Heaven, his disposition is not in
the least like her's.  INCHBALD-1793-2,30.49

- No: <paren> <font> very much impassioned.  <$$font> <$$paren>
I have the joy to say, that never child was so unlike its mother.
INCHBALD-1793-2,30.50

<P_31>

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> starting.  <$$font> <$$paren>
How!  His mother!  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.52

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Confusion!  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.53

- what have I said?  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.54

I am ashamed - INCHBALD-1793-2,31.55

<font> Har. <$$font> No, - be proud.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.56

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Of what?  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.57

<font> Har. <$$font> That you have a lawful heir to all your
riches; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.58

proud that you have a grandson.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.59

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I would have concealed it from all the
world; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.60

I wished it even unknown to myself.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.61

And let me tell you, Sir, <paren> as not by my design, but through my
inadvertency, you are become acquainted with this secret, <$$paren>
that, if ever you breathe it to a single creature, the boy shall answer
for it; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.62

for, were he known to be her's, though he were dearer to me than ever
<font> she <$$font> was, I would turn him from my house, and cast him
from my heart, as I have done her.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.63

<font> Har. <$$font> I believe you; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.64

- and in compassion to the child, give you my <font> solemn promise
<$$font> never to reveal who he is.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.65

I have heard that those unfortunate parents left an infant behind
when they went abroad, and that they now lament him as lost.
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.66

Will you satisfy my curiosity, in what manner you sought and found
him out?  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.67

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Do you suppose I searched for him?
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.68

No; he was forced upon me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.69

A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to my
country seat, with a half-starved boy in her hand, INCHBALD-1793-2,31.70

and asked my charity for my grand-child: INCHBALD-1793-2,31.71

the impression of the word, made me turn round involuntarily;
INCHBALD-1793-2,31.72

and casting my eyes, upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of
his mother's in all his face; INCHBALD-1793-2,31.73

and I began to feel something like pity for him.  INCHBALD-1793-2,31.74

In short, he caught such fast hold by one of my fingers, that I asked him
carelessly"if he would go home and live with me? "On which, he answered
me so willingly"Yes,"I took him at his word, INCHBALD-1793-2,31.75

<P_32>

<font> Har. <$$font> And did never your regard for him, plead on
his mother's behalf?  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.77

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Never.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.78

For, by Heaven.  I would as soon forgive the robber who met me last night
at my own door, and, holding a pistol to my breast, took from me a sum
to a considerable amount, as I would pardon her.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.79

<font> Har. <$$font> Did such an accident happen to you?
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.80

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Have you not heard of it?
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.81

<font> Har. <$$font> No.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.82

<font> Lord N. <$$font> It is amazing we $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
put a stop to such depredations.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.83

<font> Har. <$$font> Provisions are so scarce!
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.84

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.85

<font> Ser. <$$font> Miss Wooburn, my Lord, if you are not engaged,
will come and sit an hour with you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.86

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I have no company but what she is perfectly
acquainted with, INCHBALD-1793-2,32.87

and shall be glad of her visit.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.88

<font> Exit Servant, <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,32.89

<font> Har. <$$font> You forget I am a stranger, and my presence
may not be welcome.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.90

<font> Lord N. <$$font> A stranger!  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.91

What to my ward?  to Lady Ramble?  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.92

for that is the name which custom would authorise her to keep;
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.93

but such courtesy she disdains, in contempt of the unworthy giver of
the title.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.94

<font> Har. <$$font> I am intimate with Sir Robert, my Lord;
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.95

and though I acknowledge that both you and his lady have cause for
complaint, yet Sir Robert has still many virtues.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.96

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Not one.  INCHBALD-1793-2,32.97

He is the most vile, the most detestable of characters.
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.98

He not only contradicted my will in the whole of his conduct,
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.99

but he seldom met me that he did not give me some personal affront.
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.100

<font> Har. <$$font> It is, however, generally held
better to be uncivil in a person's presence, than in his absence.
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.101

<font> Lord N. <$$font> He was uncivil to me in every respect.
INCHBALD-1793-2,32.102

<P_33>

<font> Har. <$$font> That I will deny; INCHBALD-1793-2,33.104

for I have heard Sir Robert, in your absence, say such things in your
praise!  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.105

- <font> Lord N. <$$font> Indeed!  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.106

<font> Har. <$$font> Most assuredly.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.107

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I wish he had sometimes done me the honour
to have spoken politely to my face.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.108

<font> Har. <$$font> That is not Sir Robert's way;
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.109

- he is no flatterer.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.110

But then, no sooner has your back been turned {TEXT:tarned}, than I have
heard him lavish in your praise.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.111

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I must own, Mr Harmony, that I never
looked upon Sir Robert as incorrigible.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.112

I could always discern a ray of understanding and a beam of virtue
through all his foibles; INCHBALD-1793-2,33.113

nor would I have urged the divorce, but that I found his wife's,
sensibility could not bear his neglect; INCHBALD-1793-2,33.114

and even now, notwithstanding her endeavour to conceal it, she pines in
secret, INCHBALD-1793-2,33.115

and laments her hard fortune.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.116

All my hopes of restoring her health rest on one prospect - that of
finding a man worthy of my recommendation for her second husband, and,
by creating a second passion, expel the first.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.117

- Mr Harmony, you and I have been long acquainted.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.118

- I have known your disposition from your infancy.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.119

- Now, if such a man as you were to offer - INCHBALD-1793-2,33.120

<font> Har. <$$font> You flatter me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.121

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I do not.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.122

- Would you venture to become her husband?  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.123

<font> Har. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say I have any
particular desire, INCHBALD-1793-2,33.124

but if it will oblige either you or her, - for my part I think the short
time we live in this world, we should do all we can to oblige each other.
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.125

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I should rejoice at such an union myself
, INCHBALD-1793-2,33.126

and I think I can answer for her.  INCHBALD-1793-2,33.127

- You permit me then to make overtures to her in your name?
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.128

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> considering.
<$$paren> <$$font> This is rather a serious piece of business -
INCHBALD-1793-2,33.129

However, I never did make a difficulty <P_34> when I wished to oblige
a friend.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.130

- But there is one proviso, my Lord; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.131

I must first mention it to Sir Robert.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.132

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Why so?  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.133

<font> Har. <$$font> Because he and I have always been very
intimate friends; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.134

and to marry his wife without telling him of it, will appear very uncivil!
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.135

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Do you mean then to ask his consent?
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.136

<font> Har. <$$font> Not absolutely his consent;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.137

but I will insinuate the subject to him, and obtain his approbation in
a manner suitable to my own satisfaction.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.138

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You will oblige me then if you will see
him as early as possible; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.139

for it is reported he is going abroad.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.140

<font> Har. <$$font> I will go to him immediately;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.141

and, my Lord, I will do all in my power to oblige you, Sir Robert and
the Lady; INCHBALD-1793-2,34.142

<font> <paren> aside.  <$$paren> <$$font> - but as to obliging myself,
that was never one of my considerations.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.143

<paren> <font> Exit.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,34.144

<font> Enter Miss Wooburn.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,34.145

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I am sorry to see you thus;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.146

you have been weeping?  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.147

Will you still lament your separation from a cruel husband; as if you
had followed a kind one to the grave?  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.148

<font> Miss W. <$$font> By no means, my Lord.
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.149

Tears from our sex are not always the result of grief;
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.150

they are frequently no more than little sympathetic tributes which we pay
to our fellow-beings, while the mind and the heart are steeled against
the weakness which our eyes indicate.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.151

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Can you say, your mind and heart are
so steeled?  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.152

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I can: INCHBALD-1793-2,34.153

My mind is as firmly fixed against Sir Robert Ramble, as, at our first
acquaintance, it was fixed upon him.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.154

And I solemnly protest - INCHBALD-1793-2,34.155

<font> Lord N. <$$font> To a man of my age and observation,
protestations are vain.  INCHBALD-1793-2,34.156

- Give me a proof that you have rooted him from your heart.
INCHBALD-1793-2,34.157

<P_35>

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Any proof you require, I will give without
a moment's hesitation.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.159

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I take you at your word;
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.160

and desire you to accept a Gentleman, whom I shall recommend for your
second husband.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.161

<paren> <font> Miss <$$font> Wooburn <font> starts.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.162

- You said you would not hesitate a moment.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.163

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I thought I should not;
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.164

but this is something so unexpected - INCHBALD-1793-2,35.165

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You break your word then,
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.166

and still give cause for this ungrateful man, to ridicule your fondness
for him.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.167

<font> Miss W. <$$font> No, I will put an end to that humiliation
; INCHBALD-1793-2,35.168

and whoever the $gentleman {TEXT:gentelman} is whom you mean to propose
- INCHBALD-1793-2,35.169

Yet, do not name him at present - INCHBALD-1793-2,35.170

but give me the satisfaction of keeping the promise I have made to you
<paren> at least for a little time <$$paren> without exactly knowing
how far it extends; INCHBALD-1793-2,35.171

for, in return, I have a promise to ask from you, before I acquaint you
with the nature of your engagement.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.172

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I give my promise.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.173

Now name your request.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.174

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Then, my Lord, <font> hesitating and
confused <$$font> <$$paren> - the law gave me back, upon my divorce
from Sir Robert, the very large fortune which I brought to him.
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.175

- I am afraid, that in his present circumstances, to enforce
the strict payment of this debt, would very much embarrass him.
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.176

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What if it did?  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.177

<font> Miss W. <$$font> It is my entreaty to you <paren> in
whose hands is invested the power to demand this right of law <$$paren>
to lay my claim aside for the present.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.178

<paren> <font> Lord <$$font> Norland <font> offers to speak
<$$font> <$$paren> I know, my Lord, what you are going to say;
INCHBALD-1793-2,35.179

I know Sir Robert is not <font> now, <$$font> but I can never forget
that he <font> has been <$$font> my husband.  INCHBALD-1793-2,35.180

<font> Lord N. <$$font> To shew my gratitude for your complaince
with the request I have just made you, <paren> <font> Goes to a table
in the library <$$font> <$$paren> here is the bond by which I am <P_36>
impowered to seize on the $greatest {TEXT:greaest} part of his estates
in right of you: INCHBALD-1793-2,36.181

take the bond into your own possession till your next husband demands
it of you; INCHBALD-1793-2,36.182

and by the time you have called him husband for a few weeks,
this tenderness, or delicacy to Sir Robert, will be worn away.
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.183

<font> Enter <$$font> Harmony <paren> <font> hastily.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.184

<font> Har. <$$font> My Lord, I beg pardon; INCHBALD-1793-2,36.185

- but I forgot to mention - INCHBALD-1793-2,36.186

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Oh, Mr Harmony, I have not seen you before
I know not when: INCHBALD-1793-2,36.187

I am particularly happy at your calling just now, INCHBALD-1793-2,36.188

for I have - <paren> <font> hesitating <$$font> <$$paren> a little favour
to ask of you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.189

<font> Har. <$$font> If it were a great favour, Madam, you might
command me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.190

<font> Miss W. <$$font> But - my Lord, I beg your pardon.
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.191

- but the favour I have to ask of Mr Harmony must be told to him in
private.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.192

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Oh, I am sure, I have not the
least objection to you and Mr Harmony having a private conference.
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.193

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} leave you together.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.194

<paren> Harmony <font> appears embarrassed.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.195

You do not derange my business - INCHBALD-1793-2,36.196

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be back in a short time.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.197

<paren> <font> Exit.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,36.198

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Mr Harmony, you are the very man on earth
I most wanted to see.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.199

<paren> Harmony <font> bows.  <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,36.200

I know the kindness of your heart, the liberality of your sentiments,
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.201

and I wish to repose a charge to your trust, very near to me indeed -
INCHBALD-1793-2,36.202

but you must be secret.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.203

<font> Har. <$$font> When a Lady reposes a trust in me, I should
not be a man if I were not.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.204

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I must first inform you, that Lord Norland
has just drawn from me a promise, that I will once more enter into the
marriage-state; INCHBALD-1793-2,36.205

and without knowing to whom he intends to give me, I will keep my promise
- INCHBALD-1793-2,36.206

But it is in vain to say, that though I mean all duty and fidelity to
my second husband, I shall not experience moments when my thoughts -
will wander on my first.  INCHBALD-1793-2,36.207

<P_37>

<font> Har. <paren> starting.  <$$paren> <$$font> Hem - Hem!
- <paren> <font> To her <$$font> - indeed?  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.209

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I must always rejoice in Sir Robert's
successes, and lament over his misfortunes.  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.210

<font> Har. <$$font> If that is all - INCHBALD-1793-2,37.211

<font> Miss W. <$$font> No, I would go one step further:
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.212

<paren> Harmony <font> starts again <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.213

I would secure him from those misfortunes, which to hear of, will disturb
my peace of mind.  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.214

I know his fortune has suffered very much, INCHBALD-1793-2,37.215

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}, <font> will not, <$$font> place it in the
power of the man, whom my Lord Norland may point out for my next marriage,
to distress him farther.  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.216

- This is the writing, by which that Gentleman may claim the part
of my fortune from Sir Robert Ramble, which is in landed property;
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.217

carry it, my dear Mr Harmony, to Sir Robert instantly;
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.218

and tell him, that in separating from him, I meant only to give him
liberty; not make him the debtor, perhaps the prisoner of my future
husband.  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.219

<font> Har. <$$font> Madam, I will most undoubtedly take this
bond to my friend; INCHBALD-1793-2,37.220

but will you give me leave to suggest to you, that the person on whom
you bestow your hand, may be a little surprised to find, that while he
is in possession of you, Sir Robert is in the possession of your fortune?
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.221

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Do not imagine, Sir, that I shall marry
any man, $without {TEXT:witout} first declaring what I have done -
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.222

I only wish at present it should be concealed from Lord Norland -
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.223

When this paper is given, as I have required, it $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be recalled; INCHBALD-1793-2,37.224

and when that is past, I shall divulge my conduct to whom I please
; and first of all, to him, who shall offer me his addresses.
INCHBALD-1793-2,37.225

<font> Har. <$$font> And if he is a man of my feelings, his
addresses will be doubly importunate for this proof of liberality to
your former husband.  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.226

- But are you sure, that in the return of this bond, there is no secret
affection, no latent spark of love?  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.227

<font> Miss W. <$$font> None.  INCHBALD-1793-2,37.228

I know my heart: INCHBALD-1793-2,37.229

and if there <P_38> was, I could not ask you, Mr Harmony <paren> nor
any one like you <$$paren>, to be the messenger of an imprudent passion.
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.230

Sir Robert's vanity, I know, may cause him to judge otherwise;
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.231

but undeceive him; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.232

let him know this is a sacrifice to the golden principles of duty, and
not an offering to the tinselled shrine of love.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.233

<font> Enter Lord <$$font> Norland.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.234

Put up the bond.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.235

- <paren> Harmony <font> conceals it.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.236

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Well, my dear, have you made your request.
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.237

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Yes, my Lord.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.238

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And has he granted it?
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.239

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes, my Lord, I am going to grant it.
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.240

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I sincerely wish you both joy of this
good understanding between you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.241

But, Mr Harmony, <paren> <font> in a whisper <$$font> <$$paren> are not
you going to Sir Robert?  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.242

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes, my Lord, I am going this moment
{COM:sic_no_punctuation} INCHBALD-1793-2,38.243

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Make haste then, INCHBALD-1793-2,38.244

and do not forget your errand.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.245

<font> Har. <$$font> No, my Lord, I $sha $n't {TEXT:sha'n't}
forget my errand; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.246

it $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} slip my memory - INCHBALD-1793-2,38.247

Good morning, my Lord - INCHBALD-1793-2,38.248

good morning, Madam.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.249

<font> Exit.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,38.250

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Now, my dear, as you and Mr Harmony seem
to be on such excellent terms, I think I may venture to tell you <paren>
if he has not yet told you himself, <$$paren> that he is the man who is
to be your husband.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.251

<font> Miss W. <$$font> He!  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.252

Mr Harmony!  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.253

- No, my Lord, he has not told me; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.254

and I am confident he never will.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.255

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What makes you think so?
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.256

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Because - because - he must be sensible
he would not be the man I should choose.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.257

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And where is the woman who marries?
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.258

the man she would choose?  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.259

You are reverting the order of society; INCHBALD-1793-2,38.260

men, only, have the right of choice in marriage.  INCHBALD-1793-2,38.261

Were women permitted theirs, we should have handsome beggars allied to our
noblest families, and no such object in our whole island as an old maid.
INCHBALD-1793-2,38.262

<P_39>

<font> Miss W. <$$font> But being denied that choice, why forbid
to remain as I am?  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.264

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What are you now?  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.265

Neither a widow, a maid, nor a wife.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.266

If I could fix a term to your present state, I should not be thus anxious
to place you in another.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.267

<font> Miss W. <$$font> I am perfectly acquainted with your
friendly motives, INCHBALD-1793-2,39.268

and feel the full force of your advice.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.269

- I therefore renew my promise INCHBALD-1793-2,39.270

and although Mr Harmony <paren> in respect to the marriage state <$$paren>
is as little to my wishes as any man on earth, I will nevertheless
endeavour - whatever struggles it may cost me - to be to him, if he
prefers his suit, a dutiful, an obedient - INCHBALD-1793-2,39.271

but, for a loving wife, that I can never be again, INCHBALD-1793-2,39.272

<paren> <font> Exeunt severally.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,39.273

<heading>

Scene.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.275

<font> An Apartment at Sir <$$font> Robert Ramble <font>'s.  <$$font>
<$$heading> INCHBALD-1793-2,39.276

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Robert <font> and Mr <$$font> Harmony.
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.277

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I thank you for this visit.
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.278

I was undetermined what to do with myself.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.279

Your company has determined me to stay at home.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.280

<font> Har. <$$font> I was with a gentleman just now, Sir Robert
, INCHBALD-1793-2,39.281

and you were the subject of our conversation, INCHBALD-1793-2,39.282

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Had it been a Lady, I should be anxious
to know what she said.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.283

<font> Har. <$$font> I have been with a Lady likewise;
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.284

and she made you the subject of her discourse.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.285

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But was she handsome?
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.286

<font> Har. <$$font> Very handsome.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.287

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My dear fellow, what is her name?
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.288

What did she say, INCHBALD-1793-2,39.289

and where may I meet with her?  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.290

<font> Har. <$$font> Her name is Wooburn.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.291

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That is the name of my late wife.
INCHBALD-1793-2,39.292

<font> Har. <$$font> It is her I mean.  INCHBALD-1793-2,39.293

<P_40>

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Zounds, you had just put my spirits into
a flame, INCHBALD-1793-2,40.295

and now you throw cold water all over me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.296

<font> Har. <$$font> I am sorry to hear you say so,
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.297

for I came from her this moment; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.298

and what do you think is the present she has given me to deliver to you?
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.299

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Pshaw!  I want no presents.
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.300

Some of my old love-letters returned, I suppose, to remind me of my
inconstancy!  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.301

<font> Har. <$$font> Do not undervalue her generosity:
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.302

this is her present; - this bond, which has power to take from you three
thousand a year, her right.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.303

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Ah!  this is a present indeed.
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.304

Are you sure you speak truth?  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.305

Let me look at it: INCHBALD-1793-2,40.306

- Sure my eyes deceive me!  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.307

- No, by heaven it is true!  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.308

<paren> <font> Reads.  <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,40.309

The very thing I wanted, and will make me perfectly happy.
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.310

Now $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be generous again; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.311

my bills shall be paid, my gaming debts cancelled, INCHBALD-1793-2,40.312

poor Irwin shall find a friend; INCHBALD-1793-2,40.313

and $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} send her as pretty a copy of verses as ever I
wrote in my life.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.314

<font> Har. <$$font> Take care how you treat with levity a woman
of her elevated mind.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.315

She charged me to assure you,"that love has no share whatever in this
act, but merely compassion to the embarrassed state of your affairs.
"INCHBALD-1793-2,40.316

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Sir, I would have you to know, I am no
object of compassion.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.317

However, a Lady's favour one $can $not {TEXT:cannot} return;
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.318

and so, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} keep this thing.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.319

<paren> <font> Puts it in his pocket, <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,40.320

<font> Har. <$$font> Nay, if your circumstances are different
from what she imagines, give it me back, and I will return it to her.
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.321

<font> Sir R. <$$font> No, poor thing!  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.322

it would break her heart to send it back.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.323

- No $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} keep it.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.324

- She would never forgive me, were I to send it back.
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.325

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} keep it.  INCHBALD-1793-2,40.326

And she is welcome to attribute her concern for me to what she pleases.
INCHBALD-1793-2,40.327

But surely you can see - INCHBALD-1793-2,40.328

you understand - INCHBALD-1793-2,40.329

But Heaven bless <P_41> her for her love!  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.330

and I would love her in return - if I could.  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.331

<font> Har. <$$font> You would not talk thus, if you had seen the
firm dignity with which she gave me that paper - INCHBALD-1793-2,41.332

Assure him,"said she,"no remaining affection comes along with it,
but merely a duty which I owe to him, to protect him from the
humiliation of being a debtor to the man whom I am going to marry.
"INCHBALD-1793-2,41.333

<font> Sir R. <$$font> <paren> <font> with the utmost emotion
, <$$font> <$$paren> Why, she is not going to be married again!
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.334

<font> Har. <$$font> I believe, so.  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.335

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But are you sure of it, Sir?
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.336

Are you sure of it?  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.337

<font> Har. <$$font> Both she and her guardian told me so.
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.338

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That guardian, my Lord $Norland
{TEXT:Noreland}, is one of the basest, vilest of men.
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.339

- I tell you what, Sir, INCHBALD-1793-2,41.340

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} resent this usage.  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.341

<font> Har. <$$font> Wherefore?  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.342

- As to his being the means of bringing about your separation, in that
he obliged you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.343

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes, Sir, he did, INCHBALD-1793-2,41.344

he certainly did; INCHBALD-1793-2,41.345

- but though I am not the least offended with him on that head, <paren>
for at that I rejoice, <$$paren> yet I will resent his disposing of her
a second time.  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.346

<font> Har. <$$font> And why?  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.347

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Because, little regard as I have for her
myself, yet no other man shall dare to treat her so ill, as I have done.
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.348

<font> Har. <$$font> Do not fear it - INCHBALD-1793-2,41.349

Her next husband will be a man, who, I can safely say, will never
insult, or even offend her; but sooth, indulge, and make her happy.
INCHBALD-1793-2,41.350

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And do you dare to tell me, that her next
husband will make her happy?  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.351

Now that is worse than the other - INCHBALD-1793-2,41.352

No, Sir, no man shall ever have it to say"he has made her either happy
or miserable,"but myself.  INCHBALD-1793-2,41.353

<P_42>

<font> Har. <$$font> I know of but one way to prevent it.
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.355

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And what is that?  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.356

<font> Har. <$$font> Pay your addresses to her,
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.357

and marry her again yourself.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.358

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And I would, rather than she should be
happy with any body else.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.359

The devil take me if I would not.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.360

<font> Har. <$$font> To shew that I am wholly disinterested in
this affair, I will carry her a letter from you, if you like, and say
all I can in your behalf.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.361

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.362

Now, my dear Harmony, you carry your good-natured simplicity too far.
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.363

However, I thank you, INCHBALD-1793-2,42.364

I sincerely thank you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.365

- But do you imagine I should be such a blockhead, as to make love to
that same woman I made love to seven years ago, and who for the last
six years I totally neglected?  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.366

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes: for if you neglected her six years,
she will now be a novelty.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.367

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Egad, and so she will.
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.368

You are right.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.369

<font> Har. <$$font> But being in possession of her fortune,
you can be very happy without her.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.370

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Take her fortune back, Sir <paren> <font>
Taking the bond from his pocket, and offering it to <$$font> Harmony.
<$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,42.371

I would starve, INCHBALD-1793-2,42.372

I would perish, die in poverty and infamy, rather than owe an obligation
to a vile, perfidious, inconstant woman.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.373

<font> Har. <$$font> Consider, Sir Robert, if you insist
on my taking this bond back, it may fall into the husband's hands.
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.374

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Take it back - INCHBALD-1793-2,42.375

I insist upon it INCHBALD-1793-2,42.376

<paren> <font> Gives it him, INCHBALD-1793-2,42.377

and <$$font> Harmony <font> puts it up.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.378

But, Mr Harmony, depend on it, Lord Norland shall hear from me, in the
most serious manner, for his interference.  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.379

I repeat, he is the vilest, the most villanous of men.
INCHBALD-1793-2,42.380

<font> Har. <$$font> How can you speak with such rancour of a
nobleman, who speaks of you in the highest terms?  INCHBALD-1793-2,42.381

<P_43>

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Does he,'faith?  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.383

<font> Har. <$$font> He owns you have some faults.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.384

<font> Sir <$$font> R. I know I have.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.385

<font> Har. <$$font> But he thinks your good qualities are
numberless.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.386

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Now dam'me, if ever I thought so ill of
<font> him, <$$font> as I have appeared to do!  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.387

- But who is the intended husband, my dear friend?  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.388

Tell me, that I may laugh at him, and make you laugh at him.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.389

<font> Har. <$$font> No, I am not inclined to laugh at him.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.390

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Is it old Solus; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.391

<font> Har. <$$font> No.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.392

<font> Sir <$$font> R. But I will bet you a wager it is somebody
equally ridiculous.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.393

<font> Har. <$$font> I never bet.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.394

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Solus is mad for a wife,
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.395

and has been praising mine up to the heavens; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.396

you need say no more; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.397

I know it is he.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.398

<font> Har. <$$font> Upon my honour, it is not.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.399

However I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} disclose to you at present the person's
name; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.400

I must first obtain Lord Norland's permission.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.401

<font> Sir <$$font> R. I shall ask you no more.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.402

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} write to her - INCHBALD-1793-2,43.403

she will tell me; INCHBALD-1793-2,43.404

- or, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} pay her a visit, and ask her boldly myself.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.405

- Do you think <paren> <font> anxiously <$$font> <$$paren> - do you
think she would see me?  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.406

<font> Har. <$$font> You can but try.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.407

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.408

<font> Ser. <$$font> Mr Solus.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.409

<font> Sir <$$font> R. Now I find out the secret immediately.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.410

- $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} charge him with being the intended husband.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.411

<font> Har. <$$font> I will not stay to hear you.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.412

<font> Enter <$$font> Solus.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.413

Mr. Solus, how do you do?  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.414

I am extremely sorry that my engagements take me away as soon as you
enter.  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.415

<paren> <font> Exit <$$font> Har. <font> running, to avoid an
explanation.  <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,43.416

<font> Sol. <$$font> Sir Robert, what is the matter?
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.417

Has any thing ruffled you?  INCHBALD-1793-2,43.418

Why, I never saw you look more out of temper, even while you were married.
INCHBALD-1793-2,43.419

<P_44>

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Ah!  that I had never married!  never known
what marriage was!  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.421

for, even at this moment, I feel its torments in my heart.
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.422

<font> Sol. <$$font> I have often heard of the torments of
matrimony; INCHBALD-1793-2,44.423

but I conceive, that at the worst, they are nothing more than a
kind of violent tickling, which will force the tears into your eyes,
though at the same time you are bursting your sides with laughter.
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.424

<font> Sir R. <$$font> You have defined marriage too favourably;
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.425

there is no laughter in the state: INCHBALD-1793-2,44.426

all is melancholy, all gloom.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.427

<font> Sol. <$$font> Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy
for the spleen.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.428

I have known a gentleman at a feast receive an affront, disguise his
rage , step home, vent it all upon his wife, return to his companions,
and be as good company as if nothing had happened.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.429

.  <font> Sir R. <$$font> But even the necessary expences of a
wife should alarm you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.430

<font> Sol. <$$font> I can then retrench some of my own.
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.431

Oh!  my dear Sir, a married man has so many delightful privileges to
what a bachelor has!  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.432

- An old lady will introduce her daughters to you in a dishabille -
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.433

"It does not signify, my dears, INCHBALD-1793-2,44.434

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} a married man"- INCHBALD-1793-2,44.435

One lady will suffer you to draw on her glove - INCHBALD-1793-2,44.436

"Never mind, INCHBALD-1793-2,44.437

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} a married man"- INCHBALD-1793-2,44.438

Another will permit you to pull on her slipper; INCHBALD-1793-2,44.439

a third will even take you into her bed-chamber - INCHBALD-1793-2,44.440

"Pshaw, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} <font> nothing <$$font> but a married man.
"INCHBALD-1793-2,44.441

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But the weight of your fetters will
overbalance all these joys.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.442

<font> Sol. <$$font> And I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say,
notwithstanding you are relieved from the bond, that I see much joy or
brightness here.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.443

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I am not very well at present;
INCHBALD-1793-2,44.444

I have the head-ach; INCHBALD-1793-2,44.445

and, if ever a wife can be of comfort to her husband, it must be when
he is indisposed.  INCHBALD-1793-2,44.446

A <P_45> wife, then, binds up your head, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.447

mixes your powders, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.448

bathes your temples, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.449

and hovers about, in a way that is most endearing.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.450

<font> Sol. <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} speak of it;
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.451

I long to have one hover about me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.452

But I will - INCHBALD-1793-2,45.453

I am determined I will, before I am a week older.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.454

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} speak, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.455

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} attempt to persuade me not.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.456

Your description has renewed my eagerness - INCHBALD-1793-2,45.457

I will be married.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.458

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And without pretending not to know who
you mean to make your wife, I tell you plainly, it is, Miss Wooburn, -
it is my late wife.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.459

- I know you have made overtures to my Lord Norland, and that he has
given his consent.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.460

<font> Sol. <$$font> You tell me a great piece of news -
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.461

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go ask my Lord if it be true; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.462

and if he says it is, I shall be very glad to find it so.
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.463

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That is right, Sir; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.464

marry her, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.465

marry her; INCHBALD-1793-2,45.466

I give you joy, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.467

- $that $'s {TEXT:that's} all.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.468

- Ha, ha, ha!  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.469

I think I should know her temper - INCHBALD-1793-2,45.470

But if you will venture to marry her, I sincerely wish you happy.
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.471

<font> Sol. <$$font> And if we are not, you know we can be
divorced.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.472

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Not always.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.473

Take my advice, INCHBALD-1793-2,45.474

and live as you are.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.475

<font> Sol. <$$font> You almost stagger my resolution -
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.476

I had painted such bright prospects of marriage: INCHBALD-1793-2,45.477

Good day to you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.478

<paren> <font> going, returns.  <$$font> <$$paren> - You think I had
better not marry?  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.479

<font> Sir R. <$$font> You are undone if you do.
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.480

<font> Sol. <paren> sighing.  <$$font> <$$paren> <font> You
<$$font> ought to know from experience.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.481

<font> Sir R. <$$font> From that I speak.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.482

<font> Sol. <$$font> <paren> <font> Going to the door, and
returning once or twice, as unstable in his resolution.  <$$font>
<$$paren> But then what a poor disconsolate object shall I live, without
a wife to hover about me; to bind up my head, and bathe my temples!
INCHBALD-1793-2,45.483

Oh!  I am impatient for all the chartered rights, privileges, and
immunities of a married man.  INCHBALD-1793-2,45.484

<paren> <font> Exit.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,45.485

<P_46>

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Furies, racks, torments -
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.487

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear what I feel, INCHBALD-1793-2,46.488

and yet I am ashamed to own I feel any thing!  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.489

<font> Enter Mr <$$font> Placid.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.490

<font> Pla. <$$font> My dear Sir Robert, give me joy.
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.491

Mrs Placid and I are come to the very point you advised;
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.492

matters are in the fairest way for a separation.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.493

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I do give you joy, and most sincerely.
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.494

- You are right; INCHBALD-1793-2,46.495

$you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} soon be as happy as I am, <paren> <font> sighing.
<$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,46.496

But would you suppose it?  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.497

that deluded woman, my wife, is going to be married again!
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.498

I thought she had enough of me!  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.499

<font> Pla. <$$font> You are hurt, I see, lest the world should
say she has forgot you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.500

<font> Sir R. <$$font> She $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forget me;
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.501

I defy her to forget me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.502

<font> Pla. <$$font> Who is her intended husband?
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.503

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Solus, Solus.  An old man - an ugly man ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.504

He left me this moment, INCHBALD-1793-2,46.505

and owned it - owned it!  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.506

Go after him, will you, INCHBALD-1793-2,46.507

and persuade him not to have her.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.508

<font> Pla. <$$font> My advice will have no effect,
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.509

for you know he is bent upon matrimony.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.510

<font> Sir R. <$$font> $Then {TEXT:Theu} could not you, my dear
Sir <paren> as you are going to be separated <$$paren>, could not $you

- It will be all the same to him, I dare say, INCHBALD-1793-2,46.512

and I shall like it much better.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.513

<font> Pla. <$$font> Ours will not be a divorce, consider, but
merely a separate maintenance.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.514

But were it otherwise, I wish no man so ill, as to wish him married to
Mrs. Placid.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.515

<font> Sir R. <$$font> That is my case exactly.
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.516

I wish no man so ill, as to wish him married to my Lady Ramble; and
poor old Solus in particular, poor old man!  a very good sort of a man -
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.517

I have a great friendship for Solus.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.518

- I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} stay a moment in the house -
INCHBALD-1793-2,46.519

I must go somewhere - INCHBALD-1793-2,46.520

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go to Solus.  INCHBALD-1793-2,46.521

- No, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go <P_47> to Lord Norland -
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.522

No, I will go to Harmony; INCHBALD-1793-2,47.523

and then $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} call on you, INCHBALD-1793-2,47.524

Scene I.  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.530

<font> An Apartment at Mr. <$$font> Harmony <font>'s.
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.531

Enter Mr. <$$font> Harmony.  <$$heading> INCHBALD-1793-2,47.532

Harmony.  And now, for one of the most painful tasks that brotherly love
ever draw upon me; to tell another, the suit, of which I gave him hope,
has failed.  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.533

- Yet, if I can but overcome Captain Irwin's delicacy so far, as to
prevail on him to accept one proof more of my good wishes towards him;
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.534

- but to a man of his nice sense of obligations, the offer must be made
with caution.  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.535

<font> Enter Lord Norland.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,47.536

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Mr Harmony, I beg your pardon:
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.537

I come in thus abruptly, from the anxiety I feel concerning
what passed between us this morning in respect to Miss Wooburn.
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.538

You have not changed your mind, I hope?  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.539

<font> Har. <$$font> Indeed, my Lord, I am very sorry that it
will not be in my power to oblige you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.540

<font> Lord N. <$$font> <paren> <font> in anger.  <$$font>
<$$paren> How, Sir?  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.541

Did not you give me your word?  INCHBALD-1793-2,47.542

<font> Har. <$$font> Only conditionally, my Lord.
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.543

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And what were the conditions?
INCHBALD-1793-2,47.544

<P_48>

<font> Har. <$$font> Have you forgot them?  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.546

<font> Ser. <$$font> Sir Robert Ramble is in his carriage at the

and, if you are at leisure, will come in.  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.550

<font> Har. <$$font> Desire him to walk up.  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.551

<paren> <font> Going to the opposite door.  <$$font> <$$paren> Can I go

<font> Har. <$$font> Why should you shun him?
INCHBALD-1793-2,48.556

<font> Lord N. <$$font> because he used his wife ill.
INCHBALD-1793-2,48.557

<font> Har. <$$font> He did.  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.558

But I believe he is very sorry for it.  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.559

- And as for you, he said to me only a few hours ago -
INCHBALD-1793-2,48.560

but no matter.  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.561

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What did he say?  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.562

I insist upon knowing.  INCHBALD-1793-2,48.563

<font> Har. <$$font> Why then he said,"that if he had a sacred

earth, to whom he will confide it. "INCHBALD-1793-2,48.564

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Well, I am in no hurry;

And - your Ward, Sir - Miss Wooburn - I hope, my Lord, she is well?
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.587

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Yes, Sir Robert, Miss Wooburn is tolerably

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Only tolerably, my Lord?
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.589

I am sorry for that.  INCHBALD-1793-2,49.590

<font> Har. <$$font> I hope, my Lord, you will excuse my mentioning

but I was telling Sir Robert just now, of your intentions respecting a
second marriage for that Lady; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.592

but Sir Robert does not appear to approve of the design.
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.593

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What objection can <font> he <$$font> have?
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.594

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My Lord, there are such a number of bad
husbands; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.595

there are such a number of dissipated, unthinking, unprincipled men!
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.596

- And - I should be extremely sorry to see any Lady with whom I have had
the honour of being so closely allied, united to one who would undervalue
her worth.  INCHBALD-1793-2,49.597

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Pray, Sir Robert, were you not
then extremely sorry for her, while she was united to you?
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.598

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Very sorry for her indeed, my Lord.
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.599

But, at that time, my mind was so taken up with other cares, I own I
did not feel the compassion which was her due; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.600

but now that I am single, I shall have leisure to pay her more attention
; INCHBALD-1793-2,49.601

and should I find her unhappy, it must, inevitably, make me so.
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.602

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Depend upon it, that on the present
occasion, I shall take infinite care in the choice of her husband.
INCHBALD-1793-2,49.603

<font> Sir R. <$$font> If your Lordship would permit me to <P_50>
have an interview with Miss Wooburn, I think I should be able at least -
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.604

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You would not sure insult her by your
presence?  INCHBALD-1793-2,50.605

<font> Sir R. <$$font> I think I should be able at least to point
out an object worthy of her taste - INCHBALD-1793-2,50.606

I know what she will like better than any body in the world.
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.607

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Her request has been, that I may point
her out a husband the reverse of you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,50.608

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Then, upon my honour, my Lord, she $wo

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes, my Lord, perhaps I have,
INCHBALD-1793-2,50.611

INCHBALD-1793-2,50.616

this is my will: INCHBALD-1793-2,50.622

Will your Lordship do me the favour to forget it?  INCHBALD-1793-2,50.629

<font> Lord N. <$$font> What did he say?  INCHBALD-1793-2,51.636

<font> Har. <$$font> That he thought your conduct that of a just
and an upright man.  INCHBALD-1793-2,51.637

<font> Lord N. <$$font> To say the truth, he has gone away with
better manners than I could have imagined, considering his jealousy
is provoked.  INCHBALD-1793-2,51.638

<font> Har. <$$font> Ah!  I always knew he loved his wife,
notwithstanding his behaviour to her; INCHBALD-1793-2,51.639

for, if you remember, he always spoke well of her behind her back.
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.640

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No, I do not remember it.
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.641

<font> Har. <$$font> Yes, he did; INCHBALD-1793-2,51.642

<font> Ed. <$$font> Oh, my Lord, I beg your pardon for coming

but I come to tell you something you will be glad to hear.
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.653

<font> Har. <$$font> Good heaven!  how like his mother!
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.654

<font> Lord N. <$$font> <paren> <font> Taking him by the hand.
<$$font> <$$paren> I begin to think he is - INCHBALD-1793-2,51.655

but he was not so when I first took him.  INCHBALD-1793-2,51.656

No, no, if he had, he would not have been thus near me now;
INCHBALD-1793-2,51.657

but to turn him away, because his countenance is a little changed,
I think would not be right.  INCHBALD-1793-2,51.658

<P_52>

<font> Ed. <$$font> <paren> <font> to <$$font> Harmony.  <$$paren>
Pray, Sir, did you know my mother.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.660

<font> Har. <$$font> I have seen her.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.661

<font> Ed. <$$font> Did <font> you <$$font> ever see her, my Lord?
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.662

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I thought you had orders never to enquire
about your parents?  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.663

Have you forgot those orders?  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.664

<font> Ed. <$$font> No, my Lord; but when this gentleman
$said {TEXT:sai} I was like my mother - it put me in mind of her.
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.665

<font> Har. <$$font> You do not remember your mother, do you?
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.666

<font> Ed. <$$font> Sometimes I think I do.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.667

I think sometimes I remember her kissing me, when she and my father went
on board of a ship; INCHBALD-1793-2,52.668

and so hard she pressed me - I think I feel it now.
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.669

<font> Har. <$$font> Perhaps she was the only Lady that ever
saluted you?  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.670

<font> Ed. <$$font> No, Sir, not by many.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.671

<font> Lord N. <$$font> But pray young man, <paren> to

INCHBALD-1793-2,52.672

You seem to have forgot your errand?  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.673

<font> Ed. <$$font> And so I had, upon my word.
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.674

Speaking of my mother, put it quite out of my head.
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.675

But, my Lord, I came to let you know, the robber who stopped you last
night is taken.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.676

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I am glad to hear it.
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.677

<font> Ed. <$$font> I knew you would, INCHBALD-1793-2,52.678

and therefore I begged to be the first to tell you.

<font> Har. <$$font> <paren> <font> to Lord <$$font> Norland.
<$$paren> Should you know the person again?  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.680

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say I should,
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.681

his face seemed so much distorted.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.682

<font> Har. <$$font> Ay, wretched man!  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.683

I suppose with terror.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.684

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No; it appeared a different passion
from fear.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.685

<font> Ed. <$$font> Perhaps, my Lord, it was <font> your <$$font>
fear that made you think so.  INCHBALD-1793-2,52.686

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No, Sir, I was not frightened.
INCHBALD-1793-2,52.687

<P_53>

<font> Ed. <$$font> Then why did you give him your money?
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.689

<font> Lord N. <$$font> It was surprise caused me to do that.
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.690

<font> Ed. <$$font> I wondered what it was!  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.691

You said it was not fear, INCHBALD-1793-2,53.692

and I was sure it could not be love.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.693

<font> Har. <$$font> How has he been taken?  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.694

<font> Ed. <$$font> A person came to our steward,
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.695

and informed against him; INCHBALD-1793-2,53.696

and, Oh!  my Lord, his poor wife told the officers who took him, they
had met with misfortunes, which she feared had caused a fever in her
husband's head; INCHBALD-1793-2,53.697

and, indeed; they found him too ill to be removed; INCHBALD-1793-2,53.698

and so, she hoped, she said,"that as a man, not in his perfect mind,
you would be merciful to him. "INCHBALD-1793-2,53.699

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I will be just.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.700

<font> Ed. <$$font> And that is being merciful, is it not, my Lord?
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.701

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Not always.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.702

<font> Ed. <$$font> I thought it had been.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.703

- It is not <font> just <$$font> to be unmerciful, is it?
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.704

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Certainly not.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.705

<font> Ed. <$$font> Then it must be <font> just, <$$font> to
have mercy.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.706

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You draw a false conclusion.
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.707

Great as is the virtue of <font> mercy, justice <$$font> is greater still.
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.708

justice holds its place among those cardinal virtues which include all
the lesser.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.709

- Come, Mr Harmony, will you go home with me?  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.710

And before I attend to this business, let me persuade you, to forget
there is such a person in the world as Sir Robert, INCHBALD-1793-2,53.711

and suffer me to introduce you to Miss Wooburn, as the man who -
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.712

<font> Har. <$$font> I beg to be excused - INCHBALD-1793-2,53.713

Besides the consideration of Sir Robert, I have another reason why I
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} go with you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,53.714

The melancholy tale which this young gentleman has been telling, has cast
a gloom on my spirits which renders me unfit for the society of a Lady.
INCHBALD-1793-2,53.715

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Now I should not be surprised were <P_54>
you to go in search of this culprit and his family, and come to me,
to entreat me to forego the prosecution; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.716

but, before you ask me, I tell you it is in vain - INCHBALD-1793-2,54.717

I will not.  INCHBALD-1793-2,54.718

<font> Har. <$$font> Lord Norland, I have lately been so
unsuccessful in my petitions to you, I shall never presume to interpose
between your rigour and a weak sufferer more.  INCHBALD-1793-2,54.719

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Plead the cause of the good, and I will
listen; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.720

but you find none but the wicked for your compassion.
INCHBALD-1793-2,54.721

<font> Har. <$$font> The good in all states, even in the very
jaws of death, are objects of envy; INCHBALD-1793-2,54.722

it is the bad who are the only real sufferers: INCHBALD-1793-2,54.723

There, where no internal consolation cheers, who can refuse a little
external comfort?  INCHBALD-1793-2,54.724

- And let me tell you, my Lord, that amidst all your authority, your
state, your grandeur, I often pity you.  <paren> <font> Speaking with
unaffected compassion.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,54.725

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Good-day, Mr Harmony;
INCHBALD-1793-2,54.726

and when you have apologised for what you have said, we may be friends

INCHBALD-1793-2,54.729

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} INCHBALD-1793-2,54.730

<font> Miss W. <$$font> You are impertinent, Sir.
INCHBALD-1793-2,57.808

<font> Ed. <$$font> What, for coming in?  INCHBALD-1793-2,57.809

I will go away then.  INCHBALD-1793-2,57.810

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Do, do - INCHBALD-1793-2,57.811

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} a good boy - INCHBALD-1793-2,57.812

do.  INCHBALD-1793-2,57.813

<font> Ed. <$$font> <paren> <font> going, returns.  <$$font>
<$$paren> - I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help laughing, though, to see you
two together!  INCHBALD-1793-2,57.814

- For you know you never were together when you lived in the same house.
INCHBALD-1793-2,57.815

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Leave the room instantly, Sir, or I shall
call Lord Norland.  INCHBALD-1793-2,57.816

<font> Ed. <$$font> Oh, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} take that trouble ,
INCHBALD-1793-2,57.817

I will call him myself.  INCHBALD-1793-2,57.818

<paren> <font> Runs to the door.  <$$font> <$$paren> -
INCHBALD-1793-2,57.819

My Lord, my Lord, pray come here this moment - INCHBALD-1793-2,57.820

As I am alive, here is Sir Robert Ramble along with Lady Ramble!
INCHBALD-1793-2,57.821

<P_58>

<font> Enter Lord <$$font> Norland.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.823

<font> Sir <$$font> Robert <font> looks confounded, INCHBALD-1793-2,58.824

Lord <$$font> Norland <font> points to <$$font> Edward <font> to leave
the room.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,58.825

<paren> <font> Exit <$$font> Edward.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.826

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Sir Robert, on what pretence do you
come hither?  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.827

<font> Sir R. <$$font> On the same pretence, as when I was for
the first time admitted into your house; to solicit this Lady's hand.
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.828

And, after having had it once, no force shall compel me to take a refusal.
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.829

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I will try however - INCHBALD-1793-2,58.830

Madam, quit the room instantly.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.831

<font> Sir R. <$$font> My Lord, she shall not quit it.
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.832

<font> Lord N. <$$font> I command her to go.
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.833

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And I command her to stay.
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.834

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Which of us will you obey?
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.835

<font> Miss W. <$$font> My inclination, my Lord, disposes me to
obey you; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.836

- but I have so lately been accustomed to obey him, that <font> custom
<$$font> inclines me to obey him still.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.837

<font> Sir R. <$$font> There!  There!  There, my Lord!
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.838

Now I hope you will understand better for the future, and not attempt
to interfere between a man and his wife.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.839

<font> Lord N. <$$font> <paren> <font> to her.  <$$font> <$$paren>
Be explicit in your answer to this question - INCHBALD-1793-2,58.840

Will you consent to be his wife?  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.841

<font> Miss W. <$$font> No, never.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.842

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Zounds, my Lord, now you are hurrying
matters.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.843

- You should do it by gentle means; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.844

- let me ask her gently.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.845

<paren> <font> With a most soft voice.  <$$font> <$$paren> Maria, Maria,
will you be my wife once again?  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.846

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Never.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.847

<font> Sir R. <$$font> So you said seven years ago, when I asked
you, INCHBALD-1793-2,58.848

and yet you consented.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.849

<font> Lord N. <$$font> And now, Sir Robert, you have had your
answer; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.850

leave my house.  <paren> <font> Going up to him.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,58.851

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes, Sir; INCHBALD-1793-2,58.852

but not without my other half.  INCHBALD-1793-2,58.853

<font> Lord N. <$$font>"Your other half? " INCHBALD-1793-2,58.854

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Yes, the wife of my bosom - the wife,
<P_59> whom I swore at the altar"to love and to cherish,"and,
forsaking all others, cleave only to her as"long as we both should
live. "INCHBALD-1793-2,59.855

<font> Lord N. <$$font> You broke your oath, INCHBALD-1793-2,59.856

and made the contract void.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.857

<font> Sir R. <$$font> But I am ready to take another oath;
and another after that, and another after that - INCHBALD-1793-2,59.858

And, Oh, my dear Maria, be propitious to my vows, INCHBALD-1793-2,59.859

and give me hopes you will again be mine.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.860

<paren> <font> He goes to her, INCHBALD-1793-2,59.861

and kneels in the most supplicating attitude.  <$$font> <$$paren>
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.862

<font> Enter <$$font> Edward, <font> shewing in Mr <$$font> Solus <font>
and Mr <$$font> Placid; INCHBALD-1793-2,59.863

Edward <font> points to Sir <$$font> Robert <paren> <font> who has his
back to them <$$font> <$$paren> INCHBALD-1793-2,59.864

<font> and goes off.  <$$font> INCHBALD-1793-2,59.865

<font> Sir R. <$$font> <paren> <font> Still on his knees, and not
perceiving their entrance.  <$$font> <$$paren> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
live without you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.866

- Receive your penitent husband, thus humbly acknowledging his faults,
and imploring you to accept him once again.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.867

<font> Sol. <$$font> <paren> <font> Going up to Sir <$$font>
Robert.  <$$paren> Now, is it wonderful that I should want a wife.
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.868

<font> Pla. <$$font> And is it to be wondered at, if I should
hesitate about parting with mine?  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.869

<font> Sir R. <$$font> <paren> <font> Starts up in great confusion
.  <$$font> <$$paren> Mr Solus, Mr Placid, I am highly displeased that
my private actions should be thus inspected.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.870

<font> Sol. <$$font> No one shall persuade me now, to live a day
without a wife.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.871

<font> Pla. <$$font> And no one shall persuade me now, not to be
content with my own.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.872

<font> Sol. <$$font> I will procure a special licence, and marry
the first woman I meet.  INCHBALD-1793-2,59.873

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Mr Solus, you are, I believe,
interested in a peculiar manner, about the marriage of this Lady.
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.874

<font> Sol. <$$font> And poor man, you are sick,
INCHBALD-1793-2,59.875

and want somebody to"bathe your temples,"and to"hover about you.
"INCHBALD-1793-2,59.876

<font> Miss W. <$$font> You come in most opportunely, my dear
<P_60> Mr Solus, to be a witness - INCHBALD-1793-2,60.877

<font> Sir R. <$$font>"My dear Mr Solus! " INCHBALD-1793-2,60.878

<font> Sol. <$$font> To be a witness, Madam, that a man is
miserable without a wife.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.879

I have been a fatal instance of that, for some time.
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.880

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Come to me then, INCHBALD-1793-2,60.881

and receive a lesson.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.882

<font> Sir R. <$$font> No, Madam, he shall not come to you;
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.883

nor shall he receive a lesson.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.884

No one shall receive a lesson from you, but me.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.885

<font> Lord N. <$$font> Sir Robert, one would suppose by this
extraordinary behaviour, you were jealous.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.886

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And so I am, my Lord; INCHBALD-1793-2,60.887

I have cause to be so.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.888

<font> Lord N. <$$font> No cause to be jealous of Mr Solus -
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.889

He is not Miss Wooburn's lover, I assure you.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.890

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Then, my Lord, I verily believe it is
yourself.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.891

Yes, I can see it is; INCHBALD-1793-2,60.892

I can see it by her eyes, and by every feature in your face.
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.893

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Oh!  my good friend, Mr Placid, only
listen to him.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.894

<font> Sir R. <$$font> And why"my good friend, Mr Placid?
"INCHBALD-1793-2,60.895

<paren> <font> To <$$font> Placid.  <$$paren> By Heavens, Sir, I believe
that you only wished to get rid of your own wife, in order to marry mine.
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.896

<font> Pla. <$$font> I do not wish to part with my own wife,
Sir Robert, since what I have just seen.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.897

<font> Sir R. <paren> Going up to <$$font> Solus <font> and Lord
<$$font> Norland.  <$$paren> Then, pray, gentlemen, be so good as to tell
me, which of you two is the happy man, that I may know how to conduct
myself towards him?  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.898

<font> Miss W. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.899

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Do you insult me, Maria?
INCHBALD-1793-2,60.900

- Oh!  have pity on my sufferings.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.901

<font> Sol. <$$font> If you have a mind to kneel down again,
we will go out of the room.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.902

<font> Pla. <$$font> just as I was comforting myself with the
prospect of a divorce, I find my instructor and director pleading on
his knees to be remarried.  INCHBALD-1793-2,60.903

<P_61>

<font> Enter Mrs <$$font> Placid.  INCHBALD-1793-2,61.905

<font> Mrs Pla. <$$font> What were you saying about a divorce?
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.906

<font> Sir R. <$$font> Now, down on your knees,
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.907

and beg pardon.  INCHBALD-1793-2,61.908

<font> Miss W. <$$font> My dear Mrs Placid, if this visit is to
me, I take it very kind.  INCHBALD-1793-2,61.909

<font> Mrs Pla. <$$font> Not absolutely to you, my dear.
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.910

I saw Mr Placid's carriage at the door, INCHBALD-1793-2,61.911

and so I stepped in to desire him to go home.  INCHBALD-1793-2,61.912

Go home directly.  INCHBALD-1793-2,61.913

<font> Pla. <$$font> Presently, my dear; I will go presently.
INCHBALD-1793-2,61.914
