My awful Dad.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.3

Act I.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.4

<$$heading>

Scene I - MATHEWS-1875-2,3.6

Richard Evergreen's <font> chambers.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.7

Doors in flat <$$font> C., <font> opening on to stair-case.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.8

Easy chair and large writing table covered with papers, B.
C. MATHEWS-1875-2,3.9

Press, with alphabetical divisions, against flat R. H.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.10

Barrister's gown and wig hanging on peg between press and door.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.11

Watch in case on table.  <$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,3.12

Fibs, Nibs, <font> and <$$font> Dibs <font> discovered, looking over a
map on table.  <$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,3.13

Fibs.  There, that red line you see is where the party wall now is,
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.14

and that dotted line is where the party wall ought to be,
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.15

at least so the plaintiff says.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.16

Nibs.  Why, it $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} a {COM:sic} above two foot or
{COM:sic} difference according to the scale.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.17

Fibs.  It has caused a bigger difference between the parties, anyhow.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.18

Nibs.  $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} copied more opinions than would cover it all
without counting the margin.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.19

Dibs.  And is that little strip what $they $'ve {TEXT:they've} been
fighting these two years?  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.20

All for a few inches of ground!  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.21

Fibs.  Few inches, indeed!  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.22

You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what $you $'re {TEXT:you're} talking about.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.23

Why one inch of ground is ground enough for an action.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.24

Dibs.  To my certain knowledge, it has cost hundreds already, if only
in counsels'fees.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.25

What nonsense it is, $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} it, that parties should
throw their money away like that, about what is worth nothing.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.26

Fibs.  How can you be such a fool, Dibs?  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.27

If people only quarrelled about what was worth quarrelling about,
lawyers must starve.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.28

Worth money indeed!  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.29

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} been worth a mint to our governor.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.30

The fees he has pocketted are incalculable.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.31

Dibs.  No, they are not, MATHEWS-1875-2,3.32

for $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} calculated them.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.33

Nibs.  Well, $they $'ve {TEXT:they've} finished their journeys when $they
$'ve {TEXT:they've} got into the governor's pocket.  MATHEWS-1875-2,3.34

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} like Chancery - MATHEWS-1875-2,3.35

once in, they $do $n't {TEXT:don't} get out again in a hurry.
MATHEWS-1875-2,3.36

<P_4>

Fibs.  $It $'s {TEXT:It's} lucky they $do $n't {TEXT:don't} go into his
father's, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.38

- they $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} stay long there.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.39

Nibs.  No.  As soon as they were put into the hole at the top, $they
$'d {TEXT:they'd} run out at the hole at the bottom.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.40

Dibs.  Oh, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a regular sieve, he is.
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.41

$Ai $n't {TEXT:Ain't} he a jolly old cock!  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.42

Nibs.  What, the Major?  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.43

- there $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} a better old chap going.
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.44

Fibs.  I only wish his son were like him.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.45

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} a closefisted card and no mistake.
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.46

Dibs.  I say, Fibs, what do they call him the Major for?
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.47

He $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} been in the army, have he?  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.48

Fibs.  Not he.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.49

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know; MATHEWS-1875-2,4.50

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think he knows himself.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.51

He always says,"$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} call me Mr. Evergreen -
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.52

I shall be taken for my son.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.53

Call me the Major. "MATHEWS-1875-2,4.54

So we call him so.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.55

Dibs.  I thought he was a retired officer.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.56

Fibs.  Not a bit of it.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.57

He lives on the governor.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.58

Nibs.  Then $he $'s {TEXT:he's} on half-pay, I know?  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.59

Fibs.  But be off, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.60

here is the governor.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.61

<paren> <font> rolls up map MATHEWS-1875-2,4.62

and puts it on table.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.63

Exeunt <$$font> Dibs <font> and <$$font> Nibs, L. 2 E.
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.64

<font> Enter <$$font> Dick, R. U. E. <$$paren>
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.65

Dick.  Fibs, has that brief come down yet from Skinners?
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.66

Fibs.  I think not, sir, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.67

but $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go and see.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.68

Dick.  Why, it must be past - <paren> <font> takes up watch from table
<$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,4.69

Deuce take it, my watch has stopped again.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.70

<paren> <font> puts it back <$$font> <$$paren> Yes, go.
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.71

Fibs.  I will, sir.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.72

<paren> <font> Exit <$$font>, L. <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,4.73

Dick.  What dilatory people they are.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.74

I could have read it over while at breakfast; not that that would have
given me much time.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.75

A cup of tea and an egg are soon despatched, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.76

and I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} allow myself more.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.77

How I am obliged to screw, to be sure, to make both ends meet, and keep
up appearances.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.78

A rising barrister has his secret privations and sorrows,
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.79

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} certain.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.80

However, I $must $n't {TEXT:mustn't} complain.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.81

The sun shines pretty bright before me, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.82

only there are spots upon it - one very large spot that no one knows
of but myself, a blight upon my existence, instead of a fostering ray.
A will-o'-the-wisp instead of a warning beacon, or a guiding star.
A domestic anaconda who eats me out of house and home, swallows up all
I get and is never satisfied.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.83

Well, we must all be born I suppose, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.84

and to be born we must have fathers, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.85

and I have mine.  MATHEWS-1875-2,4.86

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} not my fault; MATHEWS-1875-2,4.87

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} bring him into the world, though he did me,
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.88

so I am not answerable for his follies, MATHEWS-1875-2,4.89

and must bear the mill-stone round my neck with resignation.
MATHEWS-1875-2,4.90

<paren> <font> goes to table <$$font> <$$paren> <P_5> Oh, if I could
only pick up a nice little wife now with a few thousands in her pockets!
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.91

But what nonsense I am talking, MATHEWS-1875-2,5.92

such things are not to be found on every bush.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.93

One may as well look for a nugget in a chandler's shop.
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.94

<paren> <font> calling <$$font> <$$paren> Mrs. Biggs!
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.95

<font> Enter <$$font> Mrs. Biggs <font> with paper hat-box.
<$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,5.96

Mrs. B. Law, sir!  Have you done your breakfast already?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.97

Dick.  Already!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.98

How long do you suppose it takes to swallow an egg and a cup of tea?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.99

Mrs. B. Then why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you have two
eggs and two cups of tea, like that dear old gentleman, your father?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.100

He makes a good breakfast, I can tell you.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.101

Ham and kidneys and - MATHEWS-1875-2,5.102

Dick.  That will do.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.103

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Of course he does.
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.104

The anaconda spares himself nothing - while I - MATHEWS-1875-2,5.105

What have you got there?  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.106

Mrs. B. Your hat, sir, that went to be done up.
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.107

Dick.  Put it down.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.108

<paren> <font> she puts it on table <$$font> <$$paren>
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.109

By-the-bye, has my father had his breakfast?  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.110

Mrs. B. I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know, indeed, sir.
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.111

Dick.  What, $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} he up yet?  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.112

Mrs. B. No, sir, he $can $n't {TEXT:can't} be said to be
up, MATHEWS-1875-2,5.113

for he has never been to bed!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.114

Dick.  Not been to bed!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.115

What do you mean?  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.116

Mrs. B. Nothing, sir, MATHEWS-1875-2,5.117

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} be angry; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.118

only he has not been home all night.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.119

Dick.  What!  Again!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.120

Oh, dear me, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} incorrigible!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.121

Mrs. B. Yes, sir; it $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} quite the thing,
is it, sir?  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.122

He railly ought to reform.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.123

But $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} afraid $he $'s {TEXT:he's} too old now;
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.124

he has got habits like MATHEWS-1875-2,5.125

and $can $n't {TEXT:can't} change them.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.126

Dick.  Very bad habits, Mrs. Biggs.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.127

Mrs. B. So they are, sir; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.128

but what a nice gentleman he is, $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} he, sir?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.129

Dick.  Hold your tongue, Mrs. Biggs.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.130

A pretty example he sets me - his son.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.131

Mrs. B. So he does, sir; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.132

but you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} foller it, do you, sir?
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.133

Dick.  Follow it!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.134

I should think not, indeed.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.135

Mrs. B. Not you, sir.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.136

His conduct certainly is - MATHEWS-1875-2,5.137

$there $'s {TEXT:there's} no word for it.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.138

Dick.  Yes, there is, Mrs. Biggs.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.139

Scandalous, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the word.  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.140

Mrs. B. At his age, too!  MATHEWS-1875-2,5.141

Turned fifty!  Not that anyone would think it; MATHEWS-1875-2,5.142

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sure he looks young enough to be your -
MATHEWS-1875-2,5.143

<P_6>

Dick.  That will do, Mrs. Biggs.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.145

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want your observations.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.146

Mrs. B. No, sir, in course you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} ;
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.147

but I do say $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a pity.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.148

He is such a nice man, so good-natured and so liberal.
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.149

Oh!  $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} he liberal, MATHEWS-1875-2,6.150

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} all?  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.151

Dick.  How do you know?  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.152

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> Liberal, of course he is with
<font> my <$$font> money.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.153

Mrs. B. Oh, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} <font> know <$$font>
, MATHEWS-1875-2,6.154

only the Major talks and acts as if he $were $n't {TEXT:weren't} more
than twenty.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.155

Dick.  The Major indeed!  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.156

I will <font> not <$$font> have him called the Major.
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.157

Mrs. B. Why, sir, he calls hisself so.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.158

What am I to call him, then?  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.159

Dick.  Mr. Evergreen, senior.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.160

Mrs. B. Senior?  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.161

Oh, my stars!  he $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} much like a senior - much more
like major to my thinking.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.162

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} younger than you are, sir, MATHEWS-1875-2,6.163

that I <font> will <$$font> say.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.164

Dick.  $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} trouble you not to say anything of the kind ,
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.165

but mind your own business.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.166

Mrs. B. Certainly, sir; MATHEWS-1875-2,6.167

only one $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help thinking what a pity he $can
$n't {TEXT:can't} be made to settle down quietly at home, instead of
rantipoling about all night.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.168

Law, sir!  how we would pet him and make him comfortable.
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.169

For my part $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} go through fire and water for him,
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.170

that I would!  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.171

Dick.  Mrs. Biggs, how dare you!  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.172

I forbid you to go through fire and water for my father.
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.173

Mrs. B. Well, I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}, sir;
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.174

but you railly ought to scold him well, and make him give up his bad
habits.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.175

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} time he sowed his wild oats.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.176

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sure when $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} alone sometimes it makes
me cry to think of it.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.177

Dick.  And pray what have you to do with it?  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.178

Surely my $father $'s {TEXT:father's} his own master, MATHEWS-1875-2,6.179

and can do as he pleases without your permission.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.180

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} of age, MATHEWS-1875-2,6.181

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} a widower, MATHEWS-1875-2,6.182

MATHEWS-1875-2,6.183

he has board and lodging gratis.  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.184

What more would he have?  MATHEWS-1875-2,6.185

Now I tell you what, Mrs. Biggs, and once for all -
MATHEWS-1875-2,6.186

if you dare to cry for my father when you are alone $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll}
give up these chambers at once, and look for a less sympathetic laundress.

pipe out, is it, Dick?  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.233

Ha!  ha!  ha!  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.234

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> $He $'s {TEXT:He's} not jocular
this morning - MATHEWS-1875-2,7.235

the $row $'s {TEXT:row's} coming.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.236

Dick.  I congratulate you, sir; MATHEWS-1875-2,7.237

$you $'ve {TEXT:you've} come home at a nice hour.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.238

Ever. Ten o'clock, Dick.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.239

Just ten.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.240

Not so very late.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.241

Dick.  I hope you had a pleasant evening?  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.242

Ever. Tidy, Dick.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.243

Pretty fair!  Pretty fair!  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.244

Dick.  I trust you $have $n't {TEXT:haven't} hurried home on my account?
MATHEWS-1875-2,7.245

Ever. No, I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} hurry.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.246

Dick.  Some precious orgie, I suppose, as usual?  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.247

Ever. No, Dick.  Nothing of the kind.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.248

If you like, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} give you an account of every moment of
my time, MATHEWS-1875-2,7.249

First I went - MATHEWS-1875-2,7.250

Dick.  Thank you, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} rather not.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.251

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want to hear the details of your midnight
debaucheries.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.252

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} the old story, Bacchanalian, Saturnalia, that would
disgrace even the Romans in their decline and fall.  MATHEWS-1875-2,7.253

<P_8>

Ever. $Wo $n't {TEXT:Won't} do, Dick - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.255

the comparison fails - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.256

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not like the Romans.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.257

I never decline, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.258

and I never fall.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.259

Dick.  The same eternal round of wine and women and flowers.  Ever.
And pool - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.260

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} forget pool - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.261

come, come, Dick, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.262

shake hands with your old father.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.263

Dick.  Old!  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.264

I wish he was old!  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.265

Ever. Well, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} a compliment at any rate.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.266

All in good time, my boy - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.267

all in good time.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.268

We $can $n't {TEXT:can't} all grow old in a minute like you.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.269

You sprang like Minerva from the brain of Jove, armed cap-a`-pie -
all the better for you; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.270

but make allowances for the weakness of those who have been less favoured.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.271

There, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} look so serious.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.272

Why $can $n't {TEXT:can't} you be jovial and pleasant like me?
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.273

Dick.  Seriousness is my profession.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.274

Ever. And $liberty $'s {TEXT:liberty's} mine.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.275

So $let $'s {TEXT:let's} each follow our vocation.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.276

Why a parson might as well reproach a mountebank for throwing a
somersault.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.277

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} the way he gets his living.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.278

The parson has got his living; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.279

so they $do $n't {TEXT:don't} meet on equal terms.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.280

The somersault that adorns the saw-dust would, I grant you, be
inappropriate in the pulpit - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.281

each has his mode of self-assertion, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.282

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} all.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.283

The parson says"Here I am,"MATHEWS-1875-2,8.284

the clown says"Here we are. "MATHEWS-1875-2,8.285

$What $'s {TEXT:What's} the difference?  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.286

The clown adopts the legal plural, the parson the parochial singular.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.287

That is our case.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.288

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} the regal plural, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.289

you are the legal singular.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.290

Dick.  Pooh!  $there $'s {TEXT:there's} no arguing with you.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.291

Ever. I know it.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.292

Then why argue?  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.293

our states are apart.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.294

It takes a long time, of course, for a grub to become a butterfly.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.295

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} a butterfly; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.296

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} arrived.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.297

$You $'re {TEXT:You're} still plodding on; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.298

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} the grub.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.299

Dick.  <paren> <font> rises <$$font> <$$paren> Thank you;
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.300

you are complimentary at any rate.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.301

Ever. Not at all; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.302

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} the plain truth without flattery.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.303

Come, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.304

burst your shell - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.305

let out, my boy - MATHEWS-1875-2,8.306

be gay and joyous.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.307

Make a pun, Dick, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.308

make a pun; MATHEWS-1875-2,8.309

it will do you a world of good.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.310

Dick.  I never made a pun in my life.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.311

Ever. I know you $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}, MATHEWS-1875-2,8.312

so $it $'s {TEXT:it's} time you began.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.313

You ought to be ashamed of yourself at your time of life.
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.314

Dick.  Doctor Johnson says,"The man who would make a pun would pick a
pocket. "MATHEWS-1875-2,8.315

Ever. Bosh!  Men who make puns never pick pockets;
MATHEWS-1875-2,8.316

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} quite the other way.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.317

$You $'re {TEXT:You're} an illustration.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.318

You never make puns MATHEWS-1875-2,8.319

and you are picking pockets all day long.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.320

Dick.  Only in the way of my profession, dad, only in the way of my
profession.  MATHEWS-1875-2,8.321

<P_9>

Ever. The way of your profession - $that $'s {TEXT:that's} good!
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.323

why a foot-pad might make the same excuse.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.324

Hang it all!  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.325

be alive.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.326

One would think that you were my father instead of I yours.
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.327

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} deuced glad $you $'re {TEXT:you're} not though.
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.328

I should be traced every five minutes.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.329

Birch-brooms would be at a premium.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.330

And after all $what $'s {TEXT:what's} my crime.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.331

Preferring pleasant society out of doors to dulness within;
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.332

for, my dear Dick, if you think you are pleasant company you are mistaken.
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.333

Surely $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} done enough for you in my time,
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.334

and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} but right you should do a little for me.
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.335

$Did $n't {TEXT:Didn't} I pay your quarterly school bills, and your
quarterly broken windows?  Which I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} believe you
ever broke.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.336

You never were young enough for that.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.337

$Did $n't {TEXT:Didn't} I say to you,"Dick, $you $'re {TEXT:you're}
an old man of ten.  A pedantic little ant.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.338

$You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} never set the Thames on fire, MATHEWS-1875-2,9.339

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} not agreeable, MATHEWS-1875-2,9.340

and $you $'re {TEXT:you're} not good-looking; MATHEWS-1875-2,9.341

but $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} do for a lawyer. "MATHEWS-1875-2,9.342

And $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} I, like a Spartan of old, dine off my solitary
chop, red on one side and black on the other, at the tavern round the
corner, while you were eating your terms?  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.343

And devilish good eating, too, by all accounts.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.344

And now you are a rising barrister - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.345

think of that!  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.346

How many barristers never rise, except in the morning?
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.347

$Did $n't {TEXT:Didn't} I set you an example of temperance and sobriety?
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.348

and you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} even thank me for your being able to
breakfast on a cup of tea and an egg, instead of indulging in all sorts
of indigestible <font> cates.  <$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,9.349

Dick.  Oh, yes!  I certainly thank you very greatly for <font> that.
<$$font> MATHEWS-1875-2,9.350

Ever. Very well, then.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.351

Let me have my time.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.352

I $sacrificed {TEXT:sacrified} the spring-time of my youth to <font>
you <$$font>, MATHEWS-1875-2,9.353

so $do $n't {TEXT:don't} begrudge me my little innocent pleasures.
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.354

Let me enjoy my Indian summer - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.355

let me catch the last rays of my setting sun, and kill time joyously -
till time kills me.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.356

Dick.  My dear dad, far would it be from me to grudge you your innocent
pleasures, as you call them; MATHEWS-1875-2,9.357

but I denounce them as irrational and immoral.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.358

Ever. Irrational?  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.359

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} good!  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.360

Do you call suppers irrational?  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.361

Do you call billiards immoral!  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.362

On the contrary, I follow Shakespeare's teaching -"Find tongues
in cheese, books in the flowing cup, sermons in pool, and good in
everything. "MATHEWS-1875-2,9.363

Dick.  Yes, in dice - in women - in - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.364

Ever. Stop - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.365

not a word against women.  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.366

They are angels - goddesses, when you are not <font> married <$$font>
to them - MATHEWS-1875-2,9.367

then, I grant you, you find out that they are merely women.
MATHEWS-1875-2,9.368

And yet see how long I endured your mother!  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.369

and all for what?  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.370

For you, you ungrateful varlet!  MATHEWS-1875-2,9.371

<P_10>

Dick.  Yes; but the women I speak of - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.373

Ever. Well, what of them?  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.374

- they $do $n't {TEXT:don't} harm you.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.375

Dick.  I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know that.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.376

When equivocal young females present themselves at my chambers and
mistake my room for yours - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.377

Ever. Pshaw!  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.378

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} easily remedied.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.379

Stick up a paper on your door -"The surly young bear just stepped out -
back in five minutes;"and under it"N. B. - The jolly old
Major always in form ten till four.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.380

Wipe your feet on the mat. "MATHEWS-1875-2,10.381

Dick.  There again, now why will you call yourself the Major when $you
$'re {TEXT:you're} not a major?  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.382

Ever. Not a major?  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.383

Who says $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not a major?  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.384

The deuce $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not!  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.385

Why $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} I a major?  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.386

You are Evergreen minor - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.387

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} Evergreen major, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.388

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} my commission - Ursa Minor - Ursa Major.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.389

Dick.  Yes, but people think that you are in the army.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.390

Ever. Well, let them think so; MATHEWS-1875-2,10.391

$there $'s {TEXT:there's} no disgrace in it, is there?
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.392

We $can $n't {TEXT:can't} all be lawyers.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.393

Dick.  Ah, my dear dad, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} too young for your age.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.394

Ever. And $you $'re {TEXT:you're} not young enough for yours.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.395

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} a relic of the good old school - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.396

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} a mushroom of the new.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.397

You are all utilitarian.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.398

I belong to the age of poetry and chivalry - when women were idols, and
we wrote sonnets to their eyebrows, when we ruined ourselves for a smile,
and risked our lives for a ribbon; MATHEWS-1875-2,10.399

and here I stand erect among you pigmy greybeards, the living statue of
eternal youth.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.400

Dick.  Go on, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.401

go on, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.402

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} on the popular side; MATHEWS-1875-2,10.403

as Mrs. Biggs said just now, you are only twenty.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.404

Ever. No, I am not twenty, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.405

but I try to act as if I were, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.406

and I succeed sometimes.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.407

Biggs is a shrewd old girl.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.408

By-the-bye, Dick, the $quarter $'s {TEXT:quarter's} nearly up.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.409

How time flies, $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} it?  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.410

And now everything flies with it <paren> <font> feeling in his pocket
<$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,10.411

Dick.  Yes, and that reminds me, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.412

I must fly down to Westminster.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.413

Ever. <paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> He $does $n't

<paren> <font> aloud <$$font> <$$paren> I say, Dickey, you $have $n't

MATHEWS-1875-2,10.415

Dick.  No.  I $have $n't {TEXT:haven't}.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.416

But $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you what I <font> have <$$font> got.

Ever. Oh, well $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} make a fiver do.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.418

A pound or two more or less $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} much matter.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.419

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not particular.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.420

Dick.  I know $you $'re {TEXT:you're} not, MATHEWS-1875-2,10.421

but I am.  MATHEWS-1875-2,10.422

Here are thirty-seven pounds two and ninepence - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.423

Ever. Oh, my dear Dick, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} too liberal.
MATHEWS-1875-2,10.424

I really $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want - MATHEWS-1875-2,10.425

<P_11>

Dick.  Which $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} paid for you during the last month.
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.427

There are the receipts and the County Court summonses.  <paren> <font>
giving papers <$$font> <$$paren> MATHEWS-1875-2,11.428

Ever. What the deuce did you pay them for?  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.429

It was no business of yours; MATHEWS-1875-2,11.430

they could have waited, MATHEWS-1875-2,11.431

they are used to it.  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.432

"A fig for care, a fig for woe.  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.433

If I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} pay, why I can owe. "MATHEWS-1875-2,11.434

You always seem to take the part of my creditors instead of mine.
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.435

Well, I suppose I must manage with two or three sovereigns, just till
I get my next quarter.  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.436

Ever. $What $'s {TEXT:What's} that?  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.443

a new hat?  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.444

You extravagant young dog!  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.445

Dick.  No, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} only an old one done up.
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.446

Ever. Why $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} you ask me?
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.447

I could have lent you an old one $that $'s {TEXT:that's} been done up
for some time, and have saved you the expense.  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.448

Dick.  I $dare $say {TEXT:daresay} you could - equally obliged.  <paren>

Dick.  I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want it; MATHEWS-1875-2,11.452

it has stopped.  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.453

MATHEWS-1875-2,11.459

Mrs. B. Like what, sir?  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.460

Ever. Fathers refusing money to their sons is common enough.
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.461

But sons refusing money to their fathers is something unheard of -
MATHEWS-1875-2,11.462

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} monstrous.  MATHEWS-1875-2,11.463

Ever. Certainly I will - MATHEWS-1875-2,14.610

pray speak out without reserve.  MATHEWS-1875-2,14.611

Mat. I was married at a very early age to a rich and most
respectable gentleman, but unfortunately considerably older than myself.
MATHEWS-1875-2,14.612

Ever. I have heard of such things before; MATHEWS-1875-2,14.613

but proceed.  MATHEWS-1875-2,14.614

Mat. The death of my husband has placed me in a most embarrassing
position MATHEWS-1875-2,14.615

Ever. I can believe it, poor young lady!  Poor young widow!
MATHEWS-1875-2,14.616

Fearing that I might fall into the hands of some thoughtless young
spendthrift, who would dissipate my means, he exacts that I shall marry
no one under fifty years of age.  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.621

Ever. Unheard of tyranny!  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.622

Jealousy - pure jealousy - posthumous jealousy!  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.623

MATHEWS-1875-2,15.661

$What $'s {TEXT:What's} the object of marriage?  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.662

Reciprocity.  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.663

Will the law recognise and tolerate a reciprocity, which, like that of
the Irishwoman, is only on one side?  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.664

No!  I say no!  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.665

Do away with reciprocity, what remains?  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.666

A mere cold formality, destructive of social order and the happiness
of nations.  MATHEWS-1875-2,15.667

The jealous caprice of this departed monster is a gross attack upon
the rights of the <P_16> subject, calculated to undermine the dearest
aspirations of youth, and suppress the brightest hopes of humanity.
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.668

MATHEWS-1875-2,16.672

You know the great legal dictum of Blackstone in his Commentaries.
MATHEWS-1875-2,16.673

"Like purse, like tastes, and like age, make the best marriage.
"MATHEWS-1875-2,16.674

It will, perhaps, be argued against me, that this seems to imply a
recommendation to marryage, MATHEWS-1875-2,16.675

Mat. Pray excuse my laughing, MATHEWS-1875-2,17.708

MATHEWS-1875-2,17.710

At the first glance it may appear, legally, a little out of order;
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.711

but the simple fact is that the Long Vacation is just commencing,
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.712

and a learned judge, well-known on the Northern Circuit, whose name
of course I am too delicate to disclose, gives his annual <font> bal
masque` <$$font> in honour of the holiday.  A grave and learned man in
term time, but fond of an innocent laugh once a year - only once a year
during vacation; MATHEWS-1875-2,17.713

and though quite against my usual serious habits, I am bound, as a member
of the Bar, to honour his eccentric whim, MATHEWS-1875-2,17.714

and as it is enjoined in the programme that every man shall assume the
costume most opposed to his natural character, I had selected that of
Punch, as in my case the most appropriate disguise.  MATHEWS-1875-2,17.715

Mat. Pray $do $n't {TEXT:don't} apologise, sir;
MATHEWS-1875-2,17.716

Ever. Punch was pulling the strings.  MATHEWS-1875-2,17.718

I was in earnest MATHEWS-1875-2,17.720

I throw aside the mask of folly.  MATHEWS-1875-2,17.725

Punch disappears - MATHEWS-1875-2,17.726

the barrister remains, ready to give grave and solid advice to his
fascinating client.  MATHEWS-1875-2,17.727

Mat. I believe it, sir.  MATHEWS-1875-2,17.728

And should I decide upon trying this momentous question, rest assured

Fibs.  On an errand for the Major.  MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1140

Fibs.  $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} been rather long, MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1145

stopped at all the jewellers'shops, MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1147

and was more than a quarter of an hour at her milliner's;
MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1148

No. 65, Sackville Street.  MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1150

The footman says $she $'s {TEXT:she's} a tip-top lady - right as a trivet.

A client $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} got for you, Dick.  MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1162

Nothing of the kind.  MATHEWS-1875-2,27.1168
