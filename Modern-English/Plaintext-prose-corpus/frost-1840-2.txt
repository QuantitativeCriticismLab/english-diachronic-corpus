<P_235>

At what time?  FROST-1840-2,235.2

- I should think about 11 o'clock at night.  FROST-1840-2,235.3

Did you send constables to a place called the Marshes?  FROST-1840-2,235.4

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,235.5

Were any persons brought before you in custody?  FROST-1840-2,235.6

- There were.  FROST-1840-2,235.7

Whereabouts are the Marshes, to which you sent the constables?
FROST-1840-2,235.8

- They are on the north side of the town, immediately at the northern
entrance of the town.  FROST-1840-2,235.9

Above the bridge?  FROST-1840-2,235.10

- Above the bridge.  FROST-1840-2,235.11

About how many persons were brought in custody before you in the course
of the night?  FROST-1840-2,235.12

- More than a dozen, I should think.  FROST-1840-2,235.13

By the constables?  FROST-1840-2,235.14

- By the constables.  FROST-1840-2,235.15

Were any of them detained in custody?  FROST-1840-2,235.16

- There were.  FROST-1840-2,235.17

About how many?  FROST-1840-2,235.18

- I should think as many as a dozen must have been detained in custody;
FROST-1840-2,235.19

there were more than that brought before us.  FROST-1840-2,235.20

Where were they placed?  FROST-1840-2,235.21

- The greater part of them had been sent up to the barracks;
FROST-1840-2,235.22

some of them remained in the Westgate.  FROST-1840-2,235.23

How far do you judge that the barracks are from the Westgate?
FROST-1840-2,235.24

- Somewhat less than half a mile.  FROST-1840-2,235.25

In what room in the Westgate were those that remained at the Westgate?
FROST-1840-2,235.26

- I know that there were some of them in the end room, on the east side
of the house, and in the next room to it.  FROST-1840-2,235.27

That is the room that the soldiers afterwards occupied, and the room
next to it?  FROST-1840-2,235.28

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,235.29

Did you receive any intelligence of the approach of any persons to
Newport later than that?  FROST-1840-2,235.30

- I received intelligence of the approach of persons to the town until
shortly before nine o'clock; between eight and nine o'clock in the
morning of the Monday.  FROST-1840-2,235.31

Did you hear of their approaching?  FROST-1840-2,235.32

- I did, at different points of the road.  FROST-1840-2,235.33

Did you at last send any message, or any request for troops, to the
barracks?  FROST-1840-2,235.34

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,235.35

About what hour was that?  FROST-1840-2,235.36

- It was very soon after day-break.  FROST-1840-2,235.37

In consequence of that did any military come to your assistance at
the Westgate?  FROST-1840-2,235.38

- There did.  FROST-1840-2,235.39

How many?  FROST-1840-2,235.40

- I believe there were 30; FROST-1840-2,235.41

I do not know that of my own knowledge.  FROST-1840-2,235.42

Under whose command?  FROST-1840-2,235.43

- Lieutenant Gray, now Captain Gray.  FROST-1840-2,235.44

Do you know what non-commissioned officers there were?
FROST-1840-2,235.45

- I know Serjeant Daily; FROST-1840-2,235.46

I believe the other was Serjeant Armstrong.  FROST-1840-2,235.47

There were two serjeants?  FROST-1840-2,235.48

- Two serjeants.  FROST-1840-2,235.49

<P_236>

When Lieutenant Gray arrived with the soldiers, what was done with them?
FROST-1840-2,236.51

- He first formed them in front of the house; FROST-1840-2,236.52

I then went out FROST-1840-2,236.53

and requested that he would march them into the back yard; the court-yard
of the house.  FROST-1840-2,236.54

There are gates leading into the back yard from the Westgate-street?
FROST-1840-2,236.55

- Two large doors.  FROST-1840-2,236.56

Carriage doors?  - Through which a carriage passes.  FROST-1840-2,236.57

Folding doors?  FROST-1840-2,236.58

- Yes; large folding-doors, on the east side of the house.
FROST-1840-2,236.59

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Up the yard?  FROST-1840-2,236.60

- Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> No; in front of the
street.  FROST-1840-2,236.61

Where are the gates?  FROST-1840-2,236.62

- The doors, as I call them, lead from the street into the court-yard
of the building.  FROST-1840-2,236.63

Are the gates in front of the street?  FROST-1840-2,236.64

- Yes; I returned through the house FROST-1840-2,236.65

and went into the court-yard, FROST-1840-2,236.66

and soon after I got into the court-yard, I met the military coming from
the large doors from the street into the yard; FROST-1840-2,236.67

they were formed again in the yard, FROST-1840-2,236.68

and I directed the large doors to be closed after them, which was done.
FROST-1840-2,236.69

Do you know how they were secured?  FROST-1840-2,236.70

- I believe they were fastened on the inside by means of a square piece
of iron which crosses them; FROST-1840-2,236.71

I then took Lieutenant Gray into the room, to the eastern end of the
house, FROST-1840-2,236.72

and told him that I had proposed that the soldiers should go into
that room, if he approved of it, as a proper position for them;
FROST-1840-2,236.73

he did approve of it; FROST-1840-2,236.74

but it was necessary that it should be ventilated, FROST-1840-2,236.75

and the troops were not marched into it for some little time.
FROST-1840-2,236.76

They were stationed there with Lieutenant Gray and two serjeants?
FROST-1840-2,236.77

- They were; FROST-1840-2,236.78

soon afterwards I went into the passage, FROST-1840-2,236.79

and learning that the party advancing to the town were then in the town
- FROST-1840-2,236.80

That is the passage that leads from the end room into the commercial-room
?  FROST-1840-2,236.81

- I passed through that passage into the front passage, opening to the
front door, FROST-1840-2,236.82

and then I directed the special constables, who were about the door,
to withdraw into the house, which was done; FROST-1840-2,236.83

and I directed the front door to be closed, which was also done;
FROST-1840-2,236.84

the door was afterwards opened, FROST-1840-2,236.85

and two or three special constables were put in charge of the door,
with orders to permit no one to enter.  FROST-1840-2,236.86

I then went from that passage into the room above what you call the
commercialroom, at the west end of the building; FROST-1840-2,236.87

it is a room, I believe, of the same size and of the same form, with
bow-windows, as that has.  FROST-1840-2,236.88

On the first floor?  FROST-1840-2,236.89

- On the first floor of the building; FROST-1840-2,236.90

learning that the body that was advancing was coming down the street,
at that end of the house.  FROST-1840-2,236.91

Coming down Stowe-hill?  FROST-1840-2,236.92

- Coming down Stowe-hill.  FROST-1840-2,236.93

<P_237>

Is there a view from that bow-window?  FROST-1840-2,237.95

- On the first floor there is a window similar to that marked upon the
plan, through which I could see a body of men passing the wing of the
house formed in column.  FROST-1840-2,237.96

Describe what you mean by being formed in column?  FROST-1840-2,237.97

- They were what I call a column of men, formed regularly abreast of
each other.  FROST-1840-2,237.98

Could you see whether any of them were armed?  FROST-1840-2,237.99

- Those that I noticed were all armed.  FROST-1840-2,237.100

With what weapons?  FROST-1840-2,237.101

- Some with guns and some with long spears or pikes; FROST-1840-2,237.102

I stayed a short time at the window to observe the appearance and
formation of the body, FROST-1840-2,237.103

and I then ran hastily down stairs into the passage below.
FROST-1840-2,237.104

When I got opposite the bar, which is immediately in front of the door,
I there saw the heads of what appeared to me to be a column, or a body
of men, entering the door; FROST-1840-2,237.105

I believe they were, at the instant, within the door-way,
FROST-1840-2,237.106

but if not within the door-way, they were close upon the door-way.
FROST-1840-2,237.107

That is the front porch?  FROST-1840-2,237.108

- The front porch of the house.  FROST-1840-2,237.109

In what manner were they entering the door?  FROST-1840-2,237.110

- They were standing with weapons at their sides; FROST-1840-2,237.111

I observed them with what appeared to me to be spears at their sides as
they were entering the door.  FROST-1840-2,237.112

How were the weapons carried?  FROST-1840-2,237.113

- They were carried at their side.  FROST-1840-2,237.114

Horizontally?  FROST-1840-2,237.115

- No, vertically; FROST-1840-2,237.116

I then ran forward to the room in which the soldiers were.
FROST-1840-2,237.117

Through the passage?  FROST-1840-2,237.118

- Through the passage, FROST-1840-2,237.119

and I said,"Lieutenant Gray -"FROST-1840-2,237.120

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> You need not mention what you said.
FROST-1840-2,237.121

- I gave them an order to load.  FROST-1840-2,237.122

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> That is strictly evidence?
FROST-1840-2,237.123

- Whilst the men were in the act of loading, I heard several shots fired
in the passage.  FROST-1840-2,237.124

Which passage?  FROST-1840-2,237.125

- I could not tell that from the sound; FROST-1840-2,237.126

it was one of the passages of the house.  FROST-1840-2,237.127

Inside the house?  FROST-1840-2,237.128

- Inside the house.  FROST-1840-2,237.129

Did you hear those shots before the soldiers loaded their pieces?
FROST-1840-2,237.130

- Certainly; FROST-1840-2,237.131

I also heard the windows of the room in which the soldiers were beaten
against.  FROST-1840-2,237.132

Beaten against, from where?  FROST-1840-2,237.133

- From the outside.  FROST-1840-2,237.134

What effect did that produce?  FROST-1840-2,237.135

- The lower half of each shutter was closed, FROST-1840-2,237.136

and I heard a noise against the board as if the shutters were pushed
against violently, FROST-1840-2,237.137

and the glass above was broken.  FROST-1840-2,237.138

Had the lower half of the shutters been shut when the soldiers were
first placed in the room?  FROST-1840-2,237.139

- Before they were placed in the room.  FROST-1840-2,237.140

<P_238>

Of all three windows?  FROST-1840-2,238.142

- Of all three windows.  FROST-1840-2,238.143

I perceived the soldiers could not act, on account of the lower half of
the shutters being closed.  FROST-1840-2,238.144

This was after they had loaded their pieces?  FROST-1840-2,238.145

- Immediately they had loaded their pieces.  FROST-1840-2,238.146

Did the beating against the windows continue?  FROST-1840-2,238.147

- It did.  FROST-1840-2,238.148

Had any shots been then fired against the windows?  FROST-1840-2,238.149

- I believe so; FROST-1840-2,238.150

I heard a report at least of fire-arms outside.  FROST-1840-2,238.151

What was then done with respect to the shutters?  FROST-1840-2,238.152

- I made an exclamation, FROST-1840-2,238.153

and Lieutenant Gray advanced to the shutters of the middle window,
which he opened, FROST-1840-2,238.154

and I advanced to the shutters of the side window, which I opened.
FROST-1840-2,238.155

Was that on the right or the left?  FROST-1840-2,238.156

- The shutters of the window that looked to the front of the building.
FROST-1840-2,238.157

That would be on the left?  FROST-1840-2,238.158

- On my left, nearest to the centre of the house.  FROST-1840-2,238.159

You and he approached to the window to throw the shutters open?
FROST-1840-2,238.160

- To throw the shutters open; FROST-1840-2,238.161

he, I believe, opened the middle shutter, FROST-1840-2,238.162

and I opened the shutter that I have named to you.  FROST-1840-2,238.163

What happened upon that?  FROST-1840-2,238.164

- I turned round, FROST-1840-2,238.165

and I found my hand benumbed, FROST-1840-2,238.166

and upon looking at my arm I discovered that I had been wounded,
FROST-1840-2,238.167

and upon looking down at my trousers I perceived two holes in my trousers
, FROST-1840-2,238.168

and found that I had been wounded in the hip also.  FROST-1840-2,238.169

From whence did those shots proceed?  FROST-1840-2,238.170

- From the outside.  FROST-1840-2,238.171

Did it afterwards appear with what sort of ball or slug you had been
wounded?  FROST-1840-2,238.172

- I understood the wound in my arm to have been inflicted with slugs;
FROST-1840-2,238.173

the wound in my groin or hip I understood to have been inflicted by
a ball.  FROST-1840-2,238.174

Did you see whether Serjeant Daily was wounded?  FROST-1840-2,238.175

- I saw him afterwards in the room wounded.  FROST-1840-2,238.176

Had you been wounded before the soldiers fired?  FROST-1840-2,238.177

- I had.  FROST-1840-2,238.178

I was wounded in the act of opening the window, FROST-1840-2,238.179

and I saw no soldier fire till after that time.  FROST-1840-2,238.180

Did the soldiers fire?  FROST-1840-2,238.181

- They did.  FROST-1840-2,238.182

Into the street?  FROST-1840-2,238.183

- Into the street and into the passage.  FROST-1840-2,238.184

What was the state of the passage at the time they began to fire into
the passage?  FROST-1840-2,238.185

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell you that; FROST-1840-2,238.186

at the time they began I was near the other end of the room.
FROST-1840-2,238.187

Probably you do not know what dead bodies were found in the passage?
FROST-1840-2,238.188

- No, I can only speak to one.  FROST-1840-2,238.189

Where was that dead body found?  FROST-1840-2,238.190

- He fell close to my feet.  FROST-1840-2,238.191

Were there any of the special constables or of the troops killed?
FROST-1840-2,238.192

- None killed; FROST-1840-2,238.193

there were some wounded, as I understood; FROST-1840-2,238.194

but that I only speak to from information.  FROST-1840-2,238.195

Can you judge at all how long the firing continued?  FROST-1840-2,238.196

- I should <P_239> think not quite 10 minutes; FROST-1840-2,239.197

according to my judgment it could not have been more than 10 minutes.
FROST-1840-2,239.198

Did you look into the street?  FROST-1840-2,239.199

- No, I did not.  FROST-1840-2,239.200

Nor into the passage, I suppose, till sometime afterwards?
FROST-1840-2,239.201

- I was in the passage, FROST-1840-2,239.202

and saw this person fall at my feet.  FROST-1840-2,239.203

Was it known to Lieutenant Gray that you had been wounded?
FROST-1840-2,239.204

- It was.  FROST-1840-2,239.205

Did you mention it to him at the moment?  FROST-1840-2,239.206

- Immediately afterwards.  FROST-1840-2,239.207

Was that before the firing began from the soldiers?  FROST-1840-2,239.208

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that I told him that I had been wounded
before the firing commenced.  FROST-1840-2,239.209

What had the special constables; FROST-1840-2,239.210

how were they armed?  FROST-1840-2,239.211

- With staves.  FROST-1840-2,239.212

Had any of them guns?  FROST-1840-2,239.213

- None, to my knowledge.  FROST-1840-2,239.214

Then soon after the peace of the town was restored?  FROST-1840-2,239.215

- As far as I know, FROST-1840-2,239.216

for I was obliged to give up the charge of the preservation of the peace
to other hands.  FROST-1840-2,239.217

Your wounds were severe?  FROST-1840-2,239.218

- The wound on my arm was severe, FROST-1840-2,239.219

the other was a flesh wound.  FROST-1840-2,239.220

You are suffering from the effect now of the wound in your arm?
FROST-1840-2,239.221

- I am.  FROST-1840-2,239.222

When did you leave the room in which the soldiers were?
FROST-1840-2,239.223

- Not until the affair was over.  FROST-1840-2,239.224

Who has succeeded you as mayor?  FROST-1840-2,239.225

- Mr. Thomas Hawkins.  FROST-1840-2,239.226

Had he come in before these events took place?  FROST-1840-2,239.227

- He was with me the whole of the night, giving assistance in the
direction of the special constables at the Westgate.  FROST-1840-2,239.228

What sort of a night was it; FROST-1840-2,239.229

did you go out yourself at all?  FROST-1840-2,239.230

- Yes, I did; FROST-1840-2,239.231

it was an extremely wet night, and a windy one also; FROST-1840-2,239.232

the rain fell very heavily indeed.  FROST-1840-2,239.233

Did you see any of the arms that were collected?  FROST-1840-2,239.234

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,239.235

<heading>

FROST-1840-2,239.240

FROST-1840-2,239.242

Will you produce the arms?  FROST-1840-2,239.244

- <bracket> The witness produced some pikes and staves.  <$$bracket>
FROST-1840-2,239.245

Do you know where these came from?  FROST-1840-2,239.246

- Not from my own personal knowledge; FROST-1840-2,239.247

I do not know where they were picked up.  FROST-1840-2,239.248

Are there any other arms?  FROST-1840-2,239.249

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,239.250

<bracket> The witness produced a gun, a sword, and some pikes of various
descriptions.  <$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,239.251

<P_240>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> It would be as well to
see where they come from before they are exhibited in this way.
FROST-1840-2,240.253

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> <bracket> To Sir <font>
Thomas Phillips.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Do you know any thing of these
weapons?  FROST-1840-2,240.254

- I do not of these particular weapons; FROST-1840-2,240.255

the weapons that I saw were of the same description as these.
FROST-1840-2,240.256

The weapons that you saw, where?  FROST-1840-2,240.257

- When I looked out of the window at the Westgate; there were some arms
given to Mr. Hopkins, that were taken from a man of the name of

Were the mob armed with such instruments as these?  FROST-1840-2,240.259

- The instruments that they held in their hands were like these.
FROST-1840-2,240.260

<bracket> <font> One of the weapons produced was shown to the witness.
<$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,240.261

Mr {COM:sic} <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Are you going to make these the
subject of evidence; FROST-1840-2,240.262

because, unless that is done, I object to this exhibition of them.
FROST-1840-2,240.263

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Do you know that weapon?
FROST-1840-2,240.264

- That is the weapon that was taken from a man of the name of Thomas
Davis, on the morning of Monday.  FROST-1840-2,240.265

At what hour?  FROST-1840-2,240.266

- Before day-break; FROST-1840-2,240.267

he was brought in custody by the officers.  FROST-1840-2,240.268

Is this called a mandril?  FROST-1840-2,240.269

- No, it is not a mandril.  FROST-1840-2,240.270

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Until Thomas Davis is shown to have
been with this mob or multitude, even that is not admissible evidence.
FROST-1840-2,240.271

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> When was he brought?
FROST-1840-2,240.272

- It was before day-break; FROST-1840-2,240.273

he was brought in the morning.  FROST-1840-2,240.274

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <font> Which is a mandril?
FROST-1840-2,240.275

- This is what is called a mandril - <bracket> <font> pointing it out
<$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,240.276

- it is used by the colliers in the mines in cutting coal.
FROST-1840-2,240.277

<heading>

<font> Cross-examined by Mr. Kelly.  <$$font> FROST-1840-2,240.279

<$$heading>

Will you allow me to ask you what is your business or profession?
FROST-1840-2,240.281

- I am an attorney.  FROST-1840-2,240.282

Are you in partnership with Mr. Protheroe, the gentleman who has
been sitting in court during this proceeding?  FROST-1840-2,240.283

- I was, till the close of the year that has just ceased.
FROST-1840-2,240.284

For a very great number of years?  FROST-1840-2,240.285

- From June 1824.  FROST-1840-2,240.286

Have you had any other business or calling than that of an attorney?
FROST-1840-2,240.287

- I have been interested in coal-mines, FROST-1840-2,240.288

and am still.  FROST-1840-2,240.289

I observe, in this long account which you have given of this unfortunate
transaction, that you have not once mentioned Mr. Frost's name?
FROST-1840-2,240.290

- No, I have not.  FROST-1840-2,240.291

Do you know Mr. Frost?  FROST-1840-2,240.292

- I do.  FROST-1840-2,240.293

How long have you known him?  FROST-1840-2,240.294

- For a period of 17 or 18 years.  FROST-1840-2,240.295

Were you well acquainted with him about the time when the Reform Bill
was in progress?  FROST-1840-2,240.296

- Yes, I was.  FROST-1840-2,240.297

Previously to that time had you been on good terms with him?
FROST-1840-2,240.298

- I had known very little of him, FROST-1840-2,240.299

and had had no personal intercourse with him of any kind.
FROST-1840-2,240.300

<P_241>

Had your firm - yourself and Mr. Prothero, any dealings or
transactions with him?  FROST-1840-2,241.302

- None at all.  FROST-1840-2,241.303

Do you know whether any differences had arisen between him and either
yourself or Mr. Prothero?  FROST-1840-2,241.304

- With Mr. Prothero there had.  FROST-1840-2,241.305

Did those differences continue till near about the time of the Reform
Bill?  FROST-1840-2,241.306

- I think not; FROST-1840-2,241.307

my impression is that there was an action brought by Mr. Prothero
against Mr. Frost, and two indictments against him for a libel;
FROST-1840-2,241.308

I do not know when the sentence upon the indictment was passed,
FROST-1840-2,241.309

I think in 1823 or 1824; FROST-1840-2,241.310

and for some years afterwards, I am not aware that any differences
of any kind existed between Mr. Prothero and Mr. Frost.
FROST-1840-2,241.311

Except the state of variance which such proceedings might have
occasioned, you do not know of any variance or any new proceeding?
FROST-1840-2,241.312

- None at all.  FROST-1840-2,241.313

About the time of the Reform Bill, did you yourself become more
particularly acquainted with Mr. Frost?  FROST-1840-2,241.314

- I met him in public.  FROST-1840-2,241.315

Did you meet him, among other occasions, at public meetings?
FROST-1840-2,241.316

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,241.317

Had you opportunities of observing his public conduct during that time?
FROST-1840-2,241.318

- I had.  FROST-1840-2,241.319

And afterwards?  FROST-1840-2,241.320

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,241.321

I need hardly ask you, whether at the time to which I have alluded, about
the period of the Reform Bill, there was a great deal of excitement at
Newport, as well as at other places?  FROST-1840-2,241.322

- There were public meetings held at Newport upon the subject.
FROST-1840-2,241.323

Was there a great deal of excitement?  FROST-1840-2,241.324

- There was a good deal of interest felt in the subject.
FROST-1840-2,241.325

Was there no more than interest, FROST-1840-2,241.326

was there not a very great deal of excitement at the time?
FROST-1840-2,241.327

- I should say, there was excitement, certainly.  FROST-1840-2,241.328

You say, that you yourself attended public meetings about that time?
FROST-1840-2,241.329

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,241.330

Have you attended meetings at the same time as Mr. Frost?
FROST-1840-2,241.331

- I have; FROST-1840-2,241.332

I have seen him present at meetings at which I have been present.
FROST-1840-2,241.333

And, I believe, from that time to this, Mr. Frost has taken a very
prominent part in politics and at public meetings?  FROST-1840-2,241.334

- He has.  FROST-1840-2,241.335

Have you yourself done so likewise?  FROST-1840-2,241.336

- Not very prominent.  FROST-1840-2,241.337

Did you, at the time to which I have alluded, about the time of the
Reform Bill?  FROST-1840-2,241.338

- I attended a few public meetings on two or three occasions,
FROST-1840-2,241.339

and took part in the discussions at those meetings.  FROST-1840-2,241.340

I must ask you, whether you yourself have not at public meetings, or at
a public meeting, declared, that the majority of <P_242> 37 in the House
of Lords, who had voted against the Reform Bill, deserved guillotining,
or something to that effect?  FROST-1840-2,242.341

- No, certainly not.  FROST-1840-2,242.342

You deny that?  FROST-1840-2,242.343

- Distinctly.  FROST-1840-2,242.344

Or any thing to that effect?  FROST-1840-2,242.345

- Certainly, nothing to that effect.  FROST-1840-2,242.346

Will you undertake to say that you have made no observation at all
concerning the deserts, in your estimation, of that majority of 37 in
the House of Lords?  FROST-1840-2,242.347

- I have no recollection of saying any thing at all approaching to what
you stated.  FROST-1840-2,242.348

Will you undertake to say that you have not?  FROST-1840-2,242.349

- To my recollection I have not.  FROST-1840-2,242.350

I will call the place to your recollection.  FROST-1840-2,242.351

At a meeting at the Guildhall at Usk; FROST-1840-2,242.352

did you ever attend such a meeting?  FROST-1840-2,242.353

- I did, at the county hall at Usk, at which the high sheriff presided -
a county meeting.  FROST-1840-2,242.354

We must go by steps.  FROST-1840-2,242.355

I ask you if you did not there publicly make some observation concerning
that majority in the House of Lords?  FROST-1840-2,242.356

- I may have done so.  FROST-1840-2,242.357

Did you not do so in fact?  FROST-1840-2,242.358

I ask you, upon your oath, did you not make some observation:
FROST-1840-2,242.359

we shall, by-and-by, perhaps, find what it is?  FROST-1840-2,242.360

- I believe I did.  FROST-1840-2,242.361

Concerning the majority of 37 in the House of Lords.  FROST-1840-2,242.362

Have you, now that you have had a little time to recollect yourself,
any doubt that you did?  FROST-1840-2,242.363

- I have already told you that I believe I did make some observation.
FROST-1840-2,242.364

Have you any doubt that you did?  FROST-1840-2,242.365

- I have not.  FROST-1840-2,242.366

Now, will you tell me, to the best of your recollection, what was that
observation?  FROST-1840-2,242.367

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell you.  FROST-1840-2,242.368

Did you make any observation importing what you thought that majority
deserved?  FROST-1840-2,242.369

- According to my recollection, I censured the majority,
FROST-1840-2,242.370

but as far as my recollection goes, I did it in no offensive terms
whatever.  FROST-1840-2,242.371

Did you say any thing as to what they deserved, in your opinion?
FROST-1840-2,242.372

- I do not recollect that I did; FROST-1840-2,242.373

I believe I did not.  FROST-1840-2,242.374

Or what you wished they might meet with?  FROST-1840-2,242.375

- I believe not.  FROST-1840-2,242.376

Try FROST-1840-2,242.377

and recollect yourself, whether you did not say at that meeting
something to this effect, that you wished they might meet with the fate
of certain parties in France, in allusion to the French Revolution?
FROST-1840-2,242.378

- I believe not.  FROST-1840-2,242.379

Did you make any allusion to any parties in France, as connected with
that observation?  FROST-1840-2,242.380

- I believe I alluded to what had occurred in France.
FROST-1840-2,242.381

Did you not allude to the fate of the predecessors of the present King
of the French?  FROST-1840-2,242.382

- I may have done so, FROST-1840-2,242.383

but I have no recollection whether I did or not.  FROST-1840-2,242.384

Did you not make an observation, relative to that majority of 37, in
connexion with the fate of those persons in France?  FROST-1840-2,242.385

- I have no recollection of having done any thing of the kind.
FROST-1840-2,242.386

<P_243>

Will you undertake to swear that you did not?  FROST-1840-2,243.388

- I will not undertake to swear, having no recollection on the subject.
FROST-1840-2,243.389

Did you make any observation concerning the Bishops?  FROST-1840-2,243.390

- I have no recollection.  FROST-1840-2,243.391

Were there not about that time very serious disturbances in Newport?
FROST-1840-2,243.392

- I know of none at all.  FROST-1840-2,243.393

Do you remember the period when the present Duke of Beaufort was insulted?
FROST-1840-2,243.394

- I recollect hearing that the present Duke of Beaufort, when canvassing
the town, met with some insult.  FROST-1840-2,243.395

Were there not some disturbances at Newport, at the time when the present
Duke of Beaufort was a candidate?  FROST-1840-2,243.396

- I was not a witness of any.  FROST-1840-2,243.397

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Was that at the time of
this riot?  FROST-1840-2,243.398

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> No, my Lord, at the time
of the Reform Bill.  FROST-1840-2,243.399

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> You say that you were not present at
any of those disturbances?  FROST-1840-2,243.400

- I was not.  FROST-1840-2,243.401

Were you at that time a magistrate?  FROST-1840-2,243.402

- I was not.  FROST-1840-2,243.403

Or mayor?  FROST-1840-2,243.404

- No.  FROST-1840-2,243.405

Then I understand you to say, that you have no knowledge of any
part taken by Mr. Frost at the time of those disturbances?
FROST-1840-2,243.406

- I have not.  FROST-1840-2,243.407

None at all?  FROST-1840-2,243.408

- None whatever.  FROST-1840-2,243.409

You say that you were present at public meetings where Mr.
Frost was.  FROST-1840-2,243.410

During all the time that you have had an opportunity of actually observing
his political and public conduct, was there any thing reprehensible in
it, in your judgment?  FROST-1840-2,243.411

- I frequently differed with Mr. Frost upon questions upon
which I took an opposite view, in which some heat may have been shown;
FROST-1840-2,243.412

but I was witness to nothing that, I should say, was distinctly
reprehensible.  FROST-1840-2,243.413

You have differed with him as any persons may, whose conduct is perfectly
irreproachable?  FROST-1840-2,243.414

- When I say that, my recollection is brought to a meeting in which I
certainly thought Mr. Frost acted with a good deal of want of
temper, or feeling, towards me individually.  FROST-1840-2,243.415

I am not asking you as to his temper towards an individual;
FROST-1840-2,243.416

I am asking you as to his public conduct, as far as you yourself
personally observed, FROST-1840-2,243.417

and I particularly call your attention to those times of excitement,
of which you have spoken, when you say he took a very prominent part;
FROST-1840-2,243.418

I ask whether there was any thing in his conduct tending to riot, or
other illegal proceeding?  FROST-1840-2,243.419

- I think not.  FROST-1840-2,243.420

Have you had any opportunities of observing his public conduct since he
was made a magistrate?  FROST-1840-2,243.421

- I have.  FROST-1840-2,243.422

During how many years was he a magistrate?  FROST-1840-2,243.423

- I should say three years, to my recollection, or nearly so.
FROST-1840-2,243.424

During the whole of that time was not his public conduct, as <P_244> a
magistrate, praiseworthy, as far as you had an opportunity of observing?
FROST-1840-2,244.425

- I would rather not have answered that question; FROST-1840-2,244.426

I may have found fault with Mr. Frost's public conduct as a
magistrate, FROST-1840-2,244.427

and I have done so; FROST-1840-2,244.428

but I am not prepared to say that Mr. Frost was not acting from
his belief of what was right or wrong.  FROST-1840-2,244.429

Have you ever seen any thing which you had just reason to believe was
otherwise than what he believed to be right?  FROST-1840-2,244.430

- I would rather say that I have not, certainly; that I have not
witnessed any thing but what he himself may have believed to be right.
FROST-1840-2,244.431

You have always lived in Newport, I believe?  FROST-1840-2,244.432

- Not always; FROST-1840-2,244.433

I have lived in Newport 20 years.  FROST-1840-2,244.434

Do you know that very particular inquiries were made concerning
Mr. Frost's fitness and propriety of conduct before he was
appointed a magistrate?  FROST-1840-2,244.435

- I do not.  FROST-1840-2,244.436

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> I am very unwilling to
interpose to object to any questions that may be put; FROST-1840-2,244.437

but that, I submit, is not a proper question.  FROST-1840-2,244.438

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> He has answered the question;
FROST-1840-2,244.439

he says he does not know.  FROST-1840-2,244.440

I have asked you hitherto concerning Mr. Frost's public character
; FROST-1840-2,244.441

I will now ask you, as long as you have known or heard any thing about
him, has not his private character, as a private individual and member
of a family, been perfectly good?  FROST-1840-2,244.442

- I should say not.  FROST-1840-2,244.443

As a member of a family?  FROST-1840-2,244.444

- That I know nothing of.  FROST-1840-2,244.445

It was concerning that that I asked you?  FROST-1840-2,244.446

- I understood you to ask me respecting his character as a private
individual; FROST-1840-2,244.447

I took it in two branches; FROST-1840-2,244.448

as a member of a family, I know nothing of him whatever.
FROST-1840-2,244.449

I ask you as to his character in the relations of private life with
his family?  FROST-1840-2,244.450

- I know nothing whatever of his relations in private life with his
family.  FROST-1840-2,244.451

Did you know Vincent?  FROST-1840-2,244.452

- I have seen Vincent.  FROST-1840-2,244.453

Were you present at his trial?  FROST-1840-2,244.454

- I was.  FROST-1840-2,244.455

What had you to do with his trial?  FROST-1840-2,244.456

- The trial was conducted by the magistrates; FROST-1840-2,244.457

the management of the proceedings was intrusted by the Government to
the magistrates of the borough.  FROST-1840-2,244.458

At the time you were mayor?  FROST-1840-2,244.459

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,244.460

Consequently when you were a magistrate yourself?  FROST-1840-2,244.461

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,244.462

Then, in fact, you, in your public capacity, were one of his prosecutors?
FROST-1840-2,244.463

- I was; FROST-1840-2,244.464

at least I considered the Government to be his prosecutors,
FROST-1840-2,244.465

and the magistrates were merely the local agents in conducting it by
means of their clerk.  FROST-1840-2,244.466

He was, we understand, convicted and sentenced to some term of
imprisonment?  FROST-1840-2,244.467

- He was, at the last assizes for this county.  FROST-1840-2,244.468

Do you not know that a great deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed
publicly concerning the mode in which he is supposed <P_245> to have
been treated?  FROST-1840-2,245.469

- I do not know it, except from the same sources of information that
you may.  FROST-1840-2,245.470

I am not a witness, FROST-1840-2,245.471

but you are; FROST-1840-2,245.472

do not you know that the supposed treatment of Vincent, since he has been
a prisoner, has been a subject of public complaint?  FROST-1840-2,245.473

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Do you know any thing of
it, but what you may have seen in the newspapers?  FROST-1840-2,245.474

- I do not.  FROST-1840-2,245.475

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Whatever may be his means of
information, I apprehend I am entitled to ask whether the imprisonment
of Vincent, or the supposed mode of treatment of Vincent, has not been
made a subject of public complaint - whether it was not notorious that
that was so?  FROST-1840-2,245.476

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> That is not the question
that you put; FROST-1840-2,245.477

your Question was,"whether he knew it? "FROST-1840-2,245.478

he says he only knows it by seeing it in the newspapers.
FROST-1840-2,245.479

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> That might be the very mode in which
it became publicly notorious.  FROST-1840-2,245.480

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> You must produce the newspapers.
FROST-1840-2,245.481

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> I apprehend it is not necessary to
produce the newspapers in order to show that any matter is publicly
notorious.  FROST-1840-2,245.482

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> But he knows nothing of it,
except through that medium.  FROST-1840-2,245.483

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> The witness thinks fit to answer me
in that way; FROST-1840-2,245.484

he says,"I only know it from the newspapers. "FROST-1840-2,245.485

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> It might be in various ways
; FROST-1840-2,245.486

there might be public meetings in which it was discussed;
FROST-1840-2,245.487

you may ask him that question; FROST-1840-2,245.488

but if he only know {COM:sic} it through the newspapers, he must produce
the newspapers.  FROST-1840-2,245.489

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Now attend to the form of my question
; FROST-1840-2,245.490

do you know that complaints have become public and notorious on the
subject of Vincent's supposed treatment?  FROST-1840-2,245.491

- I do not, as I have already stated, except from having seen it in a
particular paper, which is said to be edited and conducted by himself,
called the"Western Vindicator. "FROST-1840-2,245.492

Do you know whether any complaints concerning the supposed treatment
of Vincent have been the subject of discussion among the magistrates?
FROST-1840-2,245.493

- I do not.  FROST-1840-2,245.494

I believe you did not, as mayor of Newport, act with the county
magistrates?  FROST-1840-2,245.495

- I did not.  FROST-1840-2,245.496

Have there been any meetings within your own knowledge of late for the
purpose of putting down the chartists or chartism?  FROST-1840-2,245.497

- No, I know of none.  FROST-1840-2,245.498

You have attended none?  FROST-1840-2,245.499

- No, not recently.  FROST-1840-2,245.500

Within the last year?  FROST-1840-2,245.501

- I attended a public meeting at Christ-church in the spring of the year
, for the purpose of agreeing upon an address of loyalty to the Queen,
and an offer of supporting the lawful authority by enrolling ourselves,
if called upon, in an association.  FROST-1840-2,245.502

<P_246>

Had that any thing to do with the chartists or chartism?
FROST-1840-2,246.504

- The meeting was produced by the public meetings held upon the subject
of chartism.  FROST-1840-2,246.505

That meeting, then, was produced by chartism?  FROST-1840-2,246.506

- It was.  FROST-1840-2,246.507

And directed against it?  FROST-1840-2,246.508

- In so far as supporting the lawful authority might be supposed to be
directed against it.  FROST-1840-2,246.509

Were you at Newport during the whole of the 3d of November, the Sunday?
FROST-1840-2,246.510

- I was.  FROST-1840-2,246.511

At what time was it, as nearly as you remember, that you first received
any intelligence of a nature which led you to employ special constables?
FROST-1840-2,246.512

- As far back as the Thursday previously I received information that led
me to make inquiries, which ended in my giving, on Saturday, orders to
the superintendent of the police to have special constables ready; but not
for the Sunday night, but for a subsequent night, for the Tuesday night.
FROST-1840-2,246.513

You first received some information which put you on inquiries on
Thursday?  FROST-1840-2,246.514

- I received information on Thursday; FROST-1840-2,246.515

I made inquiries on Thursday; FROST-1840-2,246.516

and continued those inquiries subsequently.  FROST-1840-2,246.517

I want to know when you first actually appointed any constables?
FROST-1840-2,246.518

- Special constables had been sworn in some months ago.
FROST-1840-2,246.519

When did you, after you received this information, first appoint or put
in motion the police?  FROST-1840-2,246.520

- On the Saturday I gave instructions to the superintendent of the police.
FROST-1840-2,246.521

Where was it that any person was first, as far as you know, taken into
custody?  FROST-1840-2,246.522

- I think as early as 12 o'clock on the night of Sunday,
FROST-1840-2,246.523

but it may have been later; FROST-1840-2,246.524

I will not be positive as to the time; FROST-1840-2,246.525

it was not earlier than 12, I believe.  FROST-1840-2,246.526

Were all the persons, as they were successively taken into custody,
brought to the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-2,246.527

- They were brought to the Westgate, before Mr. Brewer, my
colleague, who was there sitting, and myself.  FROST-1840-2,246.528

Had you any opportunity of observing, after you yourself received
the wound under which you now suffer, how soon the mob dispersed?
FROST-1840-2,246.529

- I should say in about ten minutes, or perhaps less.
FROST-1840-2,246.530

In ten minutes the place was clear?  FROST-1840-2,246.531

- I will not say the place was clear.  FROST-1840-2,246.532

I understood that the street was clear in about ten minutes afterwards.
FROST-1840-2,246.533

I did not look out into the street myself.  FROST-1840-2,246.534

I do not know whether I have quite correctly taken your answer with
regard to one matter.  FROST-1840-2,246.535

You have alluded to some circumstance occurring when the present Duke
of Beaufort was a candidate.  FROST-1840-2,246.536

Do not you know, yourself, that at that very time Mr. Frost
interfered to protect him from mischief?  FROST-1840-2,246.537

- I do not.  FROST-1840-2,246.538

You do not know it at all?  FROST-1840-2,246.539

- No.  FROST-1840-2,246.540

Were you mayor at that time?  FROST-1840-2,246.541

- No.  FROST-1840-2,246.542

Nor a magistrate?  FROST-1840-2,246.543

- No.  FROST-1840-2,246.544

<P_247>

Nor present at any proceeding arising out of that?  FROST-1840-2,247.546

- None whatever.  FROST-1840-2,247.547

<$$heading>

My learned friend had inquired respecting a meeting at Usk, during the
discussions about the Reform Bill, FROST-1840-2,247.551

and you say that you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} recollect whether you made
any allusion to the French Revolution, or any observation in connexion
with the French Revolution?  FROST-1840-2,247.552

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}.  FROST-1840-2,247.553

Can you state positively whether you made any observation at all , to the
effect of that which Mr. Kelly has suggested?  FROST-1840-2,247.554

- Most distinctly not, either then or at any other time.

You are now a captain in the Queen's army?  FROST-1840-2,247.560

I believe on the 4th of November last you were a lieutenant in Her
Majesty's 46th regiment of foot?  FROST-1840-2,247.562

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,247.563

Was the company that you belonged to stationed near Newport?
FROST-1840-2,247.564

- Stationed at Newport.  FROST-1840-2,247.565

At the union poor-house, I believe?  FROST-1840-2,247.566

- At the union poor-house.  Which was converted into a barrack?
FROST-1840-2,247.567

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,247.568

One company, I believe?  FROST-1840-2,247.569

- One company.  FROST-1840-2,247.570

On the 4th of November was there any other military force in Newport?
FROST-1840-2,247.571

- None other.  FROST-1840-2,247.572

The company was commanded, I believe, by a Captain Stack?
FROST-1840-2,247.573

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,247.574

Do you remember being detached by Captain Stack on the morning of the
4th of November?  FROST-1840-2,247.575

- I was detached on the morning of the 4th of November.
FROST-1840-2,247.576

With how many men?  FROST-1840-2,247.577

- Two serjeants and 28 privates.  FROST-1840-2,247.578

To the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-2,247.579

- To the Westgate Inn.  FROST-1840-2,247.580

Did you receive orders to put yourself under the command of the mayor?
FROST-1840-2,247.581

- To report myself to the mayor.  FROST-1840-2,247.582

Did you march with your men to the Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-2,247.583

- I marched immediately with my men to the Westgate Inn,
FROST-1840-2,247.584

and reported myself to the mayor.  FROST-1840-2,247.585

As nearly as you can judge, what o'clock was it when you arrived at the
Westgate Inn?  FROST-1840-2,247.586

- I think about a quarter after eight; FROST-1840-2,247.587

I think I must have taken about eight minutes to march down.
FROST-1840-2,247.588

Will you be good enough to state to my Lords the judges and the gentlemen
of the jury what took place?  FROST-1840-2,247.589

- On my arrival at the Westgate I formed in front of the building,
FROST-1840-2,247.590

and consulted with the mayor, FROST-1840-2,247.591

and he desired me to enter the court-yard.  FROST-1840-2,247.592

<P_248>

Through the folding gates?  FROST-1840-2,248.594

- Through the stable gate.  FROST-1840-2,248.595

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> It is not necessary to go
through those details again.  FROST-1840-2,248.596

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Were you stationed in the
room with a projecting window?  FROST-1840-2,248.597

- I was stationed in the room with three projecting windows.
FROST-1840-2,248.598

A bow with three windows?  FROST-1840-2,248.599

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,248.600

Did you hear any noise from without after you had been stationed there
some time?  FROST-1840-2,248.601

- After I had made every preparation, the mayor who had left the room
returned to me, FROST-1840-2,248.602

and informed me that the mob was approaching.  FROST-1840-2,248.603

At this time were the guns of your soldiers charged?  FROST-1840-2,248.604

- They were not charged.  FROST-1840-2,248.605

Were the lower shutters of the three windows shut?  FROST-1840-2,248.606

- The lower shutters were closed.  FROST-1840-2,248.607

The mayor having entered and made a communication to you, did you yourself
hear any thing or see any thing?  FROST-1840-2,248.608

- I heard a loud cheering.  FROST-1840-2,248.609

Was that without?  FROST-1840-2,248.610

- From the angle turning up Stowe-hill, continued to the front of the
building, FROST-1840-2,248.611

and I saw by the weapons which I perceived over the half shutters,
that they were forming in front.  FROST-1840-2,248.612

Over the half shutters you could perceive weapons?  FROST-1840-2,248.613

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,248.614

What sort of weapons could you perceive?  FROST-1840-2,248.615

- Spears and pikes; FROST-1840-2,248.616

I saw they were forming in front of the building.  FROST-1840-2,248.617

Did the weapons seem to be in a line?  FROST-1840-2,248.618

- They appeared to be forming very steadily, from the manner in which
the weapons came up before the window; FROST-1840-2,248.619

they then discharged a volley of small arms at us, and at the same time
rushing through the building by the hall-door, which they had forced,
or which had been left open.  FROST-1840-2,248.620

When they fired this volley of small arms at you, what effect did that
produce upon the windows?  FROST-1840-2,248.621

- It tore the windows in different parts; FROST-1840-2,248.622

I perceive that it was caused by slugs and balls; FROST-1840-2,248.623

the window-shutters were torn by the effect of the slugs and balls
discharged at us.  FROST-1840-2,248.624

Down to that time had your men loaded their guns?  FROST-1840-2,248.625

- They were not loaded.  FROST-1840-2,248.626

Did you give any orders to your men upon that?  FROST-1840-2,248.627

- I gave the word to load immediately.  FROST-1840-2,248.628

And they did load?  FROST-1840-2,248.629

- They did load.  FROST-1840-2,248.630

With ball-cartridge?  FROST-1840-2,248.631

- With ball-cartridge.  FROST-1840-2,248.632

We understand that the lower part of the window-shutters still remained
closed?  FROST-1840-2,248.633

- They still remained closed and latched.  FROST-1840-2,248.634

What was then done with respect to the window-shutters?
FROST-1840-2,248.635

- They were then opened.  FROST-1840-2,248.636

By whom?  FROST-1840-2,248.637

- One by the mayor, and one by myself.  FROST-1840-2,248.638

<P_249>

You taking the front window, I believe?  FROST-1840-2,249.640

- I taking the one nearest to the hall; FROST-1840-2,249.641

I taking the inner window, I believe.  FROST-1840-2,249.642

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Sir Thomas Phillips represented
that he was there.  FROST-1840-2,249.643

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Did you or Sir Thomas Phillips
take the one nearest the hall?  FROST-1840-2,249.644

- I took the one nearest the centre of the building on the left hand.
FROST-1840-2,249.645

As you and Sir Thomas Phillips were opening the shutters, what happened?
FROST-1840-2,249.646

- We were then unmasked; FROST-1840-2,249.647

we were exposed to their view by the shutters being opened,
FROST-1840-2,249.648

and another volley of small arms was discharged at us.
FROST-1840-2,249.649

Did you perceive that the mayor had been wounded?  FROST-1840-2,249.650

- Not immediately; FROST-1840-2,249.651

our men commenced firing at the windows when the shutters were opened.
FROST-1840-2,249.652

When the shutters were removed, did you find that the glass had been
broken?  FROST-1840-2,249.653

- The windows had been lifted up; FROST-1840-2,249.654

the glass above was nearly all smashed.  FROST-1840-2,249.655

The lower sash had been lifted up?  FROST-1840-2,249.656

- The lower sash had been lifted up to allow as much air as possible.
FROST-1840-2,249.657

That was before the shutters were closed?  FROST-1840-2,249.658

- That was before the shutters were closed.  FROST-1840-2,249.659

Your men then fired through the windows?  FROST-1840-2,249.660

- They did; FROST-1840-2,249.661

the mob effected an entrance into the building by the hall,
FROST-1840-2,249.662

and our firing continued for about half a minute at the windows,
FROST-1840-2,249.663

and the door-way communicating with the passage of the house was secured
till the rush had subsided, and till the special constables had time to
get clear of the mob.  FROST-1840-2,249.664

Where did the special constables go to?  FROST-1840-2,249.665

- Some of them went up to the top of the building, but most of them
behind into the court-yard; FROST-1840-2,249.666

the door was then opened, FROST-1840-2,249.667

and our firing commenced into the passage.  FROST-1840-2,249.668

Did you go into the passage?  FROST-1840-2,249.669

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,249.670

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> You mean the door of the room?
FROST-1840-2,249.671

- The door of the room.  FROST-1840-2,249.672

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Communicating
with the passage that goes along the whole length of the house?
FROST-1840-2,249.673

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,249.674

What was the state of that passage when you looked into it from the door
of the room?  FROST-1840-2,249.675

- Those who had effected an entrance were passing backwards and forwards.
FROST-1840-2,249.676

Did you see whether any of them had arms?  FROST-1840-2,249.677

- Some of them had arms; every one that I saw; FROST-1840-2,249.678

there were very few that I did see.  FROST-1840-2,249.679

Your men fired into this passage?  FROST-1840-2,249.680

- Our men fired into that passage, FROST-1840-2,249.681

and soon the body of one of the mob fell across the passage, who was
killed.  FROST-1840-2,249.682

Could you at all judge how long the firing continued?
FROST-1840-2,249.683

- Less than 10 minutes, the whole affair.  FROST-1840-2,249.684

By that time were the streets cleared, and the mob dispersed?
FROST-1840-2,249.685

<P_250>

- The streets were soon cleared of all dangerous objects,
FROST-1840-2,250.687

but the attack in the inner part of the building continued to the last,
FROST-1840-2,250.688

and whenever the smoke cleared away, they attempted to force our position.
FROST-1840-2,250.689

Was that after the firing in the street had begun?  FROST-1840-2,250.690

- After the firing in the street had begun.  FROST-1840-2,250.691

In what manner did they try to force your position?  FROST-1840-2,250.692

- By attempting to rush up to the door-way; FROST-1840-2,250.693

but they always faltered when they encountered their own dead,
FROST-1840-2,250.694

and then received our fire.  FROST-1840-2,250.695

Was the passage entirely cleared within the 10 minutes?
FROST-1840-2,250.696

- Cleared of all except the dead and wounded; FROST-1840-2,250.697

I gave my men directions then to spare their ammunition.
FROST-1840-2,250.698

Was it nearly exhausted?  FROST-1840-2,250.699

- No; I averaged that they fired about three rounds per man,
FROST-1840-2,250.700

and we commenced with 22 rounds.  FROST-1840-2,250.701

Did you see any ammunition that had belonged to the mob?
FROST-1840-2,250.702

- A great deal; FROST-1840-2,250.703

we broke up some, FROST-1840-2,250.704

and applied it to our own purposes.  FROST-1840-2,250.705

Where did you see this ammunition that you say had belonged to the mob?
FROST-1840-2,250.706

- It was taken from the pockets of those who were killed.
FROST-1840-2,250.707

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Did you see it taken from the
pockets?  FROST-1840-2,250.708

- I saw it in some instances.  FROST-1840-2,250.709

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> In some instances you
yourself saw it taken from the pockets of those who were killed?
FROST-1840-2,250.710

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,250.711

What sort of ammunition was it?  FROST-1840-2,250.712

- There was one man had his ammunition made up very well; a good
description of powder, and made up like soldier's, with ball-cartridge.
FROST-1840-2,250.713

How many rounds did you find upon him?  FROST-1840-2,250.714

- I am not aware exactly; FROST-1840-2,250.715

but I dare say about 30 or 40.  FROST-1840-2,250.716

Did you see other ammunition that had belonged to them that was less
skilfully made up?  FROST-1840-2,250.717

- Yes, there was a good deal of ammunition loose.  FROST-1840-2,250.718

This one man's struck me as being particularly neatly made up.
FROST-1840-2,250.719

Did you see any slugs?  FROST-1840-2,250.720

- Slugs and balls.  FROST-1840-2,250.721

Were the slugs made up into cartridges?  FROST-1840-2,250.722

- No, they were not; FROST-1840-2,250.723

they were loose.  FROST-1840-2,250.724

How was the powder that was not made up into cartridges;
FROST-1840-2,250.725

was that in flasks?  FROST-1840-2,250.726

- We took some flasks.  FROST-1840-2,250.727

What were the slugs contained in?  FROST-1840-2,250.728

- Loose, as well as I remember.  FROST-1840-2,250.729

Loose in their pockets?  FROST-1840-2,250.730

- Loose in their pockets.  FROST-1840-2,250.731

Were the pieces of your men charged with any of that ammunition?
FROST-1840-2,250.732

- No; we loaded for four days afterwards, FROST-1840-2,250.733

and we required perpetual priming.  FROST-1840-2,250.734

You afterwards applied it?  FROST-1840-2,250.735

- We afterwards applied it; not then.  FROST-1840-2,250.736

In the course of this Monday morning did you find any persons <P_251>
in the Westgate Inn that had belonged to the mob?  FROST-1840-2,251.737

- There were two prisoners taken in the building that had belonged to
the mob.  FROST-1840-2,251.738

Were you present when they were taken?  FROST-1840-2,251.739

- I was present when they were taken.  FROST-1840-2,251.740

Where were they?  FROST-1840-2,251.741

- As well as I remember, they were in a side room connected with the
passage.  FROST-1840-2,251.742

Near the room where you were stationed?  FROST-1840-2,251.743

- Within about 10 paces.  FROST-1840-2,251.744

Had they got any arms with them?  FROST-1840-2,251.745

- I saw no arms in their hands.  FROST-1840-2,251.746

I gave them up to the soldiers, FROST-1840-2,251.747

and ordered them to be examined, FROST-1840-2,251.748

and ammunition was taken from one of them.  FROST-1840-2,251.749

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Was that in your presence?
FROST-1840-2,251.750

- It was in my presence; FROST-1840-2,251.751

I was standing over them.  FROST-1840-2,251.752

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Then the mob had dispersed
, FROST-1840-2,251.753

and the streets were empty?  FROST-1840-2,251.754

- The mob had dispersed; FROST-1840-2,251.755

there were some here and there, but without arms.  FROST-1840-2,251.756

Do you know how many dead bodies were found?  FROST-1840-2,251.757

- We found nine.  FROST-1840-2,251.758

How many of your men were in the room?  FROST-1840-2,251.762

- They were all there; FROST-1840-2,251.763

there were in the whole 30 under my orders.  FROST-1840-2,251.764

You were proceeding to tell us in what way you disposed of the men when
you first came, and what you did afterwards, when my learned friend
interrupted you with a question.  FROST-1840-2,251.765

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> The Court intimated that I
need not go over again what the mayor had detailed.  FROST-1840-2,251.766

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I want to know what the fact was;
FROST-1840-2,251.767

you say you first drew the men up before the inn; FROST-1840-2,251.768

where did you go to next?  FROST-1840-2,251.769

- To the court-yard.  FROST-1840-2,251.770

How long did you stay in front of the inn?  FROST-1840-2,251.771

- About a minute.  FROST-1840-2,251.772

And then you went into the court-yard?  FROST-1840-2,251.773

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,251.774

How long did you stay there?  FROST-1840-2,251.775

- About ten minutes.  FROST-1840-2,251.776

Where did you go then?  FROST-1840-2,251.777

- I then entered the building FROST-1840-2,251.778

and occupied the room on the right flank of the building.
FROST-1840-2,251.779

The room where the firing took place?  FROST-1840-2,251.780

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,251.781

How long did you stay there before you received the order to load?
FROST-1840-2,251.782

- I received no orders to load.  FROST-1840-2,251.783

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> What he said was, that he
gave orders to load.  FROST-1840-2,251.784

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I understood Sir Thomas Phillips
to say, that he ordered them to load.  FROST-1840-2,251.785

Did Sir Thomas Phillips give you any orders to load?  FROST-1840-2,251.786

- I do not remember receiving any orders to load.  FROST-1840-2,251.787

What did he give you orders to do?  FROST-1840-2,251.788

- We consulted together, FROST-1840-2,251.789

and as it was the expectation that the mob would attack us in the building
, he was anxious that I should enter it; FROST-1840-2,251.790

he <P_252> offered me this room, which, on examination, I found capable
of answering for the purpose very well, as it was on the ground floor, and
as it communicated with the steps and with the house; FROST-1840-2,252.791

I brought my men there; FROST-1840-2,252.792

I did not load, because there was no immediate necessity;
FROST-1840-2,252.793

it is a point upon which I am the only judge.  FROST-1840-2,252.794

You say you were about a minute in front of the building, and then 10
minutes in the court-yard?  FROST-1840-2,252.795

- About 10 minutes in the court-yard.  FROST-1840-2,252.796

And then you went into the building, FROST-1840-2,252.797

and went to this room, which you and Sir Thomas Phillips agreed was a
fit position for you to occupy?  FROST-1840-2,252.798

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,252.799

You say you did not receive any orders to load, FROST-1840-2,252.800

but you loaded because you thought the time was come when it was necessary
to do so?  FROST-1840-2,252.801

- I loaded when I was fired on; FROST-1840-2,252.802

I required no orders to load; FROST-1840-2,252.803

I had not time to look for instructions, FROST-1840-2,252.804

and there was no necessity for it.  FROST-1840-2,252.805

Were you fired on the moment the shutters were opened?
FROST-1840-2,252.806

- The moment the shutters were opened, that served to expose us,
FROST-1840-2,252.807

and we received a fresh volley.  FROST-1840-2,252.808

Had you been fired on before?  FROST-1840-2,252.809

- We were fired on when the mob came in front of the building.
FROST-1840-2,252.810

Before the shutters were opened?  FROST-1840-2,252.811

- Before the shutters were opened.  FROST-1840-2,252.812

Did you then give orders to load?  FROST-1840-2,252.813

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,252.814

The shutters were opened for the purpose of giving effect to your fire
upon the mob?  FROST-1840-2,252.815

- To allow our men to fire; FROST-1840-2,252.816

the shutters were about a foot higher than the men, FROST-1840-2,252.817

and unless the shutters were opened the soldiers could not fire.
FROST-1840-2,252.818

Unless they fired in the air?  FROST-1840-2,252.819

- Soldiers do not do that.  FROST-1840-2,252.820

But many shots came in over the glass?  FROST-1840-2,252.821

- Yes, a great many.  FROST-1840-2,252.822

Many of the shots were in the ceiling?  FROST-1840-2,252.823

- Many in the ceiling.  FROST-1840-2,252.824

Then the practice of the mob was different from that of the military,
FROST-1840-2,252.825

and all the damage they did was to break the windows and to make a hole
in the ceiling?  FROST-1840-2,252.826

- And to tear the shutters, and to wound one of our party, and Sir
Thomas Phillips.  FROST-1840-2,252.827

That was not until after the shutters were opened?  FROST-1840-2,252.828

- No.  FROST-1840-2,252.829

Do not mix matters together that I am endeavouring to keep separate;
FROST-1840-2,252.830

what I want to know distinctly is, whether you did not load for the
purpose of firing before you opened the shutters?  FROST-1840-2,252.831

- I loaded for the purpose of firing before I opened the shutters.
FROST-1840-2,252.832

You say you expended about three rounds of ball-cartridge?
FROST-1840-2,252.833

- I averaged it at about three rounds per man.  FROST-1840-2,252.834

How long were you in that room before the firing over the shutters into
the ceiling commenced?  FROST-1840-2,252.835

- Something better than five minutes.  FROST-1840-2,252.836

<P_253>

<heading>

<font> Re-examined by Mr. Attorney-general.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-2,253.839

<$$heading>

Before you opened the shutters, had there been firing against the
shutters?  FROST-1840-2,253.841

- There had been firing against the shutters, and through the shutters.
FROST-1840-2,253.842

Were the shutters damaged by that firing before you opened the shutters?
FROST-1840-2,253.843

- The shutters were damaged and torn by that firing before I opened
the shutters.  FROST-1840-2,253.844

Could you see whether the shot marks were on a level with you?
FROST-1840-2,253.845

- Perfectly on a level with us, FROST-1840-2,253.846

but the shutters protected us in a great measure.  FROST-1840-2,253.847

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> What was on a level with him,
the marks in the shutters?  FROST-1840-2,253.848

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord.
FROST-1840-2,253.849

Could you tell whether the balls in the ceiling had glanced against
the shutters?  FROST-1840-2,253.850

- Very likely they might have done so.  FROST-1840-2,253.851

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> That was not the question;
FROST-1840-2,253.852

you were asked not whether it was likely, but whether you could tell?
FROST-1840-2,253.853

- I could not tell.  FROST-1840-2,253.854

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> If they had glanced against
the shutters, might that have taken them up into the ceiling where you
saw them?  FROST-1840-2,253.855

- We can never account for how a ball goes; FROST-1840-2,253.856

it takes all directions.  FROST-1840-2,253.857

But independently of the balls that went into the ceiling, can you say
whether, before you opened the shutters, the balls struck the shutters
on a level with you?  FROST-1840-2,253.858

- The balls struck the shutters on a level with me; FROST-1840-2,253.859

the other balls in the ceiling I did not remark till after the whole
attack; FROST-1840-2,253.860

but those I perceived the very moment they occurred.  FROST-1840-2,253.861

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> Did the mob fire at the military
after the military were completely unmasked?  FROST-1840-2,253.862

- They fired a volley on us the moment we opened the shutters;
FROST-1840-2,253.863

and they might have fired a great deal more, FROST-1840-2,253.864

but our fire commanded theirs, FROST-1840-2,253.865

and the din and noise was so great that I could not tell what they did,
except from a knowledge of the wounds we received.  FROST-1840-2,253.866

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> My Lord, that seems to me a very
important point, FROST-1840-2,253.867

and the answer we have received is hardly a satisfactory one;
FROST-1840-2,253.868

will your Lordship have the goodness to put the question to the witness in
the way you think best, whether the mob fired upon the military after they
knew the military were in this room, after they had exposed themselves.
FROST-1840-2,253.869

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He says that the mayor
and Serjeant Daily were wounded after the shutters were thrown up.
FROST-1840-2,253.870

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> This difficulty suggests itself
to my mind - whether those wounds might not have been received by
the continuous random firing of the mob previous to the unmasking.
FROST-1840-2,253.871

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Do you mean before the
shutters were thrown up?  FROST-1840-2,253.872

<P_254>

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> Yes, my Lord.  FROST-1840-2,254.874

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> You want to know whether
they continued firing after they knew the military were in the room?
FROST-1840-2,254.875

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> That is the point I want to have
ascertained.  FROST-1840-2,254.876

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The gentlemen of the jury
want to know, whether you mean to say, that the mob deliberately fired
upon the military, after they knew you were there, when the shutters
were opened?  FROST-1840-2,254.877

- I have no reason to suspect otherwise; FROST-1840-2,254.878

the mob fired deliberately upon us when they saw us unmasked;
FROST-1840-2,254.879

I was prepared for it, FROST-1840-2,254.880

and as I was prepared, they did so.  FROST-1840-2,254.881

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Are you satisfied that the mob
saw you at the time they fired the volley upon you?  FROST-1840-2,254.882

- I am satisfied they must have seen me.  FROST-1840-2,254.883

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> That is what I wanted to know.
FROST-1840-2,254.884

- <font> Witness.  <$$font> The windows extended to the very floor,
FROST-1840-2,254.885

and I was exposed, every part of me.  FROST-1840-2,254.886

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> In your uniform?
FROST-1840-2,254.887

- In my uniform.  FROST-1840-2,254.888

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Did they see soldiers beside you?
FROST-1840-2,254.889

- The soldiers were in a line behind me.  FROST-1840-2,254.890

Can you state to a certainty, whether the mob must have seen the soldiers
, at the time they fired, as well as yourself?  FROST-1840-2,254.891

- They must have seen the soldiers as well as myself.
FROST-1840-2,254.892

Did the windows go down to the ground?  FROST-1840-2,254.893

- They extended to the very floor of the house, all but a few inches.
FROST-1840-2,254.894

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> That is what you wanted,
is it?  FROST-1840-2,254.895

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> It is, my Lord.
FROST-1840-2,254.896

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Will your Lordship have the goodness
to ask the witness this question: FROST-1840-2,254.897

after the shutters were taken down, when he supposes they were unmasked
, how many soldiers out of the 30 in the room received any wound?
FROST-1840-2,254.898

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> You hear the question,
Captain Gray; FROST-1840-2,254.899

how many soldiers out of the 30 in the room received any wound after
the shutters were opened?  FROST-1840-2,254.900

- Only one.  FROST-1840-2,254.901

Was that Serjeant Daily?  FROST-1840-2,254.902

- Serjeant Daily.  FROST-1840-2,254.903

Did the mayor receive his wound after that time?  FROST-1840-2,254.904

- The mayor received a wound at the same time.  FROST-1840-2,254.905

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I hope your Lordship will pursue
this inquiry; FROST-1840-2,254.906

the mayor said, that he received his wound simultaneously.
FROST-1840-2,254.907

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Any question that you can
suggest, the Court will put.  FROST-1840-2,254.908

<heading>

<font> Serjeant James Daily was called.  <$$font> FROST-1840-2,254.910

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, Serjeant Daily is
described thus,"A Serjeant in Her Majesty's 45th regiment of foot,
abiding at the barracks at Pillgwenlly, in the parish of St.
Woollos, in the <P_255> borough of Newport, in the county of Monmouth.
"FROST-1840-2,255.912

I propose to examine him, my Lord, on the <font> voir dire.  <$$font>
FROST-1840-2,255.913

<bracket> <font> The witness was sworn upon the <$$font> voir dire.
<$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,255.914

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I wish to know which of these
two is the correct description of you:"James Daily, a serjeant in Her
Majesty's 45th regiment of foot, abiding at the Newport poor-house;
"or"James Daily, a serjeant in Her Majesty's 45th regiment of foot,
abiding at the barrack at Pillgwenlly? "FROST-1840-2,255.915

- At the poor-house.  FROST-1840-2,255.916

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> We had a second list sent with
that alteration.  FROST-1840-2,255.917

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Where has your company
been stationed for some time past?  FROST-1840-2,255.918

- They have been stationed, ever since they arrived at Newport, at the
union poor-house.  FROST-1840-2,255.919

How long is it since they arrived at Newport?  FROST-1840-2,255.920

- I am not certain of the date; FROST-1840-2,255.921

more than three months.  FROST-1840-2,255.922

How has that union poor-house been fitted up for your reception?
FROST-1840-2,255.923

- It has been fitted up in temporary order as a barrack-room.
FROST-1840-2,255.924

Have the whole company been stationed there?  FROST-1840-2,255.925

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,255.926

Are there any other barracks besides where your company is stationed?
FROST-1840-2,255.927

- Our company are stationed all together.  FROST-1840-2,255.928

Are there any others in Newport?  FROST-1840-2,255.929

- The company that I belong to are stationed at the poor-house barracks
, FROST-1840-2,255.930

and have been so ever since they arrived at Newport.  FROST-1840-2,255.931

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> There is no objection as
to this being in the parish of St. Woollos.  FROST-1840-2,255.932

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> None at all.  FROST-1840-2,255.933

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It is not disputed that
this is in the parish of St. Woollos, in the borough of Newport.
FROST-1840-2,255.934

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Is this called Pill?
FROST-1840-2,255.935

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Is this district called
Pill, or Pillgwenlly?  FROST-1840-2,255.936

- I am not certain.  FROST-1840-2,255.937

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> It is called Pillgwenlly
in the printed list, FROST-1840-2,255.938

and the boy proved that Pillgwenlly was called Pill.  FROST-1840-2,255.939

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Is this barrack in Pillgwenlly?
FROST-1840-2,255.940

- Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> No.  FROST-1840-2,255.941

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It appeared to me that it was
on the other side of the town.  FROST-1840-2,255.942

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> It is not quite on the other
side of the town, FROST-1840-2,255.943

but it is a long way beyond the Court-y-bella machine-house.
FROST-1840-2,255.944

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> You must ask somebody who
is acquainted with the situation of Pillgwenlly.  FROST-1840-2,255.945

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Where is it that your
company is stationed?  FROST-1840-2,255.946

- It is stationed at the poor-house, at the top of Stowe-hill.
FROST-1840-2,255.947

The whole company is stationed there?  FROST-1840-2,255.948

- The whole company.  FROST-1840-2,255.949

Do you know Pillgwenlly?  FROST-1840-2,255.950

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,255.951

<P_256>

Do you know how far Pillgwenlly extends?  FROST-1840-2,256.953

- I do not.  FROST-1840-2,256.954

Are there any barracks at Pillgwenlly?  FROST-1840-2,256.955

- There have been barracks fitted up there for a part of our regiment
that arrived there after the riot at Newport, where the mill formerly was.
FROST-1840-2,256.956

Were you ever stationed at those barracks?  FROST-1840-2,256.957

- Never.  FROST-1840-2,256.958

How far are those barracks from the poor-house?  FROST-1840-2,256.959

- Near about a mile.  FROST-1840-2,256.960

Are they all in the parish of St. Woollos?  FROST-1840-2,256.961

- I do not know.  FROST-1840-2,256.962

Where was Lieutenant Gray quartered?  FROST-1840-2,256.963

- He was quartered in Newport.  FROST-1840-2,256.964

Where was he quartered on the 4th of November?  FROST-1840-2,256.965

- He was quartered in the town of Newport.  FROST-1840-2,256.966

He had lodgings there?  FROST-1840-2,256.967

- He had lodgings there.  FROST-1840-2,256.968

On the 4th of November, were there any men of your company at Newport,
except those that were in the poor-house?  FROST-1840-2,256.969

- There was a party ordered down to go to the Westgate Inn, 28 privates
and two serjeants, under Lieutenant Gray.  FROST-1840-2,256.970

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I am afraid I must stop
this, or I shall be supposed not to be objecting to the witness.
FROST-1840-2,256.971

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> We are still upon the <font>
voir dire.  <$$font> FROST-1840-2,256.972

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> At present, it seems that
there is a description given of the barracks as being at Pillgwenlly;
FROST-1840-2,256.973

and it would seem from this witness's evidence that there is not
only the place called the union poor-house, in which the troops
have been quartered, but that some of this very regiment have been
quartered in a place which was fitted up as barracks at Pillgwenlly.
FROST-1840-2,256.974

Therefore, this description was rather calculated to mislead, because
it says that they ought to find him at Pillgwenlly, whereas, in fact,
they ought to find him at the other place.  FROST-1840-2,256.975

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It seems to come to this,
that at the time when the notice was given, which is the time we are to
look to, there was a barrack in the union poor-house, FROST-1840-2,256.976

and there appears likewise to have been a barrack at Pillgwenlly;
FROST-1840-2,256.977

now, the witness, it would appear, was of that division stationed
in the poor-house, and not of that stationed at Pillgwenlly.
FROST-1840-2,256.978

Those are the facts; FROST-1840-2,256.979

but both the barracks are in the parish of St. Woollos and in
the borough of Monmouth.  FROST-1840-2,256.980

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> He was not abiding in the
barracks at Pillgwenlly.  FROST-1840-2,256.981

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> And this description sent
them there to look for him.  FROST-1840-2,256.982

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> He was not abiding at the
barracks at Pillgwenlly, FROST-1840-2,256.983

he was stationed at the union poor-house.  FROST-1840-2,256.984

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> It is over particular.
FROST-1840-2,256.985

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> Then it will come to this,
whether that over particularity may or may not be rejected, because, if
it may, there is enough here, because he is described as of the <P_257>
45th regiment,"in the parish of St. Woollos, in the borough of
Newport. "FROST-1840-2,257.986

But if your Lordship thinks, as this particular description is erroneous ,
that is a sufficient objection, the moment your Lordship intimates that,
of course I withdraw the witness.  FROST-1840-2,257.987

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> I think the over-particularity
might mislead.  FROST-1840-2,257.988

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> That is quite enough.
FROST-1840-2,257.989

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> The description is inaccurate.

Examined by Mr. Wightman.  <$$font> FROST-1840-2,257.993

<$$heading>

Where do you live?  FROST-1840-2,257.995

- At Newport.  FROST-1840-2,257.996

Do you remember the Sunday evening, the 3d of November last?
FROST-1840-2,257.997

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,257.998

Were you a special constable?  FROST-1840-2,257.999

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,257.1000

Did you go out on that evening towards the hills?  FROST-1840-2,257.1001

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-2,257.1002

By whose orders did you go out?  FROST-1840-2,257.1003

- The mayor's.  FROST-1840-2,257.1004

Sir Thomas Phillips?  FROST-1840-2,257.1005

- Sir Thomas Phillips.  FROST-1840-2,257.1006

At what time in the evening did you set off?  FROST-1840-2,257.1007

- Ten o'clock.  FROST-1840-2,257.1008

Had you gone out before that, FROST-1840-2,257.1009

or was that the first time?  FROST-1840-2,257.1010

- That was the first time.  FROST-1840-2,257.1011

Were you on horseback?  FROST-1840-2,257.1012

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,257.1013

What road did you take?  FROST-1840-2,257.1014

- Towards Risca.  FROST-1840-2,257.1015

Did any one go with you?  FROST-1840-2,257.1016

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,257.1017

Who was he?  FROST-1840-2,257.1018

- A man named Richard Webb.  FROST-1840-2,257.1019

On your road to Risca did you meet any persons?  FROST-1840-2,257.1020

- I went through a party standing on the roadside.  FROST-1840-2,257.1021

How far were you from Newport when you went through that party of men?
FROST-1840-2,257.1022

- Three miles and a half.  FROST-1840-2,257.1023

Is there any name to the place where you saw those men?
FROST-1840-2,257.1024

- Rigby's, they call it.  FROST-1840-2,257.1025

How many men were there?  FROST-1840-2,257.1026

- There may have been a dozen or two.  FROST-1840-2,257.1027

What were they doing?  FROST-1840-2,257.1028

- Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I do not see how my learned
friend can make this evidence.  FROST-1840-2,257.1029

There is no connexion whatever between the prisoner at the bar and
this transaction.  FROST-1840-2,257.1030

For any thing that has been even opened, certainly for any thing
that has been proved, or that appears likely to be proved, this may
have been a mere insulated matter, possibly a matter of accident.
FROST-1840-2,257.1031

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> At present he has proved nothing
that is material, FROST-1840-2,257.1032

and I do not see how we can reject the evidence.  FROST-1840-2,257.1033

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> The question is as to the number
of persons collected together.  FROST-1840-2,257.1034

It may be very immaterial, FROST-1840-2,257.1035

but, recollecting what use is sometimes made of evidence, I do not
like to <P_258> see a number of immaterial things collected together,
for the purpose of being used in argument hereafter, for purposes of
which I am ignorant.  FROST-1840-2,258.1036

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> It is in evidence, that
in the course of that night this man was sent out from Newport, for
the purpose of making inquiry as to what the state of the country was,
at a time shortly preceding the arrival of these persons at Newport.
FROST-1840-2,258.1037

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} stop that.  FROST-1840-2,258.1038

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Suppose the answer to the next
question was, that the men were armed, FROST-1840-2,258.1039

you could not say that was immaterial?  FROST-1840-2,258.1040

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Perhaps your Lordship has not adverted
to the second branch of the question, which is,"What were they doing?
"FROST-1840-2,258.1041

Suppose they were committing murder?  FROST-1840-2,258.1042

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It may turn out that the answer
may make the question wholly irrelevant; FROST-1840-2,258.1043

it may make it relevant.  FROST-1840-2,258.1044

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> It may turn out so;
FROST-1840-2,258.1045

but it is for the purpose of preventing an irrelevant answer that we
object to the question.  FROST-1840-2,258.1046

We say that, at present, the acts of the twelve men, or whatever the
number were, who were assembled on the Sunday evening at the time
alluded to by the witness - that those acts, whatever they may have
been, are not evidence against the prisoner at the bar, unless he is
proved to have been present, and unless he is, by previous evidence,
directly connected with them.  FROST-1840-2,258.1047

I quite agree that, so far as your Lordships'minds are concerned
, whatever the answer may be, it is altogether immaterial;
FROST-1840-2,258.1048

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} admit that it is so, considering the
other part of the tribunal before which this cause is conducted.
FROST-1840-2,258.1049

Who shall say what is to be the effect in a long trial lasting several
days, of any acts given in evidence, by a body of men, upon the minds
of the jury?  FROST-1840-2,258.1050

It may be calculated to produce a very serious effect upon their minds
, though your Lordships may afterwards consider that it has no bearing
upon the case at all; FROST-1840-2,258.1051

I apprehend in a case of this kind it is necessary to connect individuals
who are supposed to have done any acts whatever with the prisoner at
the bar, before those acts can be given in evidence; FROST-1840-2,258.1052

and, therefore, I object to the question as to what those twelve men on
the Sunday evening were doing.  FROST-1840-2,258.1053

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Let us hear in what direction
this was.  FROST-1840-2,258.1054

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> He said that he went in
the direction of Risca.  FROST-1840-2,258.1055

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Is that in the direction
from which, on the following morning, those persons came to Newport?
FROST-1840-2,258.1056

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It is.
FROST-1840-2,258.1057

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> Ask that question.
FROST-1840-2,258.1058

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Is that the road to the hills
from Newport?  FROST-1840-2,258.1059

- It is.  FROST-1840-2,258.1060

<P_259>

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It comes by Court-y-bella.
FROST-1840-2,259.1062

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Is it beyond Court-y-bella?
FROST-1840-2,259.1063

- It is.  FROST-1840-2,259.1064

Is it upon the high road?  FROST-1840-2,259.1065

- It is upon the same tram-road.  FROST-1840-2,259.1066

Does Court-y-bella stand between Risca and Newport?  FROST-1840-2,259.1067

- By the tram-road it does.  FROST-1840-2,259.1068

Do you know the Cefn?  FROST-1840-2,259.1069

- I do.  FROST-1840-2,259.1070

Is the Cefn upon the road between Newport and Risca?
FROST-1840-2,259.1071

- Yes, it is.  FROST-1840-2,259.1072

Do you know a place called the Welch Oak?  FROST-1840-2,259.1073

- Yes, I do.  FROST-1840-2,259.1074

Is that between Risca and Cefn?  FROST-1840-2,259.1075

- Yes, it is.  FROST-1840-2,259.1076

Does the tram-road, of which you have been speaking, pass by Tredegar
Park?  FROST-1840-2,259.1077

- It does; FROST-1840-2,259.1078

it goes through Tredegar Park.  FROST-1840-2,259.1079

You saw 12 persons or more, you say, on the road; FROST-1840-2,259.1080

I want to know what they were doing?  FROST-1840-2,259.1081

- Standing under a wall.  FROST-1840-2,259.1082

Did you see whether they had any thing in their hands or not?
FROST-1840-2,259.1083

- I could not see so plain as that; FROST-1840-2,259.1084

it was dark.  FROST-1840-2,259.1085

Did you pass on?  FROST-1840-2,259.1086

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,259.1087

Did you go by the Cefn?  FROST-1840-2,259.1088

- I had passed the Cefn then.  FROST-1840-2,259.1089

Did you go on to the Welch Oak?  FROST-1840-2,259.1090

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,259.1091

Did you pass that?  FROST-1840-2,259.1092

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,259.1093

Did you get on as far as Risca?  FROST-1840-2,259.1094

- Yes, I went very near Risca.  FROST-1840-2,259.1095

When you got near Risca, did you hear any thing?  FROST-1840-2,259.1096

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> My Lord, I object to that
question.  FROST-1840-2,259.1097

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> We are not going to ask
as to conversations; FROST-1840-2,259.1098

we will vary the form of the question.  FROST-1840-2,259.1099

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Did you hear any noise, any sound?
FROST-1840-2,259.1100

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> It is the anxiety to avoid
a leading question that induces my learned friend to put it in that shape.
FROST-1840-2,259.1101

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I attended to my learned friend's
opening, FROST-1840-2,259.1102

and I must be quite aware of what this is, FROST-1840-2,259.1103

and of course I am anxious to shut out that which I feel, upon the
authority that I hold in my hand, is not evidence against Mr.
Frost.  FROST-1840-2,259.1104

I am not capable of doing much more than referring to the authority.
FROST-1840-2,259.1105

It is a case in Roscoe's Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases,
page 59.  FROST-1840-2,259.1106

"Similar evidence was lately admitted in a case of robbery.
FROST-1840-2,259.1107

The prisoner came with a mob to the prosecutor's house,
FROST-1840-2,259.1108

and one of the mob went up to the prosecutor, FROST-1840-2,259.1109

and civilly, and, as he believed, with a good intention, advised
him to give them something to get rid of them, which he did.
FROST-1840-2,259.1110

To show that this was not <font> bona` fide <$$font> advice to the
prosecutor, but in reality a mode of robbing him, it was proposed to give
evidence of other demands of money made by the same mob at other houses
at different periods of the day, when some of the prisoners were present.
FROST-1840-2,259.1111

Parke, Justice, having conferred with Vaughan, Baron, and Alderson ,
said,'We are of opinion that what was done by the mob before and after
the particular transaction at the prosecutor's <P_260> house, but in
the course of the same day, and when any of the prisoners were present,
may be given in evidence. '"FROST-1840-2,260.1112

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> That was upon the special
commission at Winchester.  FROST-1840-2,260.1113

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> That was an indictment for
a robbery.  FROST-1840-2,260.1114

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> The mob went about the country
robbing different people.  FROST-1840-2,260.1115

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> And there the acts of the
mob elsewhere were not allowed to be given in evidence with a view
of showing their intention, unless they could show that some of the
prisoners were present.  FROST-1840-2,260.1116

This is not an indictment against Mr. Frost for conspiracy.
FROST-1840-2,260.1117

But suppose it were an indictment for a conspiracy, where you may
almost prove any thing, and then apply the evidence afterwards;
FROST-1840-2,260.1118

still, even in that case, where a number of persons are indicted
for conspiracy, if you propose to give any evidence against any body,
however little it may affect the person immediately under trial, you must
show that it immediately affects somebody concerned in the conspiracy.
FROST-1840-2,260.1119

Now here a certain number of persons are supposed to be standing under
a wall; FROST-1840-2,260.1120

the night is so dark that it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be seen whether
they had any thing in their hands, FROST-1840-2,260.1121

and it is supposed FROST-1840-2,260.1122

<paren> for one must not disguise the fact; FROST-1840-2,260.1123

it is in that way only I can argue it <$$paren>, FROST-1840-2,260.1124

it is supposed, that because somebody fired a shot by which the witness
was wounded, that that may be legitimately given in evidence against
Mr. Frost; as if no shot could be fired that night in any direction
towards the hills, without Mr. Frost having some connexion with it;
and this without any evidence whatever that any one of the parties present
at the firing of that gun was connected at all with Mr. Frost,
or was a person with whom Mr. Frost had had any communication.
FROST-1840-2,260.1125

Any thing of that sort might have happened; FROST-1840-2,260.1126

in short, any damage might have been done by any body -
FROST-1840-2,260.1127

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> That is not what I am going to
ask him about at present.  FROST-1840-2,260.1128

Mr. Justice <font> Williams.  <$$font> The question was not as
to a shot, but as to a sound.  FROST-1840-2,260.1129

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I believe that the sound
was the sound of a pistol, and that then he found himself wounded.
FROST-1840-2,260.1130

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> No; you had better wait till you
hear the answer.  FROST-1840-2,260.1131

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> I think you $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} object to the question, because a legitimate answer may
be given to it; FROST-1840-2,260.1132

suppose the answer was that he saw a number of men there armed, or a
number of men being drilled, FROST-1840-2,260.1133

why, this is the very quarter from which the party came the following
morning, FROST-1840-2,260.1134

and that would be legitimate evidence.  FROST-1840-2,260.1135

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> As it does not appear that either
Mr. Frost, the <P_261> prisoner, was present, or that any one of
the persons who composed the multitude of the 4th of November was present;
but for aught that appears to the contrary, this may have been a body
of men totally distinct from and unknown to every one of the individuals
composing the multitude of the 4th of November, and totally unconnected
with and unknown to Mr. Frost; FROST-1840-2,261.1136

I beg to ask upon what principle at all authorized by law can any thing
said or done by these people be evidence against Mr. Frost?
FROST-1840-2,261.1137

In order to show the danger of this evidence until Mr. Frost or
some of the mob of which he is supposed to have been a member on the 4th
of November are connected with this particular meeting of persons , let
me just suppose this, that in answer to the question put by my learned
friend as to what he heard, the witness were to answer, that he heard
one of them say,"We are marching to London for the purpose of deposing
the Queen,"FROST-1840-2,261.1138

is it to be pretended that a declaration of that kind -
FROST-1840-2,261.1139

<paren> for a declaration in a matter of high treason is an act done,
FROST-1840-2,261.1140

it is evidence of a compassing, FROST-1840-2,261.1141

and would be an overt act <$$paren> - FROST-1840-2,261.1142

is it to be pretended that an act of that kind, or indeed any act done
by any body of persons not proved to have been even known to or seen
by the prisoner at the bar, is to be used upon his trial against him?
FROST-1840-2,261.1143

Now, suppose some such answer were to come out, FROST-1840-2,261.1144

how is it possible for your Lordships, with the utmost care and desire
to exclude irrelevant matter, to divest the minds of the jury of the
effect of such an answer?  FROST-1840-2,261.1145

My Lord, I apprehend that upon the very clearest principles nothing
done or said by a body of persons of whom the prisoner is not proved to
have been one, and to which he is not proved directly or indirectly
to be at all a party, can be admissible in evidence against him.
FROST-1840-2,261.1146

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> I think we have a right to
see how this large body of men were collected.  FROST-1840-2,261.1147

The evidence might show that upon the very same road by which the
multitude arrived in the morning a large number of men on the preceding
night were found in such a part of the road, and another party upon
another part of the road, and that they met together at a certain place
to proceed for a general purpose; FROST-1840-2,261.1148

I think the question is clearly admissible.  FROST-1840-2,261.1149

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It is impossible to exclude
this evidence.  FROST-1840-2,261.1150

The prisoner will not be affected by it unless there is some evidence
afterwards to show that he was a party to it.  FROST-1840-2,261.1151

But you must go by steps; FROST-1840-2,261.1152

I think they may certainly prove that at an early period of the night a
number of persons armed were assembled in different parts of the country,
who were to be with the prisoner in the morning; FROST-1840-2,261.1153

that is clearly legitimate evidence; FROST-1840-2,261.1154

and supposing this witness proves that they fired upon him, that is
another fact from which it may be subsequently collected that there
was an armed force occupying that district, <P_262> which he afterwards
commanded and directed.  FROST-1840-2,262.1155

It is clearly admissible evidence.  FROST-1840-2,262.1156

Mr. Justice <font> Williams.  <$$font> Supposing this body of men
had been brought nearer in point of time, and nearer in point of distance
to the transactions at Newport, there could have been no question then
that this was admissible evidence.  FROST-1840-2,262.1157

Then the only difference is that it is more remote in distance and more
remote in time; FROST-1840-2,262.1158

but what difference does that make, except that the evidence is weaker?
FROST-1840-2,262.1159

I am totally at a loss to discover, in point of legal principle,
as to the question of admissibility, what distinction there can be.
FROST-1840-2,262.1160

The evidence may be weaker - FROST-1840-2,262.1161

it may prove less - FROST-1840-2,262.1162

but the state of the country that night and about that time is some proof
, so far as it goes, tending to throw some light upon what occurred at
that point of time; FROST-1840-2,262.1163

I admit not very near, and therefore just in that proportion more weak.
FROST-1840-2,262.1164

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> About how far is Risca from Newport?
FROST-1840-2,262.1165

- About six miles.  FROST-1840-2,262.1166

When you got near to Risca, did you hear any noise?  FROST-1840-2,262.1167

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,262.1168

What was that noise?  FROST-1840-2,262.1169

- I heard cheering, FROST-1840-2,262.1170

and I heard a gun fire.  FROST-1840-2,262.1171

About what o'clock would that be?  FROST-1840-2,262.1172

- I should think it was past eleven.  FROST-1840-2,262.1173

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> He is not now speaking of the
twelve men.  FROST-1840-2,262.1174

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> No; he saw the twelve men about
three miles from Newport; FROST-1840-2,262.1175

he is now about six.  FROST-1840-2,262.1176

- Did the cheering appear to you to be from one or more persons?
FROST-1840-2,262.1177

- It seemed to come from a good many.  FROST-1840-2,262.1178

How far were you beyond the place called the Welch Oak?
FROST-1840-2,262.1179

- About a mile, I should think.  FROST-1840-2,262.1180

Towards Risca?  FROST-1840-2,262.1181

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,262.1182

In what direction did the sound appear to you to be?
FROST-1840-2,262.1183

- From up the hills above Risca bridge.  FROST-1840-2,262.1184

When you heard this, did you go on, FROST-1840-2,262.1185

or did you return?  FROST-1840-2,262.1186

- I returned.  FROST-1840-2,262.1187

What sort of a night was it at this time?  FROST-1840-2,262.1188

- Raining, and very dark.  FROST-1840-2,262.1189

On your way back, when you got to Rigby's, the place you have spoken of,
did you see any persons?  FROST-1840-2,262.1190

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,262.1191

About what time would it be when you got to Rigby's the second time,
in coming back?  FROST-1840-2,262.1192

- I should think about twelve.  FROST-1840-2,262.1193

Tell us what you saw there?  FROST-1840-2,262.1194

- The men tried to stop me, FROST-1840-2,262.1195

and stabbed me.  FROST-1840-2,262.1196

Mr. <font> Kelly.  <$$font> Does your Lordship think this
evidence also?  FROST-1840-2,262.1197

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Yes; I do not see how we can
reject it.  FROST-1840-2,262.1198

what you saw?  FROST-1840-2,262.1199

<P_263>

What number of men?  FROST-1840-2,263.1205

- Across the road.  FROST-1840-2,263.1208

Were they in a line?  FROST-1840-2,263.1209

- Yes, I should think they were.  FROST-1840-2,263.1210

I could not see quite plain.  FROST-1840-2,263.1211

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Could you see whether they were
armed or not?  FROST-1840-2,263.1212

- I could not see.  FROST-1840-2,263.1213

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Did any thing happen to you?
FROST-1840-2,263.1214

- Yes, I was stabbed.  FROST-1840-2,263.1215

Could you tell with what you were stabbed?  FROST-1840-2,263.1216

- No.  FROST-1840-2,263.1217

Was it with a sharp instrument?  FROST-1840-2,263.1218

Did any thing else happen to you there?  FROST-1840-2,263.1220

- There was a pistol fired, or a gun.  FROST-1840-2,263.1221

Was it a considerable wound, or a small one?  FROST-1840-2,263.1228

- A large one.  FROST-1840-2,263.1229

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> You could not tell whether the
pistol was fired at you or not?  FROST-1840-2,263.1230

- I think it was fired at the man that was with me.  FROST-1840-2,263.1231

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Was Webb with you all this time?
FROST-1840-2,263.1232

- Yes.  FROST-1840-2,263.1233

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> What makes you think it was
fired at him?  FROST-1840-2,263.1234

- I was rather the first of the two.  FROST-1840-2,263.1235

I was five or six yards before him when it was fired.
FROST-1840-2,263.1236

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> He followed you?
FROST-1840-2,263.1237

- Yes, he did.  FROST-1840-2,263.1238

Was he so near that you could see him?  FROST-1840-2,263.1239

- Yes, I could see him.  FROST-1840-2,263.1240

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> See whom?  FROST-1840-2,263.1241

- Webb.  FROST-1840-2,263.1242

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Could you see whether any thing
happened to him or not?  FROST-1840-2,263.1243

- No, I could not tell.  FROST-1840-2,263.1244

Did you then go back to Newport?  FROST-1840-2,263.1245

- Yes, I did.  FROST-1840-2,263.1246

Did you report to the mayor what had occurred?  FROST-1840-2,263.1247

- I did.  FROST-1840-2,263.1248

When you arrived at Newport, in what state were you from your wound?
FROST-1840-2,263.1249

- I was very weak; FROST-1840-2,263.1250

I was obliged to be carried into the house.  FROST-1840-2,263.1251

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> That is not material.
FROST-1840-2,263.1252

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I dare say it is thought very
material.  FROST-1840-2,263.1253

Mr. <font> Wightman.  <$$font> Can you tell us whether your wound
had bled?  FROST-1840-2,263.1254

- Yes, it had bled a good deal.  FROST-1840-2,263.1255

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> The only value of the evidence
at all is to show that on the night in question there were parties of
men collected, some of whom were armed, in the direction from which
those persons came in the morning.  FROST-1840-2,263.1256

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> It is some evidence to go to
the jury, that these persons, whoever they were, fired upon this witness,
in order to prevent his communicating with Newport.  FROST-1840-2,263.1257

It is a matter for them to decide upon, FROST-1840-2,263.1258

but it is evidence to show that some armed force was collected in an
early part of the night.  FROST-1840-2,263.1259

<P_264>

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> Its effect will be for
consideration afterwards.  FROST-1840-2,264.1261

<font> Foreman of the Jury.  <$$font> I wish to ask a question.
FROST-1840-2,264.1262

Did you know any of the parties that you saw on the road?
FROST-1840-2,264.1263

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> He could not see them.
FROST-1840-2,264.1264

Mr. <font> Solicitor-general.  <$$font> I do not know to what
time your Lordships would propose to sit to-night.  FROST-1840-2,264.1265

The witness I am about to call would occupy some time.
FROST-1840-2,264.1266

Lord Chief Justice <font> Tindal.  <$$font> We will now adjourn till
tomorrow morning, at nine o'clock.  FROST-1840-2,264.1267

FROST-1840-2,265.1272

<$$heading>

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Before the next witness is
called, I wish to call your Lordship's attention to the deposition of
Captain Gray.  FROST-1840-2,265.1274

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Do you wish the deposition to
be read?  FROST-1840-2,265.1275

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> It $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be read, I presume, unless Captain Gray be asked about it;
FROST-1840-2,265.1276

but, considering a question that was put last night by one of the jurymen
, I am desirous of calling your Lordship's attention to it, and to ask
permission to put a question to Captain Gray; FROST-1840-2,265.1277

but I wish first to see the deposition.  FROST-1840-2,265.1278

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Have you got a copy of it?
FROST-1840-2,265.1279

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> No, I am furnished with
nothing but what I find in the newspapers, to which I have, as much as
possible, abstained from referring, because I did not think it proper.
FROST-1840-2,265.1280

Mr. Baron <font> Parke.  <$$font> Copies were applied for;
FROST-1840-2,265.1281

I do not know whether they were had.  FROST-1840-2,265.1282

Mr. <font> Bellamy.  <$$font> They were made, my Lord.
FROST-1840-2,265.1283

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I dare say that was so.
FROST-1840-2,265.1284

Mr. <font> Attorney-general.  <$$font> There would be no difficulty
in obtaining them.  FROST-1840-2,265.1285

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> Do not understand me, my Lord,
as making any complaint; FROST-1840-2,265.1286

I am making none.  FROST-1840-2,265.1287

<bracket> <font> The Deposition was handed to Sir Frederick Pollock,
who read the same.  <$$font> <$$bracket> FROST-1840-2,265.1288

Sir <font> F. Pollock.  <$$font> I feel very much obliged to your
Lordship, FROST-1840-2,265.1289

and I do not think it necessary to recal Captain Gray.
