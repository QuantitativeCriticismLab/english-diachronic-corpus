<font> Errors and Defects in Education.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,20.6

Advice to Parents and Teachers.  <$$font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,20.7

The errors which are frequently committed in education by parents, and
those to whom they transfer the care of their children, may be reckoned
one great source of human misery.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,20.8

A few instances will confirm the truth of this observation.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,20.9

In the first period of life, when the child is most susceptible of
impressions, he is surrounded with persons of low education and of
weak minds.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,20.10

The consequence is, <P_21> that he borrows their ideas, he imbibes their
prejudices, he adopts their manners.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.11

Being generally intrusted to such persons, he is often corrupted by the
manner in which he is treated by them.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.12

Is he peevish, for instance, and refuses to take his ordinary food?
CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.13

he is told, that unless he take what is offered him, it will be given
to another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.14

The tendency of such a practice is obvious.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.15

It $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fail of producing a selfish and malevolent
turn of mind.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.16

Is he discomposed by any accident?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.17

it is thought proper to punish the author of his misfortune, guilty or
innocent, animate or inanimate; CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.18

and, which is still worse, he is sometimes encouraged to inflict the
imaginary punishment himself, till at length, his passion having wreaked
itself, he recovers his former tranquility.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,21.19

Hence we see <P_22> how the heart is hardened, and how hatred, cruelty,
and revenge, so fatal to mankind, are implanted in the human breast.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,22.20

The manifold accidents to which we are continually exposed, the opposite
views and different tempers of mankind, and the precarious hold we have
of whatever is external, require that the mind should be formed, by an
early and prudent culture, to bear, with fortitude and self-command ,
the various troubles and misfortunes to which we may be subjected.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,22.21

Notwithstanding this, it is no uncommon thing, to see those children
whose tempers are warm, and who are susceptible of the finest feelings,
frequently neglected in this important point.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,22.22

Instead of teaching them patiently to endure pain and disappointment,
and the other evils of life, which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be altogether
avoided; instead of teaching <P_23> them to govern their passions, and
direct them to proper objects, their parents are often blind enough to
allow them to contract an impatience under misfortune, and an impetuosity
of spirit when thwarted, which, gathering strength from indulgence,
are often productive of trouble to others, and of misery to themselves.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,23.23

To sources of this kind may be traced many of those outrages which
disturb the peace of society, and blast the enjoyment of life.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,23.24

Instead of being taught candidly to acknowledge his faults, the child
is suffered to make excuses for them; and sometimes, by a direct lie,
to disown them.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,23.25

Thus the sacred regard which is due to truth is gradually diminished,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,23.26

and, that fence being broke down, dissimulation, the bane of virtue
, establishes an early and a powerful empire in the human heart.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,23.27

<P_24>

Is the child sluggish or refractory?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,24.29

it is thought proper to engage him to his duty by a bribe.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,24.30

Thus, instead of disinterestedness, and the love of virtue, he contracts
a sordid and mercenary turn, and a strong attachment to money, which
he looks upon as the great object that interests the passions of men ,
and the spring by which they ought to be moved: CHAPMAN-1774-1,24.31

and the high encomiums on it which he so frequently hears, the passion
for it which he observes in the generality of mankind, and the respect
which he sees paid to the rich, independent of their virtues, naturally
tend to pervert his taste, and teach him to associate the ideas of merit ,
and of happiness, with the possession of riches.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,24.32

If he gets money from his relations or friends, which they design,
through a fond but mistaken affection, as an expression of their regard
or esteem, he is often permitted, <P_25> or rather encouraged, to throw
it away in purchasing those things which will sow the seeds of luxury
and profusion in his tender mind.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,25.33

Hence that unhappy keenness for toys, fruits, sweat-meats {COM:sic} ,
&c. which we observe in youth, is nourished by indiscreet and
early indulgence; CHAPMAN-1774-1,25.34

and hence may be derived that desire of superfluities, and those
numerous artificial wants, with which a vitiated appetite, or depraved
taste, punishes those who depart from the simplicity of nature.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,25.35

Thus we are so far from cultivating a principle of virtue in children
during this early period, that we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fail,
by so unwary a conduct, to ingraft vice in their tender breasts.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,25.36

Hence it is that teachers find it so difficult a task, to root out of
their unfortunate pupils those false notions which they have already
formed, and to train them up, by virtuous <P_26> habits, to be good men
and useful members of society.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,26.37

When the child arrives at six or seven years, and begins now to multiply
his amusements, and to extend his acquaintance, seldom is sufficient
care taken to regulate his diversions, and make them subservient to the
improvement of his mind, or the health of his body.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,26.38

Is attention given in proportion to the flexibility of his temper, or
his want of experience, to shew him the difference of character among the
living as well as the dead; to guard him against the infectious example of
any idle or naughty children with whom he may have occasion to converse;
and to encourage an intimacy between him and those who are diligent,
modest, and virtuous?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,26.39

is he taught, with proper care, to strive with his equals in
the noble contest of making himself wiser and better than they?
CHAPMAN-1774-1,26.40

Is he taught, at the <P_27> same time, to suppress the first risings
of envy, that enemy of human happiness, and to resist the emotions of
pride and vanity, those silly and selfish passions which are so apt to
steal into the unguarded breasts of youth?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,27.41

Is he taught, likewise, to love his companions, to sympathize with them
under sickness or unfortunate accidents; to look upon all mankind as
his brethren, children of the same common parent; and to consider those
to whom he is superior in understanding, or in any of the advantages of
fortune, as intitled, upon all occasions, to his advice and assistance?
CHAPMAN-1774-1,27.42

The Author of nature, who confers his gifts with a liberal hand, and
adapts them with a parental foresight to the various exigencies of
mankind, often bestows a particular genius upon particular persons,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,27.43

and seems, by this wise provision, to have marked out the walk of life
<P_28> for which they were designed.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,28.44

Notwithstanding this innate and useful bias, it seldom happens that
either the parents or the instructors of a child apply their sagacity
to discover the bent of his genius, or direct his studies with a view
to render it most valuable to himself, and most beneficial to society.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,28.45

But if his genius be not particular, it would be proper, as he advances
through youth, and before he chuses his employment, to give him a just
view of the advantages and disadvantages which attend the different
occupations of mankind, and to point out to him how far any trade or
profession which he may have in view is useful to society, and how far
it may be suited to his capacity, his temper, and his constitution.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,28.46

Though such considerations as these ought to have great weight in
determining his choice, yet seldom is such attention given to <P_29>
direct him, as the importance of that critical step, and the need he
has of advice, seem to require.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,29.47

Unexperienced in life, and ignorant of what qualities are necessary in
different occupations, he is by no means a proper judge for himself:
CHAPMAN-1774-1,29.48

uninstructed by his parents or teachers, he is too ready to determine
himself by the taste of his companions, or by the little incidents
which may happen to strike his fancy in the place where he receives
his education.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,29.49

In this critical period he is seldom instructed, with proper care, in the
use of his time and his money; or taught to spend the former as becomes
a rational creature, to divest the latter of the false value stamped
upon it by the prejudices of mankind, and to view it in the true light
in which it ought to be viewed.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,29.50

To acquire those accomplishments and those habits, when young, which
<P_30> will render us useful in life; to provide for ourselves when of
age, and for our families, that they may not be burdens to society;
to give our children a virtuous education; to relieve the indigent,
to encourage modest merit, to promote honest industry and public spirit
among men, and, in general, to do good to our fellow-creatures, are the
great purposes to which our time and our money should be consecrated.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,30.51

We may observe too, that he is not sufficiently taught to look upon
industry in his future employment, and upon a faithful performance
of the duties of his station, as a debt which he owes to the public;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,30.52

nor is he instructed to value men by the decency and propriety with
which they acquit themselves in society, rather than by the rank which
they hold.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,30.53

He ought, among other things, to be taught that, if an employment be
useful, however humble, <P_31> it is never to be treated with ridicule
or contempt, and can never be so mean, as to preclude the person who
industriously and honestly follows it, from the protection and good
opinion of mankind.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,31.54

We see also that he is not directed, with proper care, to the surest
means of attaining happiness.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,31.55

Happiness, that great object which mankind universally pursue, may be
considered as consisting both in freedom from pain, and in enjoyment
of pleasure.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,31.56

To avoid pain, it is necessary he should not allow his lower appetites,
or selfish passions, to usurp that place in his breast which is due to
the nobler and more refined.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,31.57

To procure a succession of the most elevated pleasures he should not
rest satisfied with the regularity of an inoffensive conduct, while
unprofitable to others: CHAPMAN-1774-1,31.58

He should endeavour, by a proper exertion of his faculties, to render
his usefulness as <P_32> extensive as possible.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.59

And that he may be more useful in life, and consequently more happy, his
parents and teachers should take all possible pains to form his mind in
his early years, and to enforce their admonitions by a proper discipline.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.60

Thus he will acquire good habits when young; CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.61

and virtue will, by degrees, become easy, natural, delightful to him.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.62

But how shall parents train up their children, or teachers instruct
their pupils, and inspire them with a just taste of books and of manners,
unless they have acquired such a taste themselves?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.63

How can we expect to be happy ourselves, or to perform our duty to
those who are under our care, if we be hurried away by the violence of
our passions?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.64

It is true the passions are necessary to quicken our course in the great
voyage of human life: CHAPMAN-1774-1,32.65

and if we could learn to keep them within due bounds, how <P_33> smoothly
and how pleasantly should we sail over the ocean of life, which, in our
present circumstances, we find sometimes so tempestuous and so fatal!
CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.66

But the passions receive their direction, in a great measure, from the
ideas which we have learned to associate, and the opinions we have formed.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.67

It is natural for beings who live in society, and are constituted like
us, to try to excel one another: CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.68

but is it not as natural for them to try to excel in knowledge and virtue
, as in wealth or power?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.69

Is it not prejudice, and a shameful perversion of their faculties,
if they do not?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.70

To be sensible of an injury is natural: CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.71

but is it not also natural, since we are endued with moral feelings ,
and with reason as well as with passions, to set proper bounds to our
resentments, rather than allow them to hurry us away blindly into violence
and bloodshed?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,33.72

Are reason and conscience <P_34> placed within us to check the impetuosity
of our passions, CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.73

and shall we despise their heavenly admonitions?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.74

If then we would not be disappointed of our true happiness, which consists
in the perfection of our nature; if we would not be wanting in the duty
which we owe to those who are under our care, let us study our internal
constitution with the greatest attention; CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.75

let us try, by the due exercise of our reason, to strip outward objects
of that false and adventitious lustre which our early prejudices may
have thrown upon them, CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.76

and let us weigh every enjoyment in the scale of reason and of wisdom;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.77

let us be careful to acquire a taste in our pleasures;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.78

let us give the pleasures of sense, and of appetite, no more than their
subordinate and their proper place; CHAPMAN-1774-1,34.79

let us strive to make ourselves acquainted with those <P_35> which arise
from the culture of our intellectual powers, such as the love of knowledge
and the fine arts; CHAPMAN-1774-1,35.80

and, rising still higher in our taste, let us direct our ambition to
those of a moral kind, those of piety, fidelity, humanity, public
spirit, generosity, and the exalted joys of a self-approving mind.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,35.81

Were we thus enlightened in the pursuit of happiness, were we thus
formed to virtue, how delightful a spot would this earth be, and how
transporting the society of mankind!  CHAPMAN-1774-1,35.82

But if this be carrying our ideas too high, and if the rank which we hold
in the creation does not permit us, finite and short-sighted creatures
, to think of perfection here, we find ourselves, at least, bound by
every tie of duty and of interest, and by the very law of our nature,
not only to aspire at the highest attainable degrees of virtue ourselves,
but to lend our hand to others, and to conduct them up the arduous path.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,35.83

<P_36>

But whom shall a tutor conduct but his own pupils, whom he has engaged
to instruct?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,36.85

or whom shall a parent conduct rather than his own children; his children,
who are the most natural objects of his care, and the most proper subjects
of his culture?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,36.86

Thus employed, we shall cooperate with our almighty and beneficent Parent;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,36.87

and, inspired with benevolence and the love of virtue ourselves, we
shall be disposed to look upon others, when deviating from their duty,
not so much with hatred and horror, as with concern and compassion:
CHAPMAN-1774-1,36.88

we shall consider them as labouring under a distemper, as less fortunate
than we have been in the means of education, as less indebted to the
public for the opportunities given them of improving their understanding,
and of forming their taste in their early years.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,36.89

For though society justly punishes the breach of its laws, in <P_37>
order to bring us back to our duty, or to deter others from the like
practice; yet it appears, that, in many instances, mistaken views are
the occasion of vice, and that the folly of the transgressor is often
greater than his guilt.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,37.90

And it will not be denied, that if proper attention were given to
preserve the mind uncorrupted, and to cultivate it betimes, many of
those calamities which arise from irregular and ill-directed passions
might be prevented.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,37.91

But as I shall afterwards take the liberty, as occasion may require,
to put parents and teachers in mind of improving themselves, as well
as the children who are under their care, I shall not proceed to
exhort them at present, nor expatiate on the advantages which would
arise from a cultivated mind, and a rational pursuit of happiness.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,37.92

These are so obvious that they will not be disputed.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,37.93

Nor <P_38> is it necessary to swell the above detail of the mistakes
committed in educating children; or of the defects of the common
practice; since everyone, from his own observation, must make but too
many additions.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,38.94

And a very little reflection on this important subject will be sufficient
to discover the necessity of reforming the common methods of education,
and the room there is for improving them.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,38.95

How to cure such errors, and supply such defects, must be left in
a great measure to the ingenuity and care of parents and teachers.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,38.96

And as there are some circumstances which greatly obstruct their united
labours, I shall presume, in the course of this work, to point out a
scheme by which these obstructions may be removed.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,38.97

But how favourable soever the public institution may be rendered for the
education of youth; yet, if we consider the diversity of <P_39> tempers,
the struggle of passions, and the variety of cases that will occur,
we shall find, that, in different circumstances, different methods will
be necessary.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,39.98

The greatest pains should be taken to preserve those children
from infection whose minds are as yet uncorrupted by the world;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,39.99

and where medicine may be necessary for the mind, it should be adapted,
with a skilful hand, to the temper of the child, and the mental diseases
to which he is most liable.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,39.100

On this subject treatises have appeared, CHAPMAN-1774-1,39.101

and systems have been written; CHAPMAN-1774-1,39.102

and men of considerable reputation in the learned world, have not
disdained to employ their genius in laying down rules for the education
of youth.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,39.103

After all, it is still to be regretted that some of those systems are
too confined, and others too little suited to practice, and to the
circumstances <P_40> of mankind, connected in society, and depending
upon one another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,40.104

But as many ingenious observations have been made, and many useful
directions given, by Mr. Locke, Mr. Rousseau, and other
writers on education, I shall throw together such of their precepts and
remarks as appear to be of the most extensive use; CHAPMAN-1774-1,40.105

and, mingling some reflections of my own, I shall publish them, thus
blended together, as the second part of this treatise, after having
prefixed some rules laid down by approved physicians for the management
of infants.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,40.106

Much, as has been already hinted, will still depend upon the parents,
and much more upon the qualifications and character of the persons to
whom they transfer their authority.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,40.107

But of this hereafter.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,40.108

It will be proper, first, to inquire, whether children should be educated
in public or in <P_41> private; how a school should be constituted
and governed; and to consider the nature and degrees of education
necessary for the lower ranks; that is, the far greater part of mankind.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,41.109

Sect. III.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,41.111

<$$heading>

<font> Strictures on Private Education.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,41.113

Advantages and Disadvantages of Public Education.  <$$font>
CHAPMAN-1774-1,41.114

One unfavourable circumstance in a private education is the dependence
of tutors on the parents <P_42> of their pupils.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,42.115

On these they depend, not only for their present subsistence, but
frequently also for their future establishment; CHAPMAN-1774-1,42.116

and as parents are not always the best judges of education, nor always
considerate enough to invest the tutor with proper authority, he is
sometimes constrained to adopt that method of instruction which the
parents lay down for their children, how improper soever that method may
be, and to submit to the caprice of his pupils, whom he ought to direct.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,42.117

Another disadvantage is, the risk a boy thus educated, runs of being
perverted in his temper, as well as retarded in his studies, by undue
indulgence from his parents, and by servile flattery from domestics.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,42.118

This is often complained of by private tutors: CHAPMAN-1774-1,42.119

and indeed it is natural to suppose, that, by this means, a boy, though
otherwise capable of <P_43> the best impressions, will be in danger
of becoming untractable, and impatient of contradiction, arbitrary
in his principles, as well as unsocial and tyrannical in his temper.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,43.120

Hence he will be disposed to treat those of an inferior rank with
insolence, as well as contempt; CHAPMAN-1774-1,43.121

and having hitherto met with little opposition to his desires, and not
knowing what it is to live on an equality with others of the like age
with himself, he will expect the same compliance from the world which
he met with at home.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,43.122

And as he will often find himself disappointed of the homage which he so
long considered as his due, he must become peevish and uneasy, and feel,
on many occasions, the disagreeable effects of the injustice that was
done him in his early years.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,43.123

Add to this, that a private education is not of so great efficacy in
exciting a spirit of emulation.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,43.124

There <P_44> is implanted in the human mind an ardent desire to excel.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.125

This desire, operating with greater force in society, proves a strong
motive with the generality of boys, CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.126

and keeps some awake who would otherwise languish in sloth, if they
were not frequently roused by the application of this powerful spur.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.127

Powerful it is; CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.128

for by it the giddy may be fixed, CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.129

the passionate may be restrained, CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.130

and the sluggish may be roused.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.131

The consciousness of excelling is so pleasant, and of being excelled
so painful, that the hardest task will be attempted, and the severest
restraint endured, in hopes of attaining the former and avoiding the
latter.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.132

This emulation, this virtuous rivalship for knowledge, ought never to
be checked, CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.133

and will not be easily rooted out, while social institutions remain.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,44.134

It is therefore the business of a public education to watch over a passion
which is to <P_45> have such influence over us, and so to govern it,
that it may never degenerate into envy.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,45.135

Let us, both parents and teachers, avail ourselves of this propensity
to vie with one another, CHAPMAN-1774-1,45.136

and let us lead youth to a rivalship in virtue as well as in knowledge.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,45.137

Let us set them an example ourselves.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,45.138

For our encouragement, tho'we should miss the first prize in this glorious
contest, yet our labour will not be lost.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,45.139

A Sketch of The Author's Method of Instruction in the Grammar-school
of Dumfries.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,179.143

Sect. I.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,179.144

<font> Of the Method of teaching the Principles of the Latin Tongue.
<$$font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,179.145

<$$heading>

The first thing beginners are taught in this school, is the use of
language in general, the letters of the Roman alphabet, their powers and
different classes, the way of combining syllables into words, the nature
of a noun, both <P_180> substantive and adjective, the declension of an
English noun, and the terminations of Latin nouns as they correspond to
the different cases of the five declensions.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,180.147

To impress these terminations more deeply on the mind of the scholar, a
variety of examples is prescribed, and care taken to ask him the cases ,
not only as they stand in his rudiments, but also promiscuously, and
from one declension to another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,180.148

Then he is carried forward to the adjectives; which are taught
with the like care, and their degrees of comparison explained.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,180.149

Thus prepared, he is taught this rule in syntax,"An adjective agrees
with a substantive in gender, number, and case;" CHAPMAN-1774-1,180.150

and various examples are given him; as, <font> a white horse, a deep
river, a high tree, <$$font> and the like.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,180.151

In these exercises, he is taught to put the substantive first in the
case required, and then to make <P_181> the adjective agree with it in
all its accidents; by which means this rule, which occurs so often, and
gives so much trouble to the learner, is rendered plain and familiar.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,181.152

Then he is taught the pronouns, which, after the foregoing exercises,
he learns with ease.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,181.153

He proceeds next to the verbs, CHAPMAN-1774-1,181.154

and is carefully taught their nature and accidents, CHAPMAN-1774-1,181.155

and runs over the tenses of <font> amo, <$$font> as they stand in his
book, with the way of forming them from the four principal parts of the
verb: CHAPMAN-1774-1,181.156

then he is examined upon the tenses promiscuously, and at great length.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,181.157

<P_182>

When, by repeated exercises, he is pretty much master of <font> amo,
<$$font> and <P_183> two or three other verbs taken from his vocabulary ,
as, <font> voco, do, veto, <$$font> he is carried forward to the second
conjugation; CHAPMAN-1774-1,183.159

and after learning <font> doceo, <$$font> and a few more verbs, as
, <font> jubeo, augeo, torqueo, <$$font> he proceeds to the third
conjugation; CHAPMAN-1774-1,183.160

and having run over <font> lego, scribo, frango, capio, <$$font> and
the like, he is advanced to the fourth.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,183.161

By this time his labour being greatly diminished, he is taught <font>
audio, munio, sepelio, baudio, <$$font> all in the same manner as
<font> amo.  <$$font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,183.162

And as a verb is the principal part of speech, and occurs in every
sentence, it is thought necessary to inculcate it upon him by the most
frequent and laborious exercises.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,183.163

Particular care is likewise taken to ask such questions as will try his
skill in distinguishing one conjugation from another, and prevent his
blundering afterwards; such as,"they read - they love - they command
- they draw - we will write - we <P_184> will give - we will bury -
CHAPMAN-1774-1,184.164

what does <font> amamus <$$font> signify in English?  <font> scribamus?
amemus?  bauriemus?  &c. <$$font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,184.165

He is now taught the second rule of his syntax, viz. the agreement
of a finite verb with its nominative, and carried through a variety of
examples upon the first two rules, till he has acquired a dexterity in
applying them.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,184.166

A lesson of this kind he prepares every morning from his vocabulary,
consisting of three substantives, as many adjectives, and one verb,
which is gradually increased till he has got a pretty large stock of
nouns and verbs, and can vary them through all their different accidents.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,184.167

The rest of the day he is employed in learning the irregular and defective
verbs, the nature of a participle, and the four indeclinable parts of
speech as laid down in his rudiments.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,184.168

After this the different classes of nouns, pronouns, and verbs, are
explained; CHAPMAN-1774-1,184.169

<P_185>

then he proceeds to the 28th, 44th, and 4th rules of his syntax,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,185.171

and runs through various examples of these, as well as of the first two
rules, while he reads Corderius.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,185.172

The foundation being thus laid, he begins to learn the rules for the
genders of nouns and for the conjugation of verbs from his grammar,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,185.173

and is accustomed to take notice of the compound verbs as he proceeds.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,185.174

Along with these exercises on grammar, he is taught more fully to
parse the English language, and to translate from it into Latin.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,185.175

For this purpose he is carried through a variety of short sentences
prescribed by the master <font> viva voce, <$$font> as before;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,185.176

then taking Corderius, literally translated, or Mair's Introduction,
<P_186> he reads some of the simplest sentences in the English column,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,186.177

and points out the different parts of speech contained in them, and
their dependance {COM:sic} upon one another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,186.178

This method, being gradually extended to the most complex sentences,
he analyses their ingredients, CHAPMAN-1774-1,186.179

and shews their connection with one another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,186.180

In the mean time he advances through the other rules of syntax, which he
is taught in their natural order from Mr. Ruddiman's Rudiments,
viz. rule 68.  69.  10.  11.  75.  76.  27.  &c. with
proper examples prescribed by the master <font> viva` voce, <$$font>
as well as from the Introduction.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,186.181

In these exercises from the Introduction, he is accustomed first to
read <P_187> the English sentences with a clear and distinct voice;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.182

then he parses them, CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.183

and applies his rules of construction.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.184

And as the parts of speech in the Latin column are by this time pretty
plain to him, if he is a boy but of a moderate capacity, he will turn the
English sentence into Latin with ease, and sometimes without a blunder.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.185

Being now acquainted with the nature of a sentence, and the rules of
syntax, he begins the classical authors, CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.186

continues every day to get a lesson from his vocabulary and introduction,
till towards the end of the fourth year, and from the grammar till he
has finished it, CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.187

and afterwards repeats it only once in the week.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.188

But that the principles of the Latin tongue may be more fully known,
and more deeply rivetted in the mind, he is accustomed also to parse
and construe every lesson of his lower authors; CHAPMAN-1774-1,187.189

and besides all <P_188> these exercises, two or three of the classes are ,
every Friday afternoon, examined together upon the declension of nouns ,
the conjugation of verbs, the cases which adjectives and verbs govern,
and the like questions upon etymology and syntax.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,188.190

This keeps their emulation awake, CHAPMAN-1774-1,188.191

and preserves their knowledge of grammar.  For which purpose they employ
likewise Saturday morning in repetitions of the vocabulary, of the
grammar, and of the rules of syntax, except what part of it they spend
in repeating the questions of their catechisms.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,188.192

<P_189>

<heading>

Sect. II.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,189.195

<font> What Books are taught, and in what Order; with the Manner
of teaching the Principles of the English Language.  <$$font>
CHAPMAN-1774-1,189.196

<$$heading>

If boys have not begun the study of the Latin tongue before they enter to
this school, the first book they read is Mr. Ruddiman's Rudiments
, then Mr. Mair's Vocabulary; which not only furnishes them with
a stock of words, but is likewise a very proper book for exemplifying
the declensions and conjugations.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,189.198

Along with the Vocabulary they are taught the principal rules of syntax
in English, in the manner pointed out in the preceding section, with the
rules of grammar for the genders of nouns and conjugations of verbs :
CHAPMAN-1774-1,189.199

and as they apply these rules <P_190> to the Vocabulary, and get a lesson
of it once every day, they acquire at length a remarkable readiness with
respect to that most useful part of grammar.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,190.200

Then they proceed to the other rules of syntax, CHAPMAN-1774-1,190.201

and make exercises upon them in the same manner as upon the principal
rules.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,190.202

In the mean time they read, likewise, for the other lessons of the day
, several Colloquies of Corderius; which, being ranged in the order of
construction, enlarge their exercises on grammar, and prepare them for
the study of the classics.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,190.203

This is the business of the first two years; CHAPMAN-1774-1,190.204

and it must be owned, that while children are thus employed, they may
be said to be <P_191> learning little more than the principles of the
Latin tongue.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,191.205

But it is thought necessary, in the first place, to inculcate these with
the greatest exactness, as the most solid foundation of the progress
they are afterwards to make in science or learning of any kind: so
that this great expence of time and labour, though bestowed, as it
were, upon the elements of one language, is by no means thrown away;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,191.206

it is amply compensated by the effect it has upon their future
studies, which it renders more pleasant, and more successful.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,191.207

The third year they read Phaedrus, and Cor. Nepos, and sometimes
a little of Eutropius; CHAPMAN-1774-1,191.208

but before they begin Cor. Nepos, they are instructed in the
principles of Geography; CHAPMAN-1774-1,191.209

and they continue to get daily lessons from the Vocabulary, Grammar,
and Introduction, in the <P_192> manner pointed out in the last section.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.210

The fourth year they proceed to Caesar, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and Sallust;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.211

and, for a sacred lesson, they read sometimes Castalio's Latin translation
of the New Testament.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.212

They begin Virgil and the Greek Grammar: CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.213

they revise Mair's Introduction, CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.214

and read Christie's also; which enlarges their praxis on syntax, and,
with so extensive a preparation, costs them very little time and labour.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.215

And sometimes they begin, this year, to write versions from their
introductions, and to translate Lockman's Roman History into English.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.216

This year an hour is set apart, every day, for teaching the principles
of the English tongue.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,192.217

For that most useful study, the boys of this class are sufficiently
prepared by their acquaintance with syntax, and by the stock of Latin
words <P_193> which they have already acquired.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.218

The manner in which they are taught the principles of the English tongue
is this: CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.219

Newbery's, or Entick's, Spelling-Dictionary being taken as a text-book,
they are examined upon it.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.220

In this exercise, taking the order of the alphabet, they spell the word
as they go along, CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.221

tell its meaning, CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.222

distinguish it from other words resembling it in orthography or
pronunciation, CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.223

and trace its origin, if it is of a Latin derivation.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.224

This praxis is very useful to them, as many English words of two
syllables, and most of those which exceed that number, are of a Latin
original.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.225

Some indeed are from the Greek; CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.226

and others have been adopted from the French: CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.227

but a little acquaintance with the Greek and French languages will,
afterward, render these sufficiently plain.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,193.228

After these exercises, Mr. Fisher's English Grammar is carefully
taught, <P_194> and Dr. Lowth's excellent Grammar recommended to
their perusal.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,194.229

And these exercises are further improved, in the course of their studies ,
as will afterwards be more particularly observed, by the English versions
which they are ordered to write, and by the best English translations of
their authors which they are accustomed to read.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,194.230

The fifth year they proceed through Virgil, CHAPMAN-1774-1,194.231

and read two or three books of Livy; then Horace, Buchanan's Psalms,
the Self-tormentor of Terence, and Cicero's treatises on Old Age and
Friendship, with the Greek Testament, Aesop, Cebes, and a book or two
of Homer's Iliad.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,194.232

They are frequently examined upon the history of Greece, Rome , and
England, with Chronology, and Kennet's Antiquities; CHAPMAN-1774-1,194.233

and they are carried through a course of practical Geography.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,194.234

And their other <P_195> exercises, this year, are translations and
versions from Lockman's Roman History, Kimber's History of England,
and the Spectator, in which they are very much employed; as also English
versions from the Latin classics.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,195.235

If they continue another year at school, they read Pliny's Epistles and
Cicero's Offices, CHAPMAN-1774-1,195.236

proceed through Homer, CHAPMAN-1774-1,195.237

and sometimes they learn Xenophon's Memorabilia Socratis, and sometimes
his Cyropaideia, CHAPMAN-1774-1,195.238

and write Latin and English versions at least once every week.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,195.239

As the Roman authors above mentioned are all, except Eutropius, standards
of the Latin tongue, and of fine writing in their different kinds, the
boys who are educated here learn them more or less, CHAPMAN-1774-1,195.240

and seldom fail to read a great part of <P_196> Sallust, Virgil,
and Horace.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.241

Sometimes too, in the lower classes, they read a little of Florus, or
Justin, or Q. Curtius, or Buchanan's History of Scotland; and in
the highest class, Tacitus's Life of Agricola, and his Description of
the Manners of the Germans.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.242

The classics which are principally read here, are very proper for forming
the style and taste of the elder scholars; CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.243

but it is much to be wished that we had some Latin authors suited to
the lower classes.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.244

The language of such authors should be pure, and free from figurative
expressions; CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.245

the sentences should be short and clear; CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.246

and the subject should be the lives of eminent men, or such passages
in history, whether ancient or modern, as afford both entertainment
and instruction.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,196.247

The best thing of this kind that has hitherto appeared is a collection
from the classics, intitled, <font> Selectae e` profanis <$$font> <P_197>
<font> scriptoribus historiae; <$$font> which is sometimes taught in
this school.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,197.248

As Poetry rises often above the strictness of truth, and soars, with
peculiar boldness, into the regions of fancy; so it requires that its
style be raised above that of common life; and in the Latin, as well as
the English language, may be said to be a dialect very different from
that of prose.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,197.249

For this reason, the youth at this school are not taught Virgil and
Horace till they are properly prepared for them; that is, till they
have overcome the difficulties of syntax, and till they have read the
plainest prose authors, and got the figurative style, the nature of
poetry and its different kinds explained.  For which purpose, select
passages from Trapp's Lectures, Newbery on Poetry, the Preceptor,
Rollin's Belles Lettres, and the Elements of Criticism, are carefully
read and illustrated; CHAPMAN-1774-1,197.250

then the best English poets, <P_198> descriptive, pastoral, and
epic, such as, Thomson, Pope, Milton, are put into their hands
from the school-library, and warmly recommended to their perusal.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,198.251

This introduction to poetry, and this perusal of the most celebrated
poems in the English language, are thought necessary for giving youth
a critical taste of that kind.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,198.252

But as a natural genius for poetry is absolutely requisite for forming
a poet, and is not to be acquired by art, though it may be greatly
improved by it; therefore it is not attempted here to impose a study
upon youth, which nature has forbid to the generality of mankind.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,198.253

And indeed the wisdom of this prohibition will appear, if we consider
, that a genius for poetry, if more widely diffused, would be very
unsuitable to the different circumstances in which men are placed
, and the various occupations which they are obliged to follow.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,198.254

<P_199>

For these reasons it is, that, after holding out those lamps which the
ancient poets have lighted up, and those which some of the moderns have
kindled in their turn, to conduct their brethren to the temple of the
Muses, it is thought proper to encourage those only on whom nature has
bestowed a poetical spirit, to pursue a path, which is no less hazardous
than it is honourable.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,199.256

<heading>

Sect. III.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,199.258

<font> The Method of Reading and Explaining the Classics.  <$$font>
CHAPMAN-1774-1,199.259

<$$heading>

Till boys have laid in a considerable stock of Latin words, and till
they can vary them through all their different accidents, and apply the
rules of syntax with ease, they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be supposed ripe
for <P_200> explaining the classics.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.261

The arrangement of words in the Latin tongue, which gives it so much
strength and spirit, being so different from that of the English, would
render so preposterous an attempt extremely difficult and perplexing.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.262

It is in order to $lessen {TEXT:lesson} this difficulty, as well as to
extend their knowledge of grammar, that, as we have already observed, the
younger boys of this school are taught some colloquies from Corderius
, literally translated, and ranged in the order of construction.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.263

In reading these, the teacher, first of all, relates the subject of the
lesson in the simplest language; CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.264

then he explains it word by word from the English translation,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.265

and runs over the parts of speech and rules of construction.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.266

Sometimes the foremost boy of the class is charged with the studies of
the rest; CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.267

at other times they sit in separate parties, CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.268

and assist one another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,200.269

<P_201>

When they are ordered to give an account of their lesson, first they
translate it into English, each in his turn, CHAPMAN-1774-1,201.271

and then they analyse, or parse it, as below.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,201.272

<P_202>

After the sentence is thus analysed, and the rules of grammar given for
the nouns and verbs contained in it, one of the boys is ordered to give
the rules of construction for the whole sentence, as the words depend
upon one another.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,202.274

Thus <font> Decet te otiari: <$$font>"These four <font> decet,
delectat"<$$font> &c. CHAPMAN-1774-1,202.275

<font> Otiari aut garrire: <$$font>"The conjunct. <font> et, ac,
atque,"<$$font> &c. <font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,202.276

Praeceptor expectatur: <$$font>"A verb agrees with the nominative,
"&c. CHAPMAN-1774-1,202.277

As soon as they begin to read the classics, where the arrangement of
words is inverted, they are taught how to resolve a Latin sentence
into the order of construction, and accustomed to prepare the parts of
speech in the lesson before it is explained, with the order and rules
of construction, <P_203> and deliver them in their turn as above.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,203.278

The lesson is then explained by the teacher, and time allowed them to
prepare the interpretation.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,203.279

And when it may be supposed to be sufficiently imprinted on their minds,
and the impression confirmed by an interval of an <P_204> hour or two,
they explain it to the master; CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.280

and, last of all, one of them relates the subject in his own language ,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.281

and sometimes tells the moral which it conveys.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.282

This method is pursued while they read Eutropius, Phaedrus, and
Cor. Nepos; CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.283

and the difficulties of syntax being by this time surmounted, and the
way to learning cleared, they begin now to taste those fruits, those
innocent and delicious fruits, with which the ancients have sweetened
the road to science.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.284

While they read Caesar and the succeeding prose authors, being now
masters of a considerable number of words, both primitive and derivative
, they parse only the more difficult and uncommon words in the lesson;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.285

then they construe it, CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.286

and hear it explained by the teacher.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.287

And after they have prepared and explained it, they take an English
translation, CHAPMAN-1774-1,204.288

and render it back into <P_205> Latin, which is found to be a very proper
introduction to a classical style.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,205.289

Last of all, the teacher asks them the most remarkable phrases which
occur in the lesson, in order to make them still better acquainted with
the propriety of expression and difference of idiom in the two languages.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,205.290

For instance, if they were reading in the beginning of Sallust, they
would be asked such phrases as these:"To exert themselves with all
their power,"<font> Niti summa` ope; <$$font> -"To excel any one,
"<font> Praestare alicui, <$$font> &c. CHAPMAN-1774-1,205.291

In reading the Latin poets, first of all they deliver the parts of speech
, the order of the words, the most remarkable rules of construction,
the prosody of a part of the lesson, and generally the literal English
of the whole.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,205.292

Then the master relates the subject of the lesson, CHAPMAN-1774-1,205.293

renders the Latin passage into proper English, CHAPMAN-1774-1,205.294

and points out whatever is <P_206> most beautiful in the sentiment,
as well as most elegant in the expression.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,206.295

The lesson being prepared, and the interpretation delivered at the next
meeting of the school, the best poetical translation of it into English
is read aloud by one of the boys, and sometimes by the master; who does
this with a view to make his pupils acquainted with English poetry,
to shew them more fully the difference of idiom in the two languages,
and to enable them to read the poets, both Latin and English, with more
understanding and pleasure.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,206.296

In like manner, while they learn Sallust, Terence, Pliny, and Cicero ,
he either reads aloud the best English translation of the author they
are studying, CHAPMAN-1774-1,206.297

or causes one of the class to read it.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,206.298

Besides the other advantages of this practice, it accustoms them
to read the English language with propriety and <P_207> ease,
which is an accomplishment no less useful than it is agreeable.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,207.299

In order that those beautiful sentiments, and those useful maxims,
which occur so often in Virgil, Horace, and Homer, may make the deeper
impression on the mind, and serve as ready and agreeable monitors in
the conduct of life, the scholars are accustomed to get by heart select
passages from those admired authors.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,207.300

<P_208>

<heading>

Sect. IV.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,208.303

<font> The Method of translating from English into Latin, and from Latin
into English.  <$$font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,208.304

<$$heading>

So different is the idiom of the Latin from that of the English, that
to translate with propriety from the one into the other, and especially
from the latter into the former, is thought a very difficult task,
and is believed by many to be more than can be expected from the tender
years and the confined ideas of a school-boy.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,208.306

It is this, no doubt, that puts his skill in the Latin tongue to the
severest trial.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,208.307

But this task, difficult as it may appear, is not impracticable.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,208.308

The many instances of young men who have attained a classical style
before they left the grammar-school, prove, that <P_209> it is possible
for a boy of an ordinary capacity to write Latin with a good deal of
accuracy and ease, by the time he is fifteen or sixteen years of age,
if he begin to study it when he is nine or ten years old, and if he be
properly exercised in that way.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,209.309

In the same period, he may likewise acquire some notion of the Greek
, and make a considerable progress towards a good English style.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,209.310

I say, a boy of an ordinary capacity; CHAPMAN-1774-1,209.311

for it is from the proficiency of such that the merit of the teacher
can be estimated.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,209.312

There are some boys upon whom nature has bestowed such a quickness and
maturity of genius, that they will easily surmount all the disadvantages
of the most stupid and preposterous method.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,209.313

There are others again whose minds are so late in opening, that they
begin but to blossom, as it were, when they have reached their fifteenth
or sixteenth year.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,209.314

On these the <P_210> nature of language, and the elegancies of diction ,
will make but a faint impression during that period which is commonly
assigned for a school-education, though they are sometimes found to make
afterwards great proficiency in knowledge, and are frequently observed
to be very successful in business.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,210.315

This classical stile is an object which the teacher ought always to have
in his eye: CHAPMAN-1774-1,210.316

without it we must be often at a loss for the meaning of the Latin
authors; CHAPMAN-1774-1,210.317

without it we can neither see the beauties of that manly language, nor
read the admired compositions of the ancients with profit or pleasure.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,210.318

It is with a view to this purity of style that the boys at this school
are carried, in a gradual and natural way, through the principles of
the Latin tongue, taught both Introductions with the greatest care,
and accustomed to turn into Latin the literal translations <P_211>
of the lower authors.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.319

With a like view it is that they are exercised in turning a great part
of Lockman's Roman History into Latin; not on account of its style
, the inaccuracies of which are pointed out in the course of their
lessons, but for the connection it has with the Latin historians:
CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.320

and as a farther exercise of this kind, they translate several passages
from Kimber's History of England.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.321

In these exercises they are not ordered to write their translation,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.322

but are allowed, for the greater expedition, to deliver it <font> viva`
voce; <$$font> CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.323

and being accustomed to vary the same sentence different ways, they
acquire, by degrees, a readiness and a copiousness of expression.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.324

While they read Sallust, Livy, Terence, and Cicero, a free translation
is put into their hands when the lesson is over, CHAPMAN-1774-1,211.325

and they render sometimes it, and sometimes the <P_212> English of other
passages, into Latin.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.326

For this purpose a short time is allowed them; CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.327

and when they have prepared, and delivered their translation, the
original is read over as the model by which they are to correct and form
their style.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.328

It is after a little acquaintance with Terence and Cicero that they
begin to translate some papers from the Spectator.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.329

Besides all this, twice or thrice every week they write a Latin version
in the public school, prescribed out of some of the above-mentioned
English books, CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.330

and present it, to be examined at the same meeting of the school.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.331

And every year in the month of August, they compose a Latin poem, which
they present to the Magistrates and Town-council, with a translation of
it into English verse.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,212.332

This poem is called <font> a Supplication, <$$font> because it contains
a request for the <P_213> autumnal vacation; CHAPMAN-1774-1,213.333

and is revised by the master, who is sometimes obliged to assist them
in making it.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,213.334

Though the poetical spirit $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be expected, unless
in those whom nature has endued with a particular genius for poetry,
yet an exercise of this kind, once in the year, is neither impracticable
nor improper for those in the highest class.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,213.335

It is not impracticable; CHAPMAN-1774-1,213.336

for, by this time, being acquainted with the Latin poets, and some of
the English also, they may supply themselves with poetical expressions
from thence: CHAPMAN-1774-1,213.337

and it is not improper; as it obliges them to study an exactness in
prosody, a thing too much neglected in many schools, though attended to
by the ancient Romans with the most scrupulous delicacy, and absolutely
necessary, if you would read the classics with gracefulness or pleasure.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,213.338

At the same time the students are warned not to <P_214> do violence to
nature, by indulging a turn for versification, if they be not endued
with an original genius for poetry.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,214.339

It has been already observed, that in order to instruct them in the
principles of the English tongue, and make them acquainted with its
genius, they are taught the Spelling-Dictionary and English Grammar ,
and accustomed to read over a free translation of Sallust, Livy, Terence,
Cicero, Pliny.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,214.340

For their further improvement in that useful language, it is thought
proper, with that preparation, to prescribe to them, every other day,
passages from the said classics, to be translated into English, and
presented at the same meeting of the school.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,214.341

On these occasions particular care is taken to cause them to correct their
inaccuracies either in the spelling, pointing, or idiom, and to form them
to a perspicuous and unaffected <P_215> style.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.342

And the best English authors are recommended, some of which they have
an opportunity of reading from the library belonging to the school.

Sect. V.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.345

<font> Observations on History.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.346

Method of preparing Youth for the Study of it.  <$$font>
CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.347

<$$heading>

As it is better to learn wisdom from the fate of others who have
lived before us, than to trust to our own experience and confined
observation of what passes around us, History is recommended to youth
as the parent of knowledge, and the great instructress of human life.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.349

In History we survey the various generations of mankind passing, as it
were, in review before our eyes.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.350

There we observe the different characters of men, CHAPMAN-1774-1,215.351

mark <P_216> their fate, CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.352

find it proportioned to their behaviour, CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.353

discern the superior advantages of wisdom and virtue,
CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.354

and learn that misfortune and shame are the dismal portion of folly
and vice.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.355

There we discover, that to sacrifice our intellectual, our moral
enjoyments, to the lower and more inglorious propensities of our
nature, is, in reality, to inflict a heavy punishment on ourselves;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.356

there likewise we see, that no acquisition we can make is so fair, and
so valuable, as a mind enlightened with knowledge, and principled with
virtue; CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.357

there we observe, not only the fate of individuals, but also the various
revolutions of empire, CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.358

and behold the conquerors and the conquered swallowed up at length in
undistinguished ruin.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.359

If we look back but a few years, they who acted on the theatre of human
life are now no more.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,216.360

What is become, it may be asked, of their deep-laid <P_217> schemes,
their ambitious projects, their anxious cares, their adored riches,
their dazzling honours, their alluring pleasures?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,217.361

Of what consequence to them now are all those objects which
so much engrossed their wishes, or exercised their passions?
CHAPMAN-1774-1,217.362

If we look forward but one century into futurity, where are we ourselves?
CHAPMAN-1774-1,217.363

Gone, for ever gone, CHAPMAN-1774-1,217.364

and the places of our abode know us again no more.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,217.365

From a view of the native dignity and happy consequences of virtue on
the one hand, and the inherent meanness and unhappy effects of vice
on the other, shall we not learn to restrain our inordinate desires,
and direct them to objects more worthy of our nature, and more fitted
for procuring us solid and lasting felicity?  CHAPMAN-1774-1,217.366

From reflecting on the shortness and uncertainty of life, shall we not
learn to value <P_218> our time more highly, and improve it more usefully?
CHAPMAN-1774-1,218.367

But it is only to the discerning and considerate reader that History
affords instruction.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,218.368

Youth therefore, who are naturally thoughtless and inconsiderate, are
particularly to be instructed in the use they ought to make of history,
and directed to the books they ought to read.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,218.369

And while they are obliged, in studying it, to wade through long details
of the wars and the vices of men, let them be warned to bestow upon
the unhappy actors of those unnatural scenes that pity which is due to
the delusions, as well as that detestation which is due to the vices,
of mankind: CHAPMAN-1774-1,218.370

let them be taught to pass them over with a slighter glance, and to give
more particular attention to those objects which are worthy of their
approbation and esteem; the civilizers of mankind, the inventors of useful
<P_219> arts, the friends of liberty and learning, and those persons whom
History records as most eminent for justice, generosity , temperance,
fidelity, fortitude, humanity, and public spirit.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,219.371

What pity is it that examples of this sort, in the humbler as well as the
more exalted stations of life, have not been more particularly attended
to, and more carefully collected!  CHAPMAN-1774-1,219.372

What pity is it they have not been honoured with those encomiums which
they deserve, and transmitted from age to age for the improvement of
mankind, instead of those scenes of carnage and devastation which the
historian presents so often to our view.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,219.373

Furnished with a more amiable picture of human nature, and dazzled no
longer with the glare of pomp and conquest, we should have been in less
danger of deceiving ourselves in our notions of grandeur and of happiness.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,219.374

Such illustrious patterns <P_220> of private as well as of public virtue
, thus held up for our imitation, would have naturally produced in us
a glorious emulation and a heroic desire to promote the most valuable
interests of mankind.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,220.375

So feeble are the minds of children, and so apt to be misled by pomp
and shew, that the greatest attention should be given to direct them
in the study of history, and to lay before them such reflections as
may tend to form their taste, and teach them wherein virtue and true
greatness consist.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,220.376

With a view to render this study more useful to the children at this
<P_221> school, as soon as they begin to read Cor. Nepos, they get
some instructions on the nature and use of history, which are afterwards
extended as they advance to the higher classes.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,221.377

And that they may be better prepared for the study of ancient as well
as modern history, and may have a clearer idea of what they read in the
classics, the principles of Geography are explained at a separate hour ,
and the most curious and useful problems performed by the help of the
Terrestrial and Celestial Globes.  CHAPMAN-1774-1,221.378

Then the four great divisions of the earth, their boundaries, and
the different states they contain, with the most remarkable places,
rivers, &c. in each, are pointed out on the Terrestrial Globe
, and more particularly on the respective maps of those divisions.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,221.379

A set of Maps, adapted to the classics, is likewise put into their hands;
CHAPMAN-1774-1,221.380

and, the fifth year, Mair's Survey of the <P_222> Terraqueous Globe,
being used as a text-book, they are carried through a course of Practical
Geography, as was formerly mentioned, CHAPMAN-1774-1,222.381

and directions are given them how to improve themselves farther in this
entertaining study from Salmon, Guthrie, Varenius, and other Geographers.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,222.382

By means of this preparation, and a little Chronology for distinguishing
the different periods of history, and the ages of the most eminent men,
they are enabled to read by themselves with understanding and pleasure.
CHAPMAN-1774-1,222.383
