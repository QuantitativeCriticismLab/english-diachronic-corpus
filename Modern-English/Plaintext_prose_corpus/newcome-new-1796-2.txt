<P_12,1J>

Six days then before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus
was, that had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.  Upon which
a supper was made for him there; and Martha served: and Lazarus was one
of those that were at the table with him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.2

Then Mary took a pound of very precious ointment of liquid nard,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.3

and anointed the feet of Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.4

and wiped his feet with her hair: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.5

and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.6

Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, <bracket> <font> the
son <$$font> of Simon, <$$bracket> who was about to deliver him up;
"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to
the poor? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.7

Now he said this, not that he cared for the poor: but because he
was a thief, and had the purse, and carried what was put in it.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.8

Then said Jesus,"Suffer her: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.9

against the day of my embalming she hath kept this.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.10

For ye have the poor with you always: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.11

but Me ye have not always. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.12

Now a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was there:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.13

and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus
also, whom he had raised from the dead.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.14

So the chief-priests consulted that they might kill Lazarus also;
because by reason of him many of the Jews withdrew <font> from them,
<$$font> and believed in Jesus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.15

On the next day, a great multitude who were come to the feast, when they
heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.16

and went forth to meet him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.17

and cried out;"Save now; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.18

blessed <font> be <$$font> the King of Israel who cometh in the name of
the Lord. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.19

Now when Jesus had procured a young ass, he sat on it; as it is written
;"Fear not, daughter of Sion: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.20

behold, thy King cometh, sitting on the foal of an ass. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.21

Now these things his disciples understood not at first:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.22

but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things
were written of him, and <font> that <$$font> they had done these things
unto him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.23

The multitude then who were with him, bare witness that he had called
Lazarus out of <font> his <$$font> sepulchre, and raised him from
the dead.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.24

For this reason also the multitude met him; because they heard that he
had done this miracle.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.25

The Pharisees therefore said among themselves;"Perceive ye that ye
prevail nothing?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.26

behold, the world is gone after him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,1J.27

<P_12,20J>

Now certain Greeks were among those who came up to worship at the feast.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.29

So these came to Philip, that <font> was <$$font> of Bethsaida in Galilee,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.30

and besought him, saying:"Sir, we desire to see Jesus. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.31

Philip cometh NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.32

and telleth Andrew: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.33

and again, Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.34

And Jesus answered them, saying;"The hour is come that the Son of man
should be glorified.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.35

Verily verily I say unto you, Unless a grain of wheat fall into the
ground, and die, it remaineth by itself: but if it die, it bringeth
forth much produce.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.36

He that loveth his life, shall lose it; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.37

and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it to everlasting
life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.38

If any man serve me, let him follow me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.39

and, where I am, there shall my servant also be:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.40

if any man serve me, him <font> my <$$font> Father will honour.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.41

Now is my soul troubled: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.42

and what shall I say?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.43

'Father, save me from this hour. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.44

But for this cause I came to this hour.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.45

"Father, glorify thy name. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.46

Then a voice came from heaven, <font> saying <$$font>;"I have both
glorified <font> it, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.47

and will glorify <font> it <$$font> again. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.48

The multitude therefore who stood by, and heard <font> it, <$$font>
said that it thundered.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.49

Others said;"An angel spake to him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.50

Jesus answered and said;"This voice came not for my sake, but for
your sakes.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.51

Now is the judgement of this world: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.52

now the prince of this world will be cast out.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.53

And although I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all <font>
men <$$font> unto me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.54

<paren> This he said, signifying what death he was about to die.
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.55

The multitude answered him;"We have heard out of the law that Christ
continueth for ever: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.56

and how sayest thou,'The Son of man must be lifted up? '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.57

"Who is this Son of man? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.58

Then Jesus said unto them;"<font> But <$$font> a little
time <font> longer, <$$font> the light will be among you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.59

Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.60

for he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.61

While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be sons of
light. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.62

These things Jesus spake, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.63

and departed, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.64

and concealed himself from them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.65

But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed
not in him: so that the words of the prophet Isaiah were fulfilled
, which he spake, saying;"Lord, who hath believed our report?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.66

and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been made manifest? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,20J.67

Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah hath said again;
<P_12,40J>"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart;
so that they see not with <font> their <$$font> eyes, nor understand
with <font> their <$$font> heart, and turn, that I should heal them.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.68

These things Isaiah said, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.69

Nevertheless many even among the rulers believed in him;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.70

but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <font> him, <$$font>
lest they should be put out of the synagogue: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.71

for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.72

But Jesus had cried out, and said;"He who believeth in me, believeth
not in me, but in him who sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.73

And he who seeth me, seeth him who sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.74

I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in me may
not remain in darkness.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.75

And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I condemn him not:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.76

<paren> for I came not to condemn the world, but to save the world:
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.77

he who rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath that which
condemneth him: the doctrine which I have spoken, that will condemn him
in the last day.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.78

For I have not spoken of myself; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.79

but the Father who sent me, he hath given me commandment, what I should
enjoin, and what I should speak.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.80

And I know that his commandment is everlasting life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.81

what therefore I speak, I so speak as the Father hath enjoined me.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,12,40J.82

<P_13,1J>

Now, before the feast of the passover, though Jesus knew that his hour
was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, yet,
having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.84

and supper being come, <paren> the devil having already put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot, <font> the son <$$font> of Simon, to deliver him up;
<$$paren> though he knew, <font> I say, <$$font> that the Father gave all
things into his hands, and that he came from God, and was going to God;
<font> yet <$$font> he riseth from supper, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.85

and layeth aside his <font> upper <$$font> garments;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.86

and took a napkin, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.87

and girt himself.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.88

Then he poureth water into a vessel, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.89

and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe
<font> them <$$font> with the napkin with which he was girded.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.90

So he cometh to Simon Peter: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.91

<bracket> and <$$bracket> <font> Peter <$$font> saith unto him;" Master,
dost Thou wash my feet? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.92

Jesus answered and said unto him;"What I do, thou knowest not now;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.93

but thou wilt know presently.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.94

Peter saith unto him;"Thou shalt never wash my feet. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.95

Jesus answered him;"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.96

Simon Peter saith unto him;"Master, not my feet only, but <font> mine
<$$font> hands and head also. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.97

Jesus saith unto him;"He that hath bathed, needeth to wash <font> his
<$$font> feet only; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.98

and he is altogether clean: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.99

and ye are clean, but not all. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.100

For he knew who was to deliver him up: wherefore he said;"Ye are not
all clean. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.101

So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his <font> upper <$$font>
garments, and had again placed himself at table, he said unto them;"Know
ye what I have done to you?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.102

Ye call me, Teacher, and Master: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.103

and ye say well: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.104

for <font> so <$$font> I am.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.105

If I then, <font> your <$$font> Master and Teacher, have washed your feet;
Ye also ought to wash one another's feet.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.106

For I have given you an example, that Ye also may do as I have done
to you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,1J.107

<P_13,20J>

Verily verily I say unto you; The servant is not greater than his master
; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.109

nor <font> is <$$font> the messenger greater than he who sent him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.110

Since ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.111

"I speak not of you all: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.112

I know whom I have chosen: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.113

but so the scripture is fulfilled,'He that eateth bread with me, hath
lifted up his heel against me. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.114

Now I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it shall
come to pass, ye may believe that I am <font> he.  <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.115

Verily verily I say unto you; He that receiveth whom I shall send,
receiveth me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.116

and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.117

When Jesus had said thus, he was troubled in <font> his <$$font> spirit ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.118

and testified, and said;"Verily verily I say unto you, that one of you
will deliver me up. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.119

Then the disciples looked on one another, doubting of whom he spake.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.120

Now there was placed on the bosom of Jesus one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.121

Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, that he should ask who it might
be of whom <font> Jesus <$$font> spake.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.122

He then who leaned on the breast of Jesus, saith unto him;"Master,
who is it? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.123

Jesus answereth;"It is He to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped
it. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.124

And when he had dipped the sop, he giveth it to Judas Iscariot, <font>
the son <$$font> of Simon.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.125

And, after the sop, Satan entered into him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.126

Then saith Jesus unto him;"What thou doest, do quickly. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.127

Now no man at the table knew why <font> Jesus <$$font> spake this
unto him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.128

For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had
said unto him;"Buy <font> those things <$$font> which we have need
of for the feast;"or, that he should give something to the poor.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.129

He then who had received the sop, went out immediately:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.130

now it was night.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.131

When he was gone out Jesus saith;"Now is the Son of man glorified,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.132

and God is glorified by him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.133

Since God is glorified by him, God also will glorify him in himself,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.134

and will immediately glorify him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.135

<font> My <$$font> children, <font> but <$$font> a little <font> time
<$$font> longer I shall be with you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.136

Ye will seek me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.137

and, as I said to the Jews,'Whither I go, ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
come,'so I now say to you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.138

A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; that, as
I have loved you, Ye also love one another.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.139

By this all <font> men <$$font> will know that ye are my disciples,
if ye have love to one another. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.140

Simon Peter saith unto him;"Master, whither goest thou? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.141

Jesus answered him;"Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.142

but thou wilt follow <bracket> me <$$bracket> hereafter. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.143

Peter saith unto him;"Master, why $can $not {TEXT:cannot} I follow thee
<bracket> now?  <$$bracket> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.144

I will lay down my life for thy sake. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.145

Jesus answered him;"Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.146

Verily verily I say unto thee, The cock will not crow, till thou have
denied me thrice.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,13,20J.147

<P_14,1J>

Let not your heart be troubled: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.149

believe in God; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.150

believe in Me also.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.151

In my Father's house are many mansions; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.152

if <font> it were <$$font> not <font> so, <$$font> I would have told you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.153

I go to prepare a place for you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.154

And although I go and prepare a place for you, <font> yet <$$font> I will
come again, and receive you to myself; that, where I am, Ye also may be.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.155

And whither I go, ye know; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.156

and the way ye know. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.157

Thomas saith unto him;"Master, we know not whither thou goest;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.158

and how can we know the way? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.159

Jesus saith unto him;"I am the way, and the truth, and the life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.160

no man cometh to the Father but by me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.161

If ye knew me, you would know my Father also: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.162

and henceforth ye know him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.163

and see him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.164

Philip saith unto him;"Master, shew us the Father; and it sufficeth
us. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.165

Jesus saith unto him;"Have I been so long with you,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.166

and dost thou not know me, Philip?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.167

he that seeth me, seeth the Father: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.168

how then sayest thou,'Shew us the Father? ' NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.169

Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.170

the words which I speak unto you, I speak not from myself;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.171

and the Father, who abideth in me, he doeth the works.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.172

Believe me, that I <font> am <$$font> in the Father, and the Father in
me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.173

but if not, believe <bracket> me <$$bracket> for the works themselves.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.174

Verily verily I say unto you, He who believeth in me, the works
which I do he also shall do: and greater <font> works <$$font> than
these he shall do, because I go to <bracket> my <$$bracket> Father;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.175

and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do; that the Father may
be glorified in the Son.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.176

If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do <font> it.  <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.177

If ye love me, keep my commandments.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.178

And I will ask the Father; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.179

and he will give you another Comforter; that he may abide with you for
ever; <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth, whom the world $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} receive, because it discerneth him not, nor knoweth him;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.180

but ye shall know him; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.181

for he shall abide with you, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.182

and shall be in you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.183

I will not leave you destitute: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.184

I will come unto you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.185

<font> But <$$font> a little time longer, and the world shall see me no
more: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.186

but Ye shall see me: because I live, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.187

Ye also shall live.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,1J.188

<P_14,20J>

In that day ye shall know that I <font> am <$$font> in my Father, and
you in me, and I in you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.190

He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is who loveth me:

and he who loveth me, shall be loved by my Father;

and I will love him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.193

and will manifest myself to him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.194

Judas <paren> not <font> Judas <$$font> Iscariot <$$paren> saith unto

and not to the world? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.195

Jesus answered and said unto him;"If any man love me, he will keep my
words: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.196

and my Father will love him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.197

and we will come to him, and make <font> our <$$font> abode with him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.198

He who loveth me not, keepeth not my words: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.199

and yet the word which ye hear, is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.200

These things I speak unto you, while I abide with you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.201

But the Comforter, <font> even <$$font> the Holy Spirit which
the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.202

and shall bring all things to your remembrance that I have said unto you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.203

Peace I leave with you, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.204

my peace I give unto you; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.205

not as the world giveth, do I give unto you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.206

Let not your heart be troubled, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.207

nor let it be dismayed.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.208

Ye have heard that I said unto you,'I go away,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.209

and will come <font> again <$$font> unto you. '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.210

If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I go to the Father:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.211

for <bracket> my <$$bracket> Father is greater than I.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.212

And now I tell <font> it <$$font> you before it come to pass, that,
when it cometh to pass, ye may believe.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.213

Hereafter I shall not talk much with you; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.214

for the prince of the world cometh, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.215

and hath nothing in me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.216

But <font> I lay down my life <$$font> that the world may know that I
love the Father; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.217

and as the Father hath commanded me, so I do.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.218

"Rise, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.219

let us go hence.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,14,20J.220

<P_15,1J>

"I am the true vine; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.222

and my Father is the husbandman.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.223

Every branch in me which beareth not fruit, he taketh away:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.224

and every <font> branch <$$font> which beareth fruit, he pruneth, that
it may bear more fruit.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.225

Ye are now clean, through the words which I have spoken unto you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.226

Abide in me; and I <font> will abide <$$font> in you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.227

As the branch $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear fruit of itself, unless
it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, unless ye abide in me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.228

I am the vine; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.229

ye <font> are <$$font> the branches.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.230

He that abideth in me, and I in him, he beareth much fruit:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.231

for, severed from me, ye can do nothing.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.232

If a man abide not in me, he shall be cast out as a <font> severed
<$$font> branch, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.233

and shall wither: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.234

and men shall gather together <font> such branches, <$$font> and cast
<font> them <$$font> into the fire, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.235

and they shall be burned.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.236

If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.237

and it shall be done for you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.238

Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.239

so ye will be my disciples.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.240

As the Father hath loved me, so I have loved you:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.241

abide ye in my love.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.242

If ye keep my commandments, ye will abide in my love; as I
have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.243

These things I speak unto you, that my joy in you may abide, and <font>
that <$$font> your joy may be full.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.244

This is my commandment; that ye love one another, as I have loved you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.245

Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for
his friends.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.246

Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever things I command you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.247

Henceforth I call you not servants; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.248

for the servant knoweth not what his master doeth:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.249

but I call you friends; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.250

for all things which I have heard from my Father, I have made known
unto you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.251

Ye have not chosen Me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.252

but I have chosen You, and appointed you, that ye may go and bear
fruit, and <font> that <$$font> your fruit may remain: that whatever
ye shall ask the Father in my name, he may give <font> it <$$font> you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.253

"These things I command you, that ye may love one another.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.254

If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me before <font> it hated
<$$font> You.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.255

If ye were of the world, the world would love its own:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.256

but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
world, therefore the world hateth you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,1J.257

<P_15,20J>

Remember the words which I said unto you;'The servant is not greater
than his master. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.259

If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute You also:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.260

if they have kept My words, they will keep Your's also.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.261

But all these things they will do unto you on account of my name;
because they know not him who sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.262

If I had not come, and spoken unto them, they would not have had sin:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.263

but now they have no excuse for their sin.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.264

He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.265

If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they
would not have had sin: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.266

but now they have both seen, and have hated, both me and my Father.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.267

But <font> this cometh to pass, <$$font> so that the words are
fulfilled which are written in their law;'They hated me without a cause.
'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.268

"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from
the Father, he will testify of me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.269

And ye also shall testify, because ye have been with me from the
beginning.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,15,20J.270

<P_16,1J>

"These things I have spoken unto you, that ye may not offend.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.272

They will put you out of the synagogues: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.273

yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he
offereth God service.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.274

And these things they will do, because they have not known the Father,
or me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.275

But these things I have spoken unto you, that, when the time shall come ,
ye may remember that I told you of them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.276

And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was
with you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.277

But now I depart to him who sent me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.278

and none of you asketh me,'Whither goest thou?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.279

but because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled
your heart.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.280

"Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.281

It is expedient for you that I go away: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.282

for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.283

but if I go, I will send him unto you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.284

And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgement: of sin, because they believe not
in me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me
no longer; of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.285

I have still many things to say unto you; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.286

but ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear <font> them <$$font> now.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.287

However, when he cometh, <font> even <$$font> the Spirit of truth,
he will guide you into all the truth: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.288

for he will not speak of himself; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.289

but whatsoever he shall hear, <font> that <$$font> he will speak:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.290

and he will shew you things to come.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.291

He will glorify me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.292

for he will receive of mine, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.293

and will declare it unto you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.294

All things which the Father hath are mine: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.295

therefore I have said, that he will receive of mine, and will declare
it unto you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.296

A little time, and ye will not see me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.297

and again a little time, and ye will see me; because I go to the
Father. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.298

Then said <font> some <$$font> of his disciples among themselves;
"What is this which he saith unto us;'A little time, and ye will not
see me:'and again, a little time, and ye will see me:'and, 'Because I
go to the Father? 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.299

They said therefore;"What is this which he saith;'A little time?
'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.300

we know not what he speaketh. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.301

<font> Now <$$font> Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.302

and said unto them;"Do ye enquire among yourselves concerning this, that I
said;'A little time, and ye will not see me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.303

and again, a little time, and ye will see me? '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,1J.304

<P_16,20J>

"Verily verily I say unto you, that Ye will weep and lament, but the
world will rejoice: and Ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be
turned into joy.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.306

A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow, because her hour is come:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.307

but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no
more the affliction, for joy that a man is born into the world.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.308

And thus ye have sorrow now: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.309

but I will see you again, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.310

and your heart shall rejoice, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.311

and your joy no man shall take from you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.312

And in that day ye shall request nothing of me:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.313

Verily verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
name, he will give <font> it <$$font> you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.314

Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.315

ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.316

These things I have spoken to you in dark speeches:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.317

the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in dark speeches,
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.318

In that day, ye shall ask in my name: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.319

and I say not unto you that I will request the Father for you:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.320

for the Father himself loveth you, because ye love me, and believe that
I came forth from God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.321

I came forth from the Father, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.322

and am come into the world: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.323

again, I leave the world, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.324

and go to the Father. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.325

His disciples say unto him;"Lo, now thou speakest plainly,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.326

and speakest no dark speech.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.327

Now we know that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any one
should ask thee: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.328

by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.329

Jesus answered them;"Do ye now believe?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.330

Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye will be scattered
every man to his own <font> home, <$$font> and will leave me alone:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.331

and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.332

These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.333

In the world ye will have affliction: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.334

but be of good courage; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.335

I have overcome the world. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,16,20J.336

<P_17,1J>

Jesus spake these words, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.338

and lifted up his eyes to heaven, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.339

and said;"Father, the hour is come; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.340

glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given
him power over all men, that he may give everlasting life to all whom
thou hast given him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.341

And this is everlasting life, that they may know thee the only true
God, and him whom thou hast sent, <font> even <$$font> Jesus Christ.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.342

I have glorified thee on the earth: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.343

I have finished the work which thou hast given me to do.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.344

And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thyself with the glory which I
had with thee before the world was.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.345

I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of
the world: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.346

they were thine, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.347

and thou gavest them to me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.348

and they have kept thy word.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.349

Now they know that all things, whatsoever thou hast given me, are
from thee.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.350

For I have given them the words which thou gavest me;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.351

and they have received them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.352

and have surely known that I came forth from thee,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.353

and have believed that thou hast sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.354

I request for them: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.355

I request not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.356

for they are thine.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.357

And all mine are thine, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.358

and thine <font> are <$$font> mine; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.359

and I am glorified through them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.360

And now I shall be no longer in the world; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.361

but these will be in the world, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.362

and I shall go to thee.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.363

Holy Father, keep them in that name of thine which thou hast
given me; that they may be one, as we <font> are.  <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.364

While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.365

those whom thou gavest me, I have preserved; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.366

and none of them is destroyed, but the son of destruction; so that the
scripture is fulfilled.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.367

But now I go to thee, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.368

and I speak these things in the world, that they may have my joy <font>
on their account <$$font> completed in them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.369

I have given them thy words; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.370

and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, as I
am not of the world.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.371

I request not that thou wouldest take them $out {TEXT:out_out}
of the world, but that thou wouldest keep them from evil.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.372

They are not of the world; as I am not of the world.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.373

Sanctify them through thy truth: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.374

thy word is truth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.375

As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.376

And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified
through the truth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,1J.377

<P_17,20J>

"Nor do I request for these only, but for those also who <font> shall
<$$font> believe in me through their words; that all may be one; that
as thou Father, <font> art <$$font> in me, and I in thee, they also may
be <bracket> one <$$bracket> in us: that the world may believe that thou
hast sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.379

And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may
be one, as we are one; I in them, and thou in me; that they may be
perfected in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me,
and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.380

Father, I desire that those also, whom thou hast given me, may be with
me where I shall be; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast
given me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.381

for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.382

O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.383

but I have known thee, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.384

and these have known that thou hast sent me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.385

And I have made known unto them thy name, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.386

and will make <font> it <$$font> known: that the love with which thou hast
loved me may be in them, and I in them. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,17,20J.387

<P_18,1J>

When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over
the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he and his disciples
entered.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.389

And Judas also, who delivered him up, knew the place:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.390

for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.391

Judas then, having received a band <font> of soldiers, <$$font> and
officers from the chief-priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with
lanterns, and lamps, and weapons.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.392

Upon this Jesus, knowing all things which were to befal him, went forth,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.393

and said unto them;"Whom seek ye? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.394

They answered him;"Jesus of Nazareth. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.395

Jesus saith unto them;"I am <font> he.  <$$font>"
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.396

And Judas also, who delivered him up, stood with them.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.397

As soon then as he had said unto them,'I am <font> he, <$$font> 'they
went backward, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.398

and fell on the ground.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.399

Then he asked them again;"Whom seek ye? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.400

And they said;"Jesus of Nazareth. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.401

Jesus answered;"I have told you that I am <font> he: <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.402

if therefore ye seek me, let these depart. "<paren> That the words might
be fulfilled, which he spake;"Of those whom thou gavest me, I have lost
none. "<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.403

Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.404

and struck a servant of the high-priest, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.405

and cut off his right ear.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.406

Now the servant's name was Malchus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.407

Then said Jesus to Peter;"Put up the sword into the sheath:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.408

the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.409

Then the band, and the commander, and the officers of the Jews, took
Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.410

and bound him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.411

and led him away to Annas first; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.412

for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.413

Now Caiaphas was he who had given counsel to the Jews, that
it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.414

And Simon Peter followed Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.415

and <font> so did <$$font> another disciple: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.416

and that disciple was known to the high-priest,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.417

and entered with Jesus into the palace of the high-priest.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.418

But Peter stood at the door without.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.419

Then that other disciple, who was known to the high-priest, went out,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.420

and spake to her who kept the door, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.421

and brought in Peter.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.422

Then the maid-servant who kept the door saith to Peter;"Art
not Thou also <font> one <$$font> of this man's disciples? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.423

He saith;"I am not. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.424

And the servants and officers stood NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.425

and warmed themselves, having made a fire of coals;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.426

for it was cold.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.427

And Peter stood with them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.428

and warmed himself.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.429

Now the high-priest asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,1J.430

<P_18,20J>

Jesus answered him;"I have spoken openly to the world;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.432

I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all
the Jews resort; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.433

and in secret I have spoken nothing.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.434

Why askest thou Me?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.435

ask those that heard me, what I have spoken to them:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.436

behold, they know what I have said. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.437

And when he had said these words, one of the officers who stood by struck
Jesus with the palm of his hand, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.438

and said;"Answerest thou the high-priest thus? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.439

Jesus answered him;"If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.440

but if well, why dost thou smite me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.441

<paren> <font> Now <$$font> Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the
high-priest.  <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.442

And Simon Peter stood NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.443

and warmed himself.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.444

Then they said to him;"Art not Thou also one of his disciples?
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.445

He denied <font> it, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.446

and said;"I am not. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.447

One of the servants of the high-priest, being the kinsman of him whose
ear Peter cut off, saith;"Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.448

Peter then denied it again; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.449

and immediately the cock crew.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.450

<bracket> Then <$$bracket> <font> the Jews <$$font> bring Jesus from
Caiaphas, to the judgement-hall; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.451

and it was early: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.452

and they themselves went not into the judgement-hall, lest
they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.453

Pilate therefore went out unto them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.454

and said;"What accusation bring ye against this man? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.455

They answered and said unto him;"If he were not a malefactor, we would
not have delivered him up unto thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.456

Then Pilate said unto them;"Take Ye him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.457

and judge him according to your law. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.458

The Jews therefore said unto him;"We are not allowed to put any
man to death. "<paren> So that the words of Jesus were fulfilled ,
which he spake, signifying what death he was to die.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.459

Then Pilate entered again into the judgement-hall,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.460

and called Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.461

and said unto him;"Art thou the king of the Jews? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.462

Jesus answered <bracket> him; <$$bracket>"Sayest thou this of thyself ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.463

or have others told it thee of me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.464

Pilate answered;"Am I a Jew?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.465

Thine own nation, and the chief-priests, have delivered thee up unto me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.466

What hast thou done? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.467

Jesus answered;"My kingdom is not of this world.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.468

If my kingdom had been of this world, then my servants would
have contended, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.469

but indeed my kingdom is not hence. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.470

Pilate therefore said unto him;"Art thou a king then? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.471

Jesus answered;"Thou sayest <font> truly <$$font> that I am a king.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.472

For this cause I was born, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.473

and for this cause I came into the world, that I might bear witness to
the truth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.474

Every one that is of the truth, hearkeneth to my voice. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.475

Pilate saith unto him;"What is truth? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.476

And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.477

and saith unto them;"I find no fault in him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.478

But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.479

will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,20J.480

<P_18,40J>

Then all cried out <bracket> in their turn, <$$bracket> saying; "Not
this man, but Barabbas. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,40J.482

Now Barabbas was a robber.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,18,40J.483

<P_19,1J>

Then Pilate upon this took Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.485

and scourged <font> him.  <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.486

And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.487

and put it on his head; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.488

and they clothed him with a purple garment, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.489

and said;"Hail, King of the Jews. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.490

And they struck him with the palms of their hands.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.491

<font> Then <$$font> Pilate went out again, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.492

and saith unto them;"See, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that
I find no fault in him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.493

Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple garment.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.494

And <font> Pilate <$$font> saith unto them;"See, the man. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.495

When therefore the chief-priests and the officers saw him, they cried
out , saying;"Crucify <font> him, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.496

crucify him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.497

Pilate saith unto them;"Take Ye him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.498

and crucify <font> him: <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.499

for I find no fault in him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.500

The Jews answered him;"We have a law, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.501

and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself <font> the
<$$font> son of God. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.502

When Pilate therefore heard these words, he was the more afraid;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.503

and went again into the judgement-hall, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.504

and saith to Jesus;"Whence art thou? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.505

But Jesus gave him no answer.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.506

Pilate saith to him;"Speakest thou not to Me?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.507

knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to
release thee? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.508

Jesus answered;"Thou couldest have no power against me, unless it had
been given thee from above: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.509

concerning this matter, he that delivered me up unto thee hath greater
sin. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.510

Thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.511

but the Jews cried out, saying;"If thou release this man, thou art not
Cesar's friend.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.512

Whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cesar. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.513

When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.514

and sat down on the judgement-seat, in a place which is called the
Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.515

<paren> now it was the Preparation-day {COM:"day"_in_italics} of the
passover, and about the third hour: <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.516

and he saith unto the Jews;"See, your King. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.517

But they cried out;"Destroy <font> him, <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.518

destroy <font> him, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.519

crucify him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.520

Pilate saith unto them;"Shall I crucify your King? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.521

The chief-priests answered;"We have no king but Cesar. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.522

Then upon this <font> Pilate <$$font> delivered him up unto them to
be crucified.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.523

And they took Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.524

and led him away.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.525

And he, carrying his cross, went out to a place called, <font> The
place <$$font> of skulls; which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha;
where they crucified him, and two others with him, on each side one,
and Jesus in the midst.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.526

And Pilate wrote a title also, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.527

and put it on the cross: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.528

and the writing was, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,1J.529

<P_19,20J>

And many of the Jews read this title: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.531

for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.532

and it was written in Hebrew, <font> and <$$font> Greek, <font> and
<$$font> Latin.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.533

Upon this the chief-priests of the Jews said to Pilate;"Write not,
'The King of the Jews;'but that he said,'I am King of the Jews.
'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.534

Pilate answered;"What I have written, I have written"
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.535

Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his <font> outer
<$$font> garments, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.536

and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and <font> his <$$font>
vest also: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.537

now the vest was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.538

They said therefore among themselves;"Let us not rend it, but cast lots
for it, whose it shall be. "So that the scripture was fulfilled, which
saith;"They divided my garments among them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.539

and for my vesture they cast lots. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.540

These things therefore the soldiers did.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.541

Now his mother stood by the cross of Jesus, and his mother's sister
, Mary <font> the wife <$$font> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.542

When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple
{COM:low_attachment;_cf._Greek_original} standing by whom
he loved, he saith to his mother;"Woman, behold, thy son. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.543

Then he saith to the disciple;"Behold, thy mother. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.544

And from that hour the disciple took her to his own <font> home.  <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.545

After this Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished,
that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith;"I thirst. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.546

Now a vessel was set, full of vinegar.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.547

And some filled a spunge with vinegar, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.548

and put it upon hyssop, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.549

and raised it to his mouth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.550

When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said;"It is finished
:"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.551

and he bowed his head, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.552

and yielded up <font> his <$$font> spirit.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.553

The Jews therefore, because it was the <font> day of <$$font> Preparation
, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, <paren>
for that sabbath was a great day, <$$paren> besought Pilate that their
legs might be broken, and <font> that <$$font> they might be taken away.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.554

Then the soldiers came, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.555

and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified
with <font> Jesus: <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.556

but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
brake not his legs: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.557

but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.558

and immediately there came out blood and water.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.559

And he who saw <font> these things <$$font> beareth witness; <paren>
and his witness is true, and he knoweth that he saith truly; <$$paren>
that ye also may believe.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.560

For these things were done, so that the scripture was fulfilled;
"A bone of it shall not be broken. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.561

And again another <font> part of <$$font> scripture saith;"They shall
look on him whom they pierced. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.562

<bracket> Now <$$bracket> after this, Joseph of Arimathea, <paren>
being a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed one for fear of the Jews,
<$$paren> besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.563

and Pilate gave <font> him <$$font> leave.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.564

He came therefore, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.565

and took the body of Jesus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.566

And Nicodemus also came, <paren> he that at first had come to Jesus by
night, <$$paren> bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about <font>
the weight of <$$font> an hundred pounds.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,20J.567

<P_19,40J>

Then they took the body of Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.569

and wound it in linen bands with the spices, as the manner of the Jews
is to embalm.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.570

Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and
in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no man had ever been laid,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.571

There they laid Jesus therefore, because of the Preparation <font>
day <$$font> of the Jews; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.572

for the sepulchre was near.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,19,40J.573

<P_20,1J>

But <font> on <$$font> the first <font> day <$$font> of the week Mary
Magdalene cometh to the sepulchre in the morning, when it was yet dark,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.575

and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.576

She runneth therefore, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.577

and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.578

and saith unto them;"They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.579

and we know not where they have laid him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.580

Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.581

and they came to the sepulchre.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.582

Now they both ran together: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.583

but the other disciple outran Peter, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.584

and came first to the sepulchre.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.585

And when he had stooped down to look in, he seeth the linen bands lying ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.586

but he went not in.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.587

Then cometh Simon Peter, following him; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.588

and he went into the sepulchre, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.589

and seeth the linen bands lying; and the napkin, which had been about
<font> Jesus's <$$font> head, not lying with the linen bands, but wrapped
up apart in another place.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.590

Then went in that other disciple also, who came first to the sepulchre;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.591

and he saw NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.592

and believed not.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.593

For as yet they knew not the scripture, that <font> Jesus <$$font>
must rise again from the dead.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.594

Then the disciples went again to their own home.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.595

But Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.596

and, as she wept, she stooped down to look into the sepulchre;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.597

and seeth two angels in white, sitting, one at the head and the other at
the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.598

And they say unto her;"Woman, why weepest thou?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.599

She saith unto them;"Because they have taken away my Lord,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.600

and I know not where they have laid him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.601

When she had said thus, she turned <font> herself <$$font> back,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.602

and seeth Jesus standing; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.603

but knew not that it was Jesus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.604

Jesus saith unto her;"Woman, why weepest thou?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.605

whom seekest thou? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.606

She, supposing him to be the keeper of the garden, saith unto him;
"Sir, if thou have carried him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him,
and I will take him away. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.607

Jesus saith unto her;"Mary. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.608

She turned, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.609

and saith unto him in the Hebrew tongue;"Rabboni. "Which signifieth
, Master.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.610

Jesus saith unto her;"Embrace me not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.611

for I do not yet ascend to my Father: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.612

but go to my brethren, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.613

and say unto them;'I <font> shall <$$font> ascend to my Father
and your Father, and <font> to <$$font> my God and your God. '
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.614

Mary Magdalene cometh NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.615

and telleth the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had
said these things unto her.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.616

Then in the evening of that day, being the first <font> day <$$font>
of the week, the doors having been shut, for fear of the Jews, where
the disciples were assembled, Jesus came NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.617

and stood in the midst, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.618

and saith unto them;"Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,1J.619

<P_20,20J>

And when he had said this, he shewed them <font> his <$$font> hands and
his side.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.621

Then the disciples were glad, when they saw the Lord.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.622

Then Jesus said to them again;"Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.623

as the Father sent me, so I send you. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.624

And when he had said this, he breathed on <font> them, <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.625

and saith unto them;"Receive ye the Holy Spirit.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.626

If ye remit the sins of any, they are remitted unto them
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.627

if ye retain <font> them, <$$font> they are retained. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.628

But Thomas, called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with them when
Jesus came.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.629

Then the other disciples said unto him;"We have seen the Lord.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.630

But he said unto them;"Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put mine hand
into his side, I shall not believe. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.631

And, within eight days, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with
them: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.632

<font> then <$$font> Jesus cometh, the doors having been shut,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.633

and stood in the midst, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.634

and said;"Peace <font> be <$$font> unto you. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.635

Then he saith to Thomas;"Reach hither thy finger,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.636

and behold my hands; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.637

and reach hither thine hand, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.638

and put it into my side; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.639

and be not unbelieving, but believing. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.640

Thomas answered, and said unto him;"My Lord, and my God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.641

Jesus saith unto him;"Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.642

happy <font> are <$$font> they that have not seen, and <font> yet <$$font>
have believed. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.643

Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which
are not written in this book: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.644

but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God; and that, believing, ye may have life through his name.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,20,20J.645

<P_21,1J>

After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the
lake of Tiberias: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.647

and in this manner he shewed <font> himself.  <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.648

There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael
of Cana in Galilee, and <font> the sons <$$font> of Zebedee, and two
others of his disciples.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.649

Simon Peter saith unto them;"I am going to fish. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.650

They say unto him;"We also <font> will <$$font> go with thee.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.651

They departed, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.652

and went into a ship immediately; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.653

and on that night they caught nothing.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.654

But when morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.655

the disciples however knew not that it was Jesus.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.656

Then Jesus saith unto them;"<font> My <$$font> children, have ye any
food? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.657

They answered him,"No. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.658

And he said unto them; Cast the net on the right side of the ship,
and ye will get <font> some.  <$$font>"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.659

They cast <font> it <$$font> therefore: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.660

and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.
Wherefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter:"It is the
Lord. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.661

Now, when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt on <font>
his <$$font> upper garment, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.662

<paren> for he was naked, <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.663

and cast himself into the lake.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.664

And the other disciples came in the vessel, <paren> for they were not
far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits, <$$paren> dragging
the net <font> full <$$font> of fishes.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.665

As soon then as they landed, they see a fire of coals lying, and fish
laid thereon; and bread.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.666

Jesus saith unto them;"Bring of the fishes which ye have now caught.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.667

Simon Peter went <font> into the vessel, <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.668

and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty three:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.669

and although there were so many, yet the net was not broken.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.670

Jesus saith unto them;"Come <font> and <$$font> dine. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.671

Now none of the disciples durst enquire of him,"Who art thou?
"knowing that it was the Lord.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.672

Jesus <bracket> then <$$bracket> cometh, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.673

and taketh bread, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.674

and giveth to them, and fish in like manner.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.675

Jesus shewed himself to his disciples now this third time, after he had
risen from the dead.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.676

So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter;"Simon, <font>
son <$$font> of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these <font> love me?
"<$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.677

He saith unto <font> Jesus; <$$font>"Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love
thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.678

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him;"Feed my lambs. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.679

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith to him again a second time;"Simon, <font>
son <$$font> of Jonah, lovest thou me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.680

He saith unto <font> Jesus; <$$font>"Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love
thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.681

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him;"Tend my sheep. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.682

<font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him the third time; Simon, <font>
son <$$font> of Jonah, lovest thou me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.683

Peter was grieved that <font> Jesus <$$font> said unto him the third
time,"Lovest thou me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.684

and he said unto <font> Jesus <$$font>;"Lord, thou knowest all things ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.685

thou knowest that I love thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.686

Jesus saith unto him;"Feed my sheep.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.687

Verily verily I say unto thee; When thou wast young, thou didst
gird thyself and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt
be old, thou wilt stretch forth thine hands, and another will gird
thee, and carry <font> thee <$$font> whither thou wouldest not.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.688

Now he spake this, signifying by what death <font> Peter <$$font> would
glorify God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.689

And when he had spoken this, he saith to <font> Peter <$$font>; "Follow
me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,1J.690

<P_21,20J>

Then Peter turned about, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.692

and seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who had leaned on his
breast also at supper, and had said;"Lord, which is he who delivereth
thee up? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.693

When Peter saw him, he saith to Jesus;"Lord, and what <font> shall
<$$font> this man <font> do?  <$$font>"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.694

Jesus saith unto him;"If I will that he remain till I come, what <font>
is that <$$font> to thee?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.695

Follow Thou me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.696

This report therefore went abroad among the brethren, that this disciple
should not die: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.697

yet Jesus said not to him;"He shall not die;"but,"If I will that
he remain till I come, what <font> is that <$$font> to thee?
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.698

This is the disciple who testified of these things, and wrote these
things: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.699

and we know that his testimony is true.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.700

And there are many other things also that Jesus did, which, if
they were written every one, I think that even the world itself
could not contain the books <font> which would be <$$font> written.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-2,21,20J.701
