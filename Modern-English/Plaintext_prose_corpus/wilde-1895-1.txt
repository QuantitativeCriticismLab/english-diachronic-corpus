Second Act WILDE-1895-1,39.3

Scene <font> Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern's house.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,39.4

<$$heading>

<font> Lord Goring, dressed in the height of fashion, is lounging in
an armchair.  WILDE-1895-1,39.6

Sir Robert Chiltern is standing in front of the fireplace.
WILDE-1895-1,39.7

He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress.
WILDE-1895-1,39.8

As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room.
<$$font> WILDE-1895-1,39.9

Lord Goring: My dear Robert, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a very awkward business ,
very awkward indeed.  WILDE-1895-1,39.10

You should have told your wife the whole thing.  WILDE-1895-1,39.11

Secrets from other people's wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.
WILDE-1895-1,39.12

So, at least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough
to know better.  WILDE-1895-1,39.13

But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  WILDE-1895-1,39.14

She invariably finds it out.  WILDE-1895-1,39.15

Women have a wonderful instinct about things.  WILDE-1895-1,39.16

They can discover everything except the obvious.  WILDE-1895-1,39.17

Sir Robert Chiltern: Arthur, I $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} tell my wife.
WILDE-1895-1,39.18

When could I have told her?  WILDE-1895-1,39.19

Not last night.  WILDE-1895-1,39.20

It would have made a life-long separation between us, WILDE-1895-1,39.21

and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world I worship,
of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  WILDE-1895-1,39.22

Last night it would have been quite impossible.  WILDE-1895-1,39.23

<P_40>

She would have turned from me in horror...  in horror and in contempt.
WILDE-1895-1,40.25

Lord Goring: Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?  WILDE-1895-1,40.26

Sir Robert Chiltern: Yes, my wife is as perfect as all that.
WILDE-1895-1,40.27

Lord Goring <font> taking off his left-hand glove <$$font>: What a pity!
WILDE-1895-1,40.28

I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, WILDE-1895-1,40.29

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} quite mean that.  WILDE-1895-1,40.30

But if what you tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk
about life with Lady Chiltern.  WILDE-1895-1,40.31

Sir Robert Chiltern: It would be quite useless.  WILDE-1895-1,40.32

Lord Goring: May I try?  WILDE-1895-1,40.33

Sir Robert Chiltern: Yes; WILDE-1895-1,40.34

but nothing could make her alter her views.  WILDE-1895-1,40.35

Lord Goring: Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
experiment.  WILDE-1895-1,40.36

Sir Robert Chiltern: All such experiments are terribly dangerous.
WILDE-1895-1,40.37

Lord Goring: Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  WILDE-1895-1,40.38

If it $was $n't {TEXT:wasn't} so, life $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't}
be worth living... .  WILDE-1895-1,40.39

Well, I am bound to say that I think you should have told her years ago.
WILDE-1895-1,40.40

Sir Robert Chiltern: When?  WILDE-1895-1,40.41

When we were engaged?  WILDE-1895-1,40.42

Do you think she would have married me if she had known that the origin
of my fortune is such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is,
and that I had done a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful
and dishonourable?  WILDE-1895-1,40.43

Lord Goring <font> slowly <$$font>: Yes; most men would call it ugly
names.  WILDE-1895-1,40.44

There is no doubt of that.  WILDE-1895-1,40.45

<P_41>

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> bitterly <$$font>: Men who every day do
something of the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them,
have worse secrets in their own lives.  WILDE-1895-1,41.47

Lord Goring: That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
people's secrets.  WILDE-1895-1,41.48

It distracts public attention from their own.  WILDE-1895-1,41.49

Sir Robert Chiltern: And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?
WILDE-1895-1,41.50

No one.  WILDE-1895-1,41.51

Lord Goring <font> looking at him steadily <$$font>: Except yourself,
Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,41.52

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> after a pause <$$font>: Of course I had private
information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government
of the day, WILDE-1895-1,41.53

and I acted on it.  WILDE-1895-1,41.54

Private information is practically the source of every large modern
fortune.  Lord Goring <font> tapping his boot with his $cane {TEXT:came}
<$$font>: And public scandal invariably the result.  WILDE-1895-1,41.55

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> pacing up and down the room <$$font>: Arthur,
do you think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought
up against me now?  WILDE-1895-1,41.56

Do you think it fair that a man's whole career should be ruined for a
fault done in one's boyhood almost?  WILDE-1895-1,41.57

I was twenty-two at the time, WILDE-1895-1,41.58

and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
unforgivable things nowadays.  WILDE-1895-1,41.59

Is it fair that the folly, the sin of one's youth, if men choose to call
it a sin, should wreck a life like mine, should place me in the pillory,
should shatter all that I have worked for, all that I have built up?
WILDE-1895-1,41.60

Is it fair, Arthur?  WILDE-1895-1,41.61

Lord Goring: Life is never fair, Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,41.62

And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.
WILDE-1895-1,41.63

Sir Robert Chiltern: Every man of ambition has to fight his century with
its own weapons.  WILDE-1895-1,41.64

What this century worships is wealth.  WILDE-1895-1,41.65

<P_42>

The god of this century is wealth.  WILDE-1895-1,42.67

To succeed one must have wealth.  WILDE-1895-1,42.68

At all costs one must have wealth.  WILDE-1895-1,42.69

Lord Goring: You underrate yourself, Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,42.70

Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well.
WILDE-1895-1,42.71

Sir Robert Chiltern: When I was old, perhaps.  WILDE-1895-1,42.72

When I had lost my passion for power, or could not use it.
WILDE-1895-1,42.73

When I was tired, worn out, disappointed.  WILDE-1895-1,42.74

I wanted my success when I was young.  WILDE-1895-1,42.75

Youth is the time for success.  WILDE-1895-1,42.76

I $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} wait.  WILDE-1895-1,42.77

Lord Goring: Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
still young.  WILDE-1895-1,42.78

No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.  WILDE-1895-1,42.79

Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty - $that $'s
{TEXT:that's} good enough for anyone, I should think.  WILDE-1895-1,42.80

Sir Robert Chiltern: And if it is all taken away from me now?
WILDE-1895-1,42.81

If I lose everything over a horrible scandal?  WILDE-1895-1,42.82

If I am hounded from public life?  WILDE-1895-1,42.83

Lord Goring: Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?
WILDE-1895-1,42.84

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> excitedly <$$font>: I did not sell myself
for money.  WILDE-1895-1,42.85

I bought success at a great price.  WILDE-1895-1,42.86

That is all.  WILDE-1895-1,42.87

Lord Goring <font> gravely <$$font>: Yes; you certainly paid a great
price for it.  WILDE-1895-1,42.88

But what first made you think of doing such a thing?  WILDE-1895-1,42.89

Sir Robert Chiltern: Baron Arnheim.  WILDE-1895-1,42.90

Lord Goring: Damned scoundrel!  WILDE-1895-1,42.91

Sir Robert Chiltern: No; he was a man of a most subtle and refined
intellect.  A man of culture, charm, and distinction.  One of the most
intellectual men I ever met.  WILDE-1895-1,42.92

<P_43>

Lord Goring: Ah!  I prefer a gentlemanly fool any day.  WILDE-1895-1,43.94

There is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine.
WILDE-1895-1,43.95

Personally, I have a great admiration for stupidity.  WILDE-1895-1,43.96

It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose.  WILDE-1895-1,43.97

But how did he do it?  WILDE-1895-1,43.98

Tell me the whole thing.  WILDE-1895-1,43.99

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> throws himself into an armchair by the
writing-table <$$font>: WILDE-1895-1,43.100

One night after dinner at Lord Radley's the Baron began talking about
success in modern life as something that one could reduce to an absolutely
definite science.  WILDE-1895-1,43.101

With that wonderfully fascinating quiet voice of his he expounded to
us the most terrible of all philosophies, the philosophy of power,
WILDE-1895-1,43.102

preached to us the most marvellous of all gospels, the gospel of gold.
WILDE-1895-1,43.103

I think he saw the effect he had produced on me, WILDE-1895-1,43.104

for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come and see him.
WILDE-1895-1,43.105

He was living then in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb has now.
WILDE-1895-1,43.106

I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale, curved lips,
he led me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me his tapestries
, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me wonder at the
strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and then told me
that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in a play ,
and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was the one
thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy
one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich possessed it.
WILDE-1895-1,43.107

Lord Goring <font> with great deliberation <$$font>: A thoroughly
shallow creed.  WILDE-1895-1,43.108

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> rising <$$font>: I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}
think so then.  WILDE-1895-1,43.109

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think so now.  WILDE-1895-1,43.110

Wealth has given me enormous power.  WILDE-1895-1,43.111

It gave me at the very outset of my life freedom, WILDE-1895-1,43.112

and freedom is everything.  WILDE-1895-1,43.113

You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.
WILDE-1895-1,43.114

You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} understand what a wonderful chance the Baron
gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.  WILDE-1895-1,43.115

Lord Goring: Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.
WILDE-1895-1,43.116

But tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to -
well, to do what you did?  WILDE-1895-1,43.117

<P_44>

Sir Robert Chiltern: When I was going away he said to me that if I ever
could give him any private information of real value he would make me
a very rich man.  WILDE-1895-1,44.119

I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, WILDE-1895-1,44.120

and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.
WILDE-1895-1,44.121

Six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands.
WILDE-1895-1,44.122

Lord Goring <font> keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the carpet <$$font>
: State documents?  WILDE-1895-1,44.123

Sir Robert Chiltern: Yes.  WILDE-1895-1,44.124

<font> Lord Goring sighs, WILDE-1895-1,44.125

then passes his hand across his forehead WILDE-1895-1,44.126

and looks up.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,44.127

Lord Goring: I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have
been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim
held out to you.  WILDE-1895-1,44.128

Sir Robert Chiltern: Weak?  WILDE-1895-1,44.129

Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick of using it about others.
WILDE-1895-1,44.130

Weak?  WILDE-1895-1,44.131

Do you really think, Arthur, that it is weakness that yields to
temptation?  WILDE-1895-1,44.132

I tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength,
strength and courage, to yield to.  WILDE-1895-1,44.133

To stake all one's life on a single moment, to risk everything on one
throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not - there is no
weakness in that.  WILDE-1895-1,44.134

There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  WILDE-1895-1,44.135

I had that courage.  WILDE-1895-1,44.136

I sat down the same afternoon WILDE-1895-1,44.137

and wrote Baron Arnheim the letter this woman now holds.
WILDE-1895-1,44.138

He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction.
WILDE-1895-1,44.139

Lord Goring: And you?  WILDE-1895-1,44.140

Sir Robert Chiltern: I received from the Baron +L110,000.
WILDE-1895-1,44.141

Lord Goring: You were worth more, Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,44.142

<P_45>

Sir Robert Chiltern: No; WILDE-1895-1,45.144

that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power over others.
WILDE-1895-1,45.145

I went into the House immediately.  WILDE-1895-1,45.146

The Baron advised me in finance from time to time.  WILDE-1895-1,45.147

Before five years I had almost trebled my fortune.  WILDE-1895-1,45.148

Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a success.
WILDE-1895-1,45.149

In all things connected with money I have had a luck so extraordinary
that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  WILDE-1895-1,45.150

I remember having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the
gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.  WILDE-1895-1,45.151

Lord Goring: But tell me, Robert, did you ever suffer any regret for
what you had done?  WILDE-1895-1,45.152

Sir Robert Chiltern: No.  WILDE-1895-1,45.153

I felt that I had fought the century with its own weapons, and won.
WILDE-1895-1,45.154

Lord Goring <font> sadly <$$font>: You thought you had won.
WILDE-1895-1,45.155

Sir Robert Chiltern: I thought so.  WILDE-1895-1,45.156

<font> After a long pause.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,45.157

Arthur, do you despise me for what I have told you?  WILDE-1895-1,45.158

Lord Goring <font> with deep feeling in his voice <$$font>: I am very
sorry for you, Robert, very sorry indeed.  WILDE-1895-1,45.159

Sir Robert Chiltern: I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} say that I suffered any
remorse.  WILDE-1895-1,45.160

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}.  WILDE-1895-1,45.161

Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.
WILDE-1895-1,45.162

But I have paid conscience money many times.  WILDE-1895-1,45.163

I had a wild hope that I might disarm destiny.  WILDE-1895-1,45.164

The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in public
charities since then.  WILDE-1895-1,45.165

Lord Goring <font> looking up <$$font>: In public charities?
WILDE-1895-1,45.166

Dear me!  WILDE-1895-1,45.167

what a lot of harm you must have done, Robert!  WILDE-1895-1,45.168

Sir Robert Chiltern: Oh, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} say that, Arthur;
WILDE-1895-1,45.169

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} talk like that!  WILDE-1895-1,45.170

<P_46>

Lord Goring: Never mind what I say, Robert!  WILDE-1895-1,46.172

I am always saying what I $should $n't {TEXT:shouldn't} say.
WILDE-1895-1,46.173

In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A great mistake nowadays.
WILDE-1895-1,46.174

It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  WILDE-1895-1,46.175

As regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I can.
WILDE-1895-1,46.176

Of course, you know that.  WILDE-1895-1,46.177

Sir Robert Chiltern: Thank you, Arthur, WILDE-1895-1,46.178

thank you.  WILDE-1895-1,46.179

But what is to be done?  WILDE-1895-1,46.180

What can be done?  WILDE-1895-1,46.181

Lord Goring <font> leaning back with his hands in his pockets <$$font>
: Well, the English $can $n't {TEXT:can't} stand a man who is always
saying he is in the right, WILDE-1895-1,46.182

but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong.
WILDE-1895-1,46.183

It is one of the best things in them.  WILDE-1895-1,46.184

However, in your case, Robert, a confession would not do.
WILDE-1895-1,46.185

The money, if you will allow me to say so, is...  awkward.
WILDE-1895-1,46.186

Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the whole affair, you would
never be able to talk morality again.  WILDE-1895-1,46.187

And in England a man who $can $n't {TEXT:can't} talk morality twice a
week to a large, popular, immoral audience is quite over as a serious
politician.  WILDE-1895-1,46.188

There would be nothing left for him as a profession except Botany or
the Church.  WILDE-1895-1,46.189

A confession would be of no use.  WILDE-1895-1,46.190

It would ruin you.  WILDE-1895-1,46.191

Sir Robert Chiltern: It would ruin me.  WILDE-1895-1,46.192

Arthur, the only thing for me to do now is to fight the thing out.
WILDE-1895-1,46.193

Lord Goring <font> rising from his chair <$$font>: I was waiting for
you to say that, Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,46.194

It is the only thing to do now.  WILDE-1895-1,46.195

And you must begin by telling your wife the whole story.
WILDE-1895-1,46.196

Sir Robert Chiltern: That I will not do.  WILDE-1895-1,46.197

Lord Goring: Robert, believe me, you are wrong.  WILDE-1895-1,46.198

Sir Robert Chiltern: I $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} do it.
WILDE-1895-1,46.199

It would kill her love for me.  WILDE-1895-1,46.200

And now about this woman, this Mrs Cheveley.  How can I defend myself
against her?  WILDE-1895-1,46.201

You knew her before, Arthur, apparently.  WILDE-1895-1,46.202

<P_47>

Lord Goring: Yes.  WILDE-1895-1,47.204

Sir Robert Chiltern: Did you know her well?  WILDE-1895-1,47.205

Lord Goring <font> arranging his necktie <$$font>: So little that I got
engaged to be married to her once, when I was staying at the Tenbys'.
WILDE-1895-1,47.206

The affair lasted for three days...  nearly.  WILDE-1895-1,47.207

Sir Robert Chiltern: Why was it broken off?  WILDE-1895-1,47.208

Lord Goring <font> airily <$$font>: Oh, I forget.  WILDE-1895-1,47.209

At least, it makes no matter.  WILDE-1895-1,47.210

By the way, have you tried her with money?  WILDE-1895-1,47.211

She used to be confoundedly fond of money.  WILDE-1895-1,47.212

Sir Robert Chiltern: I offered her any sum she wanted.
WILDE-1895-1,47.213

She refused.  WILDE-1895-1,47.214

Lord Goring: Then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down sometimes.
WILDE-1895-1,47.215

The rich $can $n't {TEXT:can't} do everything, after all.
WILDE-1895-1,47.216

Sir Robert Chiltern: Not everything.  WILDE-1895-1,47.217

I suppose you are right.  WILDE-1895-1,47.218

Arthur, I feel that public disgrace is in store for me.
WILDE-1895-1,47.219

I feel certain of it.  WILDE-1895-1,47.220

I never knew what terror was before.  WILDE-1895-1,47.221

I know it now.  WILDE-1895-1,47.222

It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one's heart.  WILDE-1895-1,47.223

It is as if one's heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow.
WILDE-1895-1,47.224

Lord Goring <font> striking the table <$$font>: Robert, you must
fight her.  WILDE-1895-1,47.225

You must fight her.  WILDE-1895-1,47.226

Sir Robert Chiltern: But how?  WILDE-1895-1,47.227

Lord Goring: I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} tell you how at present.
WILDE-1895-1,47.228

I have not the smallest idea.  WILDE-1895-1,47.229

But everyone has some weak point.  WILDE-1895-1,47.230

There is some flaw in each one of us.  WILDE-1895-1,47.231

<font> Strolls over to the fireplace WILDE-1895-1,47.232

and looks at himself in the glass.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,47.233

My father tells me that even I have faults.  WILDE-1895-1,47.234

Perhaps I have.  WILDE-1895-1,47.235

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know.  WILDE-1895-1,47.236

<P_48>

Sir Robert Chiltern: In defending myself against Mrs Cheveley, I have
a right to use any weapon I can find, have I not?  WILDE-1895-1,48.238

Lord Goring <font> still looking in the glass <$$font>: In your place
I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think I should have the smallest scruple in
doing so.  WILDE-1895-1,48.239

She is thoroughly well able to take care of herself.  WILDE-1895-1,48.240

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> sits down at the table WILDE-1895-1,48.241

and takes a pen in his hand <$$font>: WILDE-1895-1,48.242

Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna to inquire
if there is anything known against her.  WILDE-1895-1,48.243

There may be some secret scandal she might be afraid of.
WILDE-1895-1,48.244

Lord Goring <font> settling his buttonhole <$$font>: Oh, I should fancy
Mrs Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a
new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park
every afternoon at five-thirty.  WILDE-1895-1,48.245

I am sure she adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at
present is that she $can $n't {TEXT:can't} manage to have enough of them.
WILDE-1895-1,48.246

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> writing <$$font>: Why do you say that?
WILDE-1895-1,48.247

Lord Goring <font> turning round <$$font>: Well, she wore far too much
rouge last night, and not quite enough clothes.  WILDE-1895-1,48.248

That is always a sign of despair in a woman.  WILDE-1895-1,48.249

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> striking a bell <$$font>: But it is worth
while my wiring to Vienna, is it not?  WILDE-1895-1,48.250

Lord Goring: It is always worth while asking a question, though it is
not always worth while answering one.  WILDE-1895-1,48.251

<font> Enter Mason.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,48.252

Sir Robert Chiltern: Is Mr. Trafford in his room?
WILDE-1895-1,48.253

Mason: Yes, Sir Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,48.254

<P_49>

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> puts what he has written into an envelope,
which he then carefully closes <$$font>: WILDE-1895-1,49.256

Tell him to have this sent off in cipher at once.  WILDE-1895-1,49.257

There must not be a moment's delay.  WILDE-1895-1,49.258

Mason: Yes, Sir Robert.  WILDE-1895-1,49.259

Sir Robert Chiltern: Oh!  just give that back to me again.
WILDE-1895-1,49.260

<font> Writes something on the envelope.  WILDE-1895-1,49.261

Mason then goes out with the letter.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,49.262

Sir Robert Chiltern: She must have had some curious hold over Baron
Arnheim.  WILDE-1895-1,49.263

I wonder what it was.  WILDE-1895-1,49.264

Lord Goring <font> smiling <$$font>: I wonder.  WILDE-1895-1,49.265

Sir Robert Chiltern: I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife
knows nothing.  WILDE-1895-1,49.266

Lord Goring <font> strongly <$$font>: Oh, fight in any case - in any case.
WILDE-1895-1,49.267

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> with a gesture of despair <$$font>: If my wife
found out, there would be little left to fight for.  WILDE-1895-1,49.268

Well, as soon as I hear from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.
WILDE-1895-1,49.269

It is a chance, just a chance, WILDE-1895-1,49.270

but I believe in it.  WILDE-1895-1,49.271

And as I fought the age with its own weapons, I will fight her with
her weapons.  WILDE-1895-1,49.272

It is only fair, WILDE-1895-1,49.273

and she looks like a woman with a past, $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} she?
WILDE-1895-1,49.274

Lord Goring: Most pretty women do.  WILDE-1895-1,49.275

But there is a fashion in pasts just as there is a fashion in frocks.
WILDE-1895-1,49.276

Perhaps Mrs Cheveley's past is merely a slight <font> de`collete` <$$font>
one, WILDE-1895-1,49.277

and they are excessively popular nowadays.  WILDE-1895-1,49.278

Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening
Mrs Cheveley.  WILDE-1895-1,49.279

I should not fancy Mrs Cheveley is a woman who would be easily frightened.
WILDE-1895-1,49.280

She has survived all her creditors, WILDE-1895-1,49.281

and she shows wonderful presence of mind.  WILDE-1895-1,49.282

<P_50>

Sir Robert Chiltern: Oh!  I live on hopes now.  WILDE-1895-1,50.284

I clutch at every chance.  WILDE-1895-1,50.285

I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  WILDE-1895-1,50.286

The water is round my feet, WILDE-1895-1,50.287

and the very air is bitter with storm.  WILDE-1895-1,50.288

Hush!  I hear my wife's voice.  WILDE-1895-1,50.289

<font> Enter Lady Chiltern in walking dress.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,50.290

Lady Chiltern: Good afternoon, Lord Goring!  WILDE-1895-1,50.291

Lord Goring: Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  WILDE-1895-1,50.292

Have you been in the Park?  WILDE-1895-1,50.293

Lady Chiltern: No; I have just come from the Woman's Liberal Association
, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with loud applause ,
WILDE-1895-1,50.294

and now I have come in to have my tea.  WILDE-1895-1,50.295

<font> To Lord Goring.  <$$font> You will wait and have some tea, $wo
$n't {TEXT:won't} you?  WILDE-1895-1,50.296

Lord Goring: $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} wait for a short time, thanks.
WILDE-1895-1,50.297

Lady Chiltern: I will be back in a moment.  WILDE-1895-1,50.298

I am only going to take my hat off.  WILDE-1895-1,50.299

Lord Goring <font> in his most earnest manner <$$font>: Oh!  please $do
$n't {TEXT:don't}.  WILDE-1895-1,50.300

It is so pretty.  WILDE-1895-1,50.301

One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.  WILDE-1895-1,50.302

I hope the Woman's Liberal Association received it with loud applause.
WILDE-1895-1,50.303

Lady Chiltern <font> with a smile <$$font>: We have much more
important work to do than look at each other's bonnets, Lord Goring.
WILDE-1895-1,50.304

Lord Goring: Really?  WILDE-1895-1,50.305

What sort of work?  WILDE-1895-1,50.306

Lady Chiltern: Oh!  dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts,
Female Inspectors, the Eight Hours'Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise...
Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly uninteresting.
WILDE-1895-1,50.307

<P_51>

Lord Goring: And never bonnets?  WILDE-1895-1,51.309

Lady Chiltern <font> with mock indignation <$$font>: Never bonnets, never!
WILDE-1895-1,51.310

<font> Lady Chiltern goes through the door leading to her boudoir.
<$$font> WILDE-1895-1,51.311

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> takes Lord Goring's hand <$$font>:
WILDE-1895-1,51.312

You have been a good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.
WILDE-1895-1,51.313

Lord Goring: I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know that I have been able to do
much for you, Robert, as yet.  WILDE-1895-1,51.314

In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as far as I can see.
WILDE-1895-1,51.315

I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.  WILDE-1895-1,51.316

Sir Robert Chiltern: You have enabled me to tell you the truth.
WILDE-1895-1,51.317

That is something.  WILDE-1895-1,51.318

The truth has always stifled me.  WILDE-1895-1,51.319

Lord Goring: Ah!  the truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible!
WILDE-1895-1,51.320

Bad habit, by the way.  WILDE-1895-1,51.321

Makes one very unpopular at the club...  with the older members.
WILDE-1895-1,51.322

They call it being conceited.  WILDE-1895-1,51.323

Perhaps it is.  WILDE-1895-1,51.324

Sir Robert Chiltern: I would to God that I had been able to tell the
truth...  to live the truth.  WILDE-1895-1,51.325

Ah!  that is the great thing in life, to live the truth.
WILDE-1895-1,51.326

<font> Sighs, WILDE-1895-1,51.327

and goes towards the door.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,51.328

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} see you soon again, Arthur, $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't} I?
WILDE-1895-1,51.329

Lord Goring: Certainly.  Whenever you like.  WILDE-1895-1,51.330

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} going to look in at the Bachelors'Ball tonight, unless
I find something better to do.  WILDE-1895-1,51.331

But $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} come round tomorrow morning.  WILDE-1895-1,51.332

If you should want me tonight by any chance, send round a note to
Curzon Street.  WILDE-1895-1,51.333

Sir Robert Chiltern: Thank you.  WILDE-1895-1,51.334

<font> As he reaches the door, Lady Chiltern enters from her boudoir.
<$$font> WILDE-1895-1,51.335

<P_52>

Lady Chiltern: You are not going, Robert?  WILDE-1895-1,52.337

Sir Robert Chiltern: I have some letters to write, dear.
WILDE-1895-1,52.338

Lady Chiltern <font> going to him <$$font>: You work too hard, Robert.
WILDE-1895-1,52.339

You seem never to think of yourself, WILDE-1895-1,52.340

and you are looking so tired.  WILDE-1895-1,52.341

Sir Robert Chiltern: It is nothing, dear, nothing.  WILDE-1895-1,52.342

<font> He kisses her WILDE-1895-1,52.343

and goes out.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,52.344

Lady Chiltern <font> to Lord Goring <$$font>: Do sit down.
WILDE-1895-1,52.345

I am so glad you have called.  WILDE-1895-1,52.346

I want to talk to you about...  well, not about bonnets, or the Woman's
Liberal Association.  WILDE-1895-1,52.347

You take far too much interest in the first subject, and not nearly
enough in the second.  WILDE-1895-1,52.348

Lord Goring: You want to talk to me about Mrs Cheveley?
WILDE-1895-1,52.349

Lady Chiltern: Yes.  You have guessed it.  WILDE-1895-1,52.350

After you left last night I found out that what she had said was really
true.  WILDE-1895-1,52.351

Of course I made Robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his
promise.  WILDE-1895-1,52.352

Lord Goring: So he gave me to understand.  WILDE-1895-1,52.353

Lady Chiltern: To have kept it would have been the first stain on a
career that has been stainless always.  WILDE-1895-1,52.354

Robert must be above reproach.  WILDE-1895-1,52.355

He is not like other men.  WILDE-1895-1,52.356

He $can $not {TEXT:cannot} afford to do what other men do.
WILDE-1895-1,52.357

<font> She looks at Lord Goring, who remains silent.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,52.358

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you agree with me?  WILDE-1895-1,52.359

You are Robert's greatest friend.  WILDE-1895-1,52.360

You are our greatest friend, Lord Goring.  WILDE-1895-1,52.361

No one, except myself, knows Robert better than you do.
WILDE-1895-1,52.362

He has no secrets from me, WILDE-1895-1,52.363

and I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think he has any from you.
WILDE-1895-1,52.364

Lord Goring: He certainly has no secrets from me.  WILDE-1895-1,52.365

At least I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think so.  WILDE-1895-1,52.366

<P_53>

Lady Chiltern: Then am I not right in my estimate of him?
WILDE-1895-1,53.368

I know I am right.  WILDE-1895-1,53.369

But speak to me frankly.  WILDE-1895-1,53.370

Lord Goring <font> looking straight at her <$$font>: Quite frankly?
WILDE-1895-1,53.371

Lady Chiltern: Surely.  You have nothing to conceal have you?
WILDE-1895-1,53.372

Lord Goring: Nothing.  WILDE-1895-1,53.373

But, my dear Lady Chiltern, I think, if you will allow me to say so,
that in practical life - Lady Chiltern <font> smiling <$$font>: Of which
you know so little, Lord Goring - Lord Goring: Of which I know nothing
by experience, though I know something by observation.  I think that in
practical life there is something about success, actual success, that is a
little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is unscrupulous always.
WILDE-1895-1,53.374

Once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to a certain point,
if he has to climb the crag, he climbs the crag; WILDE-1895-1,53.375

if he has to walk in the mire - Lady Chiltern: Well?  Lord Goring:
He walks in the mire.  WILDE-1895-1,53.376

Of course I am only talking generally about life.  WILDE-1895-1,53.377

Lady Chiltern <font> gravely <$$font>: I hope so.  WILDE-1895-1,53.378

Why do you look at me so strangely, Lord Goring?  WILDE-1895-1,53.379

Lord Goring: Lady Chiltern, I have sometimes thought that...  perhaps you
are a little hard in some of your views on life.  WILDE-1895-1,53.380

I think that...  often you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} make sufficient
allowances.  WILDE-1895-1,53.381

In every nature there are elements of weakness, or worse than weakness.
WILDE-1895-1,53.382

Supposing, for instance, that - that any public man, my father, or Lord
Merton, or Robert, say, had, years ago, written some foolish letter to
someone... .  WILDE-1895-1,53.383

<P_54>

Lady Chiltern: What do you mean by a foolish letter?  WILDE-1895-1,54.385

Lord Goring: A letter gravely compromising one's position.
WILDE-1895-1,54.386

I am only putting an imaginary case.  WILDE-1895-1,54.387

Lady Chiltern: Robert is as incapable of doing a foolish thing as he is
of doing a wrong thing.  WILDE-1895-1,54.388

Lord Goring <font> after a long pause <$$font>: Nobody is incapable of
doing a foolish thing.  WILDE-1895-1,54.389

Nobody is incapable of doing a wrong thing.  WILDE-1895-1,54.390

Lady Chiltern: Are you a Pessimist?  WILDE-1895-1,54.391

What will the other dandies say?  WILDE-1895-1,54.392

They will all have to go into mourning.  WILDE-1895-1,54.393

Lord Goring <font> rising <$$font>: No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a
Pessimist.  WILDE-1895-1,54.394

Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.
WILDE-1895-1,54.395

All I do know is that life $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be understood without
much charity, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be lived without much charity.
WILDE-1895-1,54.396

It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation
of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.
WILDE-1895-1,54.397

And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely,
and I will help you in every way I can.  WILDE-1895-1,54.398

If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.
WILDE-1895-1,54.399

Come at once to me.  WILDE-1895-1,54.400

Lady Chiltern <font> looking at him in surprise <$$font>: Lord Goring,
you are talking quite seriously.  WILDE-1895-1,54.401

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think I ever heard you talk seriously before.
WILDE-1895-1,54.402

Lord Goring <font> laughing <$$font>: You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern.
WILDE-1895-1,54.403

It $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} occur again, if I can help it.
WILDE-1895-1,54.404

Lady Chiltern: But I like you to be serious.  WILDE-1895-1,54.405

<font> Enter Mabel Chiltern, in the most ravishing frock.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,54.406

<P_55>

Mabel Chiltern: Dear Gertrude, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} say such a dreadful
thing to Lord Goring.  WILDE-1895-1,55.408

Seriousness would be very unbecoming to him.  WILDE-1895-1,55.409

Good afternoon, Lord Goring!  WILDE-1895-1,55.410

Pray be as trivial as you can.  WILDE-1895-1,55.411

Lord Goring: I should like to, Miss Mabel, WILDE-1895-1,55.412

but I am afraid I am...  a little out of practice this morning;
WILDE-1895-1,55.413

and besides, I have to be going now.  WILDE-1895-1,55.414

Mabel Chiltern: Just when I have come in!  WILDE-1895-1,55.415

What dreadful manners you have!  WILDE-1895-1,55.416

I am sure you were very badly brought up.  WILDE-1895-1,55.417

Lord Goring: I was.  WILDE-1895-1,55.418

Mabel Chiltern: I wish I had brought you up!  WILDE-1895-1,55.419

Lord Goring: I am so sorry you $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}.
WILDE-1895-1,55.420

Mabel Chiltern: It is too late now, I suppose?  WILDE-1895-1,55.421

Lord Goring <font> smiling <$$font>: I am not so sure.
WILDE-1895-1,55.422

Mabel Chiltern: Will you ride tomorrow morning?  WILDE-1895-1,55.423

Lord Goring: Yes, at ten.  WILDE-1895-1,55.424

Mabel Chiltern: $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} forget.  WILDE-1895-1,55.425

Lord Goring: Of course I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't}.  WILDE-1895-1,55.426

By the way, Lady Chiltern, there is no list of your guests in <font>
The Morning Post <$$font> of today.  WILDE-1895-1,55.427

It has apparently been crowded out by the County Council, or the Lambeth
Conference, or something equally boring.  WILDE-1895-1,55.428

Could you let me have a list?  WILDE-1895-1,55.429

I have a particular reason for asking you.  WILDE-1895-1,55.430

Lady Chiltern: I am sure Mr Trafford will be able to give you one.
WILDE-1895-1,55.431

<P_56>

Lord Goring: Thanks, so much.  WILDE-1895-1,56.433

Mabel Chiltern: Tommy is the most useful person in London.
WILDE-1895-1,56.434

Lord Goring <font> turning to her <$$font>: And who is the most
ornamental?  WILDE-1895-1,56.435

Mabel Chiltern <font> triumphantly <$$font>: I am.  WILDE-1895-1,56.436

Lord Goring: How clever of you to guess it!  WILDE-1895-1,56.437

<font> Takes up his hat and cane.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,56.438

Good-bye, Lady Chiltern!  WILDE-1895-1,56.439

You will remember what I said to you, $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} you?
WILDE-1895-1,56.440

Lady Chiltern: Yes; but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know why you said it
to me.  WILDE-1895-1,56.441

Lord Goring: I hardly know myself.  WILDE-1895-1,56.442

Good-bye, Miss Mabel!  WILDE-1895-1,56.443

Mabel Chiltern <font> with a little moue of disappointment <$$font>:
I wish you were not going.  WILDE-1895-1,56.444

I have had four wonderful adventures this morning; four and a half,
in fact.  WILDE-1895-1,56.445

You might stop and listen to some of them.  WILDE-1895-1,56.446

Lord Goring: How very selfish of you to have four and a half!
WILDE-1895-1,56.447

There $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} be any left for me.  WILDE-1895-1,56.448

Mabel Chiltern: I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want you to have any.
WILDE-1895-1,56.449

They would not be good for you.  WILDE-1895-1,56.450

Lord Goring: That is the first unkind thing you have ever said to me.
WILDE-1895-1,56.451

How charmingly you said it!  WILDE-1895-1,56.452

Ten tomorrow.  WILDE-1895-1,56.453

Mabel Chiltern: Sharp.  WILDE-1895-1,56.454

Lord Goring: Quite sharp.  WILDE-1895-1,56.455

But $do $n't {TEXT:don't} bring Mr Trafford.  WILDE-1895-1,56.456

Mabel Chiltern <font> with a little toss of the head <$$font>: Of course
I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't} bring Tommy Trafford.  WILDE-1895-1,56.457

Tommy Trafford is in great disgrace.  WILDE-1895-1,56.458

<P_57>

Lord Goring: I am delighted to hear it.  WILDE-1895-1,57.460

<font> Bows WILDE-1895-1,57.461

and goes out.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,57.462

Mabel Chiltern: Gertrude, I wish you would speak to Tommy Trafford.
WILDE-1895-1,57.463

Lady Chiltern: What has poor Mr Trafford done this time?
WILDE-1895-1,57.464

Robert says he is the best secretary he has ever had.  WILDE-1895-1,57.465

Mabel Chiltern: Well, Tommy has proposed to me again.  WILDE-1895-1,57.466

Tommy really does nothing but propose to me.  WILDE-1895-1,57.467

He proposed to me last night in the music-room, when I was quite
unprotected, as there was an elaborate trio going on.  WILDE-1895-1,57.468

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} dare to make the smallest repartee,
WILDE-1895-1,57.469

I need hardly tell you.  WILDE-1895-1,57.470

If I had, it would have stopped the music at once.  WILDE-1895-1,57.471

Musical people are so absurdly unreasonable.  WILDE-1895-1,57.472

They always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one
is longing to be absolutely deaf.  WILDE-1895-1,57.473

Then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning, in front of that
dreadful statue of Achilles.  WILDE-1895-1,57.474

Really, the things that go on in front of that work of art are quite
appalling.  WILDE-1895-1,57.475

The police should interfere.  WILDE-1895-1,57.476

At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose
again, WILDE-1895-1,57.477

and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was
a bimetallist.  WILDE-1895-1,57.478

Fortunately I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what bimetallism means.
WILDE-1895-1,57.479

And I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} believe anybody else does either.
WILDE-1895-1,57.480

But the observation crushed Tommy for ten minutes.  WILDE-1895-1,57.481

He looked quite shocked.  WILDE-1895-1,57.482

And then Tommy is so annoying in the way he proposes.  WILDE-1895-1,57.483

If he proposed at the top of his voice, I should not mind so much.
WILDE-1895-1,57.484

That might produce some effect on the public.  WILDE-1895-1,57.485

But he does it in a horrid confidential way.  WILDE-1895-1,57.486

When Tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor.
WILDE-1895-1,57.487

I am very fond of Tommy, WILDE-1895-1,57.488

but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.  WILDE-1895-1,57.489

I wish, Gertrude, you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week
is quite often enough to propose to any one, and that it should always
be done in a manner that attracts some attention.  WILDE-1895-1,57.490

<P_58>

Lady Chiltern: Dear Mabel, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} talk like that.
WILDE-1895-1,58.492

Besides, Robert thinks very highly of Mr Trafford.  WILDE-1895-1,58.493

He believes he has a brilliant future before him.  WILDE-1895-1,58.494

Mabel Chiltern: Oh!  I $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} marry a man with a
future before him for anything under the sun.  WILDE-1895-1,58.495

Lady Chiltern: Mabel!  WILDE-1895-1,58.496

Mabel Chiltern: I know, dear.  WILDE-1895-1,58.497

You married a man with a future, $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} you?
WILDE-1895-1,58.498

But then Robert was a genius, WILDE-1895-1,58.499

and you have a noble, self-sacrificing character.  WILDE-1895-1,58.500

You can stand geniuses.  WILDE-1895-1,58.501

I have no character at all, WILDE-1895-1,58.502

and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear.  WILDE-1895-1,58.503

As a rule, I think they are quite impossible.  WILDE-1895-1,58.504

Geniuses talk so much, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} they?  WILDE-1895-1,58.505

Such a bad habit!  WILDE-1895-1,58.506

And they are always thinking about themselves, when I want them to be
thinking about me.  WILDE-1895-1,58.507

I must go round now and rehearse at Lady Basildon's.  WILDE-1895-1,58.508

You remember, we are having tableaux, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you?
The Triumph of something, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what!
WILDE-1895-1,58.509

I hope it will be triumph of me.  Only triumph I am really interested
in at present.  WILDE-1895-1,58.510

<font> Kisses Lady Chiltern WILDE-1895-1,58.511

and goes out; WILDE-1895-1,58.512

then comes running back.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,58.513

Oh, Gertrude, do you know who is coming to see you?  WILDE-1895-1,58.514

That dreadful Mrs Cheveley, in a most lovely gown.  WILDE-1895-1,58.515

Did you ask her?  WILDE-1895-1,58.516

Lady Chiltern <font> rising <$$font>: Mrs Cheveley!  Coming to see me?
WILDE-1895-1,58.517

Impossible!  WILDE-1895-1,58.518

Mabel Chiltern: I assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life
and not nearly so natural.  WILDE-1895-1,58.519

Lady Chiltern: You need not wait, Mabel.  WILDE-1895-1,58.520

Remember, Lady Basildon is expecting you.  WILDE-1895-1,58.521

Mabel Chiltern: Oh!  I must shake hands with Lady Markby.
WILDE-1895-1,58.522

She is delightful.  WILDE-1895-1,58.523

I love being scolded by her.  WILDE-1895-1,58.524

<font> Enter Mason.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,58.525

<P_59>

Mason: Lady Markby and Mrs Cheveley.  WILDE-1895-1,59.527

<font> Enter Lady Markby and Mrs Cheveley.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,59.528

Lady Chiltern <font> advancing to meet them <$$font>: Dear Lady Markby,
how nice of you to come and see me!  WILDE-1895-1,59.529

<font> Shakes hands with her, WILDE-1895-1,59.530

and bows somewhat distantly to Mrs Cheveley.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,59.531

$Wo $n't {TEXT:Won't} you sit down, Mrs Cheveley?  WILDE-1895-1,59.532

Mrs Cheveley: Thanks.  WILDE-1895-1,59.533

$Is $n't {TEXT:Isn't} that Miss Chiltern?  WILDE-1895-1,59.534

I should like so much to know her.  WILDE-1895-1,59.535

Lady Chiltern: Mabel, Mrs Cheveley wishes to know you.
WILDE-1895-1,59.536

<font> Mabel Chiltern gives a little nod.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,59.537

Mrs Cheveley <font> sitting down <$$font>: I thought your frock so
charming last night, Miss Chiltern.  WILDE-1895-1,59.538

So simple and...  suitable.  WILDE-1895-1,59.539

Mabel Chiltern: Really?  WILDE-1895-1,59.540

I must tell my dressmaker.  WILDE-1895-1,59.541

It will be such a surprise to her.  WILDE-1895-1,59.542

Good-bye, Lady Markby!  WILDE-1895-1,59.543

Lady Markby: Going already?  WILDE-1895-1,59.544

Mabel Chiltern: I am so sorry WILDE-1895-1,59.545

but I am obliged to.  I am just off to rehearsal.  WILDE-1895-1,59.546

I have got to stand on my head in some tableaux.  WILDE-1895-1,59.547

Lady Markby: On your head, child?  WILDE-1895-1,59.548

Oh!  I hope not.  WILDE-1895-1,59.549

I believe it is most unhealthy.  WILDE-1895-1,59.550

<font> Takes a seat on the sofa next Lady Chiltern.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,59.551

Mabel Chiltern: But it is for an excellent charity: in aid of
the Undeserving, the only people I am really interested in.
WILDE-1895-1,59.552

I am the secretary, WILDE-1895-1,59.553

and Tommy Trafford is treasurer.  WILDE-1895-1,59.554

Mrs Cheveley: And what is Lord Goring?  WILDE-1895-1,59.555

<P_60>

Mabel Chiltern: Oh!  Lord Goring is president.  WILDE-1895-1,60.557

Mrs Cheveley: The post should suit him admirably, unless he has
deteriorated since I knew him first.  WILDE-1895-1,60.558

Lady Markby <font> reflecting <$$font>: You are remarkably modern, Mabel.
WILDE-1895-1,60.559

A little too modern, perhaps.  WILDE-1895-1,60.560

Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern.  WILDE-1895-1,60.561

One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  WILDE-1895-1,60.562

I have known many instances of it.  WILDE-1895-1,60.563

Mabel Chiltern: What a dreadful prospect!  WILDE-1895-1,60.564

Lady Markby: Ah!  my dear, you need not be nervous.  WILDE-1895-1,60.565

You will always be as pretty as possible.  WILDE-1895-1,60.566

That is the best fashion there is, and the only fashion that England
succeeds in setting.  WILDE-1895-1,60.567

Mabel Chiltern <font> with a curtsey <$$font>: Thank you so much, Lady
Markby, for England...  and myself.  WILDE-1895-1,60.568

<font> Goes out.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,60.569

Lady Markby <font> turning to Lady Chiltern <$$font>: Dear Gertrude,
we just called to know if Mrs Cheveley's diamond brooch has been found.
WILDE-1895-1,60.570

Lady Chiltern: Here?  WILDE-1895-1,60.571

Mrs Cheveley: Yes.  I missed it when I got back to Claridge's,
WILDE-1895-1,60.572

and I thought I might possibly have dropped it here.  WILDE-1895-1,60.573

Lady Chiltern: I have heard nothing about it.  WILDE-1895-1,60.574

But I will send for the butler and ask.  WILDE-1895-1,60.575

<font> Touches the bell.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,60.576

Mrs Cheveley: Oh, pray $do $n't {TEXT:don't} trouble, Lady Chiltern.
WILDE-1895-1,60.577

I dare say I lost it at the Opera, before we came on here.
WILDE-1895-1,60.578

<P_61>

Lady Markby: Ah yes, I suppose it must have been at the Opera.
WILDE-1895-1,61.580

The fact is, we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that I
wonder we have anything at all left on us at the end of an evening.
WILDE-1895-1,61.581

I know myself that, when I am coming back from the Drawing Room,
I always feel as if I $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't} a shred on me, except
a small shred of decent reputation, just enough to prevent the lower
classes making painful observations through the windows of the carriage.
WILDE-1895-1,61.582

The fact is that our Society is terribly over-populated.
WILDE-1895-1,61.583

Really, someone should arrange a proper scheme of assisted emigration.
WILDE-1895-1,61.584

It would do a great deal of good.  WILDE-1895-1,61.585

Mrs Cheveley: I quite agree with you, Lady Markby.  WILDE-1895-1,61.586

It is nearly six years since I have been in London for the Season,
WILDE-1895-1,61.587

and I must say Society has become dreadfully mixed.  WILDE-1895-1,61.588

One sees the oddest people everywhere.  WILDE-1895-1,61.589

Lady Markby: That is quite true, dear.  WILDE-1895-1,61.590

But one $need $n't {TEXT:needn't} know them.  WILDE-1895-1,61.591

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sure I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know half the people who
come to my house.  WILDE-1895-1,61.592

Indeed, from all I hear, I $should $n't {TEXT:shouldn't} like to.
WILDE-1895-1,61.593

<font> Enter Mason.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,61.594

Lady Chiltern: What sort of a brooch was it that you lost, Mrs Cheveley?
WILDE-1895-1,61.595

Mrs Cheveley: A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large ruby.
WILDE-1895-1,61.596

Lady Markby: I thought you said there was a sapphire on the head, dear?
WILDE-1895-1,61.597

Mrs Cheveley <font> smiling.  <$$font> No, Lady Markby - a ruby.
WILDE-1895-1,61.598

Lady Markby <font> nodding her head <$$font>: And very becoming, I am
quite sure.  WILDE-1895-1,61.599

Lady Chiltern: Has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the
rooms this morning, Mason?  WILDE-1895-1,61.600

<P_62>

Mason: No, my lady.  WILDE-1895-1,62.602

Mrs Cheveley: It really is of no consequence, Lady Chiltern.
WILDE-1895-1,62.603

I am so sorry to have put you to any inconvenience.  WILDE-1895-1,62.604

Lady Chiltern <font> coldly <$$font>: Oh, it has been no inconvenience.
WILDE-1895-1,62.605

That will do, Mason.  WILDE-1895-1,62.606

You can bring tea.  WILDE-1895-1,62.607

<font> Exit Mason.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,62.608

Lady Markby: Well, I must say it is most annoying to lose anything.
WILDE-1895-1,62.609

I remember once at Bath, years ago, losing in the Pump Room an exceedingly
handsome cameo bracelet that Sir John had given me.  WILDE-1895-1,62.610

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think he has ever given me anything since,
I am sorry to say.  WILDE-1895-1,62.611

He has sadly degenerated.  WILDE-1895-1,62.612

Really, this horrid House of Commons quite ruins our husbands for us.
WILDE-1895-1,62.613

I think the Lower House by far the greatest blow to a happy married
life that there has been since that terrible thing called the Higher
Education of Women was invented.  WILDE-1895-1,62.614

Lady Chiltern: Ah!  it is heresy to say that in this house, Lady Markby.
WILDE-1895-1,62.615

Robert is a great champion of the Higher Education of Women,
WILDE-1895-1,62.616

and so, I am afraid, am I.  WILDE-1895-1,62.617

Mrs Cheveley: The higher education of men is what I should like to see.
WILDE-1895-1,62.618

Men need it so sadly.  WILDE-1895-1,62.619

Lady Markby: They do, dear.  WILDE-1895-1,62.620

But I am afraid such a scheme would be quite unpractical.
WILDE-1895-1,62.621

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think man has much capacity for development.
WILDE-1895-1,62.622

He has got as far as he can, WILDE-1895-1,62.623

and that is not far, is it?  WILDE-1895-1,62.624

With regard to women, well, dear Gertrude, you belong to the younger
generation, WILDE-1895-1,62.625

and I am sure it is all right if you approve of it.  WILDE-1895-1,62.626

In my time, of course, we were taught not to understand anything.
WILDE-1895-1,62.627

That was the old system, WILDE-1895-1,62.628

and wonderfully interesting it was.  WILDE-1895-1,62.629

I assure you that the amount of things I and my poor dear sister were
taught not to understand was quite extraordinary.  WILDE-1895-1,62.630

But modern women understand everything, I am told.  WILDE-1895-1,62.631

<P_63>

Mrs Cheveley: Except their husbands.  WILDE-1895-1,63.633

That is the one thing the modern woman never understands.
WILDE-1895-1,63.634

Lady Markby: And a very good thing too, dear, I dare say.
WILDE-1895-1,63.635

It might break up many a happy home if they did.  WILDE-1895-1,63.636

Not yours, I need hardly say, Gertrude.  WILDE-1895-1,63.637

You have married a pattern husband.  WILDE-1895-1,63.638

I wish I could say as much for myself.  WILDE-1895-1,63.639

But since Sir John has taken to attending the debates regularly, which
he never used to do in the good old days, his language has become quite
impossible.  WILDE-1895-1,63.640

He always seems to think that he is addressing the House,
WILDE-1895-1,63.641

and consequently whenever he discusses the state of the agricultural
labourer, or the Welsh Church, or something quite improper of that kind, I
am obliged to send all the servants out of the room.  WILDE-1895-1,63.642

It is not pleasant to see one's own butler, who has been with one
for twenty-three years, actually blushing at the side-board, and
the footmen making contortions in corners like persons in circuses.
WILDE-1895-1,63.643

I assure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send John at once
to the Upper House.  WILDE-1895-1,63.644

He $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} take any interest in politics then, will he?
WILDE-1895-1,63.645

The House of Lords is so sensible.  An assembly of gentlemen.
WILDE-1895-1,63.646

But in his present state, Sir John is really a great trial.
WILDE-1895-1,63.647

Why, this morning before breakfast was half-over, he stood up on the
hearthrug, WILDE-1895-1,63.648

put his hands in his pockets, WILDE-1895-1,63.649

and appealed to the country at the top of his voice.  WILDE-1895-1,63.650

I left the table as soon as I had my second cup of tea, I need hardly say.
WILDE-1895-1,63.651

But his violent language could be heard all over the house!
WILDE-1895-1,63.652

I trust, Gertrude, that Sir Robert is not like that?  WILDE-1895-1,63.653

Lady Chiltern: But I am very much interested in politics, Lady Markby.
WILDE-1895-1,63.654

I love to hear Robert talk about them.  WILDE-1895-1,63.655

Lady Markby: Well, I hope he is not as devoted to Blue Books as Sir
John is.  WILDE-1895-1,63.656

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think they can be quite improving reading
for anyone.  WILDE-1895-1,63.657

Mrs Cheveley <font> languidly <$$font>: I have never read a Blue Book.
WILDE-1895-1,63.658

I prefer books...  in yellow covers.  WILDE-1895-1,63.659

<P_64>

Lady Markby <font> genially unconscious <$$font>: Yellow is a gayer
colour, is it not?  WILDE-1895-1,64.661

I used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, WILDE-1895-1,64.662

and would do so now if Sir John was not so painfully personal in his
observations, WILDE-1895-1,64.663

and a man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not?
WILDE-1895-1,64.664

Mrs Cheveley: Oh, no!  WILDE-1895-1,64.665

I think men are the only authorities on dress.  WILDE-1895-1,64.666

Lady Markby: Really?  WILDE-1895-1,64.667

One $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} say so from the sort of hats they wear,
would one?  WILDE-1895-1,64.668

<font> The butler enters, followed by the footman.  WILDE-1895-1,64.669

Tea is set on a small table close to Lady Chiltern.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,64.670

Lady Chiltern: May I give you some tea, Mrs Cheveley?  WILDE-1895-1,64.671

Mrs Cheveley: Thanks.  WILDE-1895-1,64.672

<font> The butler hands Mrs Cheveley a cup of tea on a salver.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,64.673

Lady Chiltern: Some tea, Lady Markby?  WILDE-1895-1,64.674

Lady Markby: No thanks, dear.  WILDE-1895-1,64.675

<font> The servants go out.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,64.676

The fact is, I have promised to go round for ten minutes to see poor
Lady Brancaster, who is in very great trouble.  WILDE-1895-1,64.677

Her daughter, quite a well-brought-up girl, too, has actually become
engaged to be married to a curate in Shropshire.  WILDE-1895-1,64.678

It is very sad, very sad indeed.  WILDE-1895-1,64.679

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} understand this modern mania for curates.
WILDE-1895-1,64.680

In my time we girls saw them, of course, running about the place like
rabbits.  WILDE-1895-1,64.681

But we never took any notice of them, I need hardly say.
WILDE-1895-1,64.682

But I am told that nowadays country society is quite honeycombed with
them.  WILDE-1895-1,64.683

I think it most irreligious.  WILDE-1895-1,64.684

And then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father,
WILDE-1895-1,64.685

and it is said that when they meet at the club Lord Brancaster always
hides himself behind the money article in <font> The Times.  <$$font>
WILDE-1895-1,64.686

However, I believe that is quite a common occurrence nowadays and that
they have to take in extra copies of <font> The Times <$$font> at all the
clubs in St James's <P_65> Street; there are so many sons who $wo $n't
{TEXT:won't} have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers
who $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} speak to their sons.  WILDE-1895-1,65.687

I think myself, it is very much to be regretted.  WILDE-1895-1,65.688

Mrs Cheveley: So do I.  WILDE-1895-1,65.689

Fathers have so much to learn from their sons nowadays.
WILDE-1895-1,65.690

Lady Markby: Really, dear?  WILDE-1895-1,65.691

What?  WILDE-1895-1,65.692

Mrs Cheveley: The art of living.  WILDE-1895-1,65.693

The only really Fine Art we have produced in modern times.
WILDE-1895-1,65.694

Lady Markby <font> shaking her head <$$font>: Ah!  I am afraid Lord
Brancaster knew a good deal about that.  More than his poor wife ever did.
WILDE-1895-1,65.695

<font> Turning to Lady Chiltern.  <$$font> You know Lady Brancaster,
$do $n't {TEXT:don't} you, dear?  WILDE-1895-1,65.696

Lady Chiltern: Just slightly.  WILDE-1895-1,65.697

She was staying at Langton last autumn, when we were there.
WILDE-1895-1,65.698

Lady Markby: Well, like all stout women, she looks the very picture of
happiness, as no doubt you noticed.  WILDE-1895-1,65.699

But there are many tragedies in her family, besides this affair of
the curate.  WILDE-1895-1,65.700

Her own sister, Mrs Jekyll, had a most unhappy life; through no fault
of her own, I am sorry to say.  WILDE-1895-1,65.701

She ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into a convent,
or on to the operatic stage, I forget which.  WILDE-1895-1,65.702

No; I think it was decorative art-needlework she took up.
WILDE-1895-1,65.703

I know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life.  WILDE-1895-1,65.704

<font> Rising.  <$$font> And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall
leave Mrs Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of
an hour.  WILDE-1895-1,65.705

Or perhaps, dear Mrs Cheveley, you $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't}
mind waiting in the carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.
WILDE-1895-1,65.706

As I intend it to be a visit of condolence, I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't}
stay long.  WILDE-1895-1,65.707

Mrs Cheveley <font> rising <$$font>: I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind waiting
in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one.
WILDE-1895-1,65.708

<P_66>

Lady Markby: Well, I hear the curate is always prowling about the house.
WILDE-1895-1,66.710

Mrs Cheveley: I am afraid I am not fond of girl friends.
WILDE-1895-1,66.711

Lady Chiltern <font> rising <$$font>: Oh, I hope Mrs Cheveley will stay
here a little.  WILDE-1895-1,66.712

I should like to have a few minute's {COM:sic} conversation with her.
WILDE-1895-1,66.713

Mrs Cheveley: How very kind of you, Lady Chiltern!  WILDE-1895-1,66.714

Believe me, nothing would give me greater pleasure.  WILDE-1895-1,66.715

Lady Markby: Ah!  no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of
your schooldays to talk over together.  WILDE-1895-1,66.716

Good-bye, dear Gertrude!  WILDE-1895-1,66.717

Shall I see you at Lady Bonar's tonight?  WILDE-1895-1,66.718

She has discovered a wonderful new genius.  WILDE-1895-1,66.719

He does...  nothing at all, I believe.  WILDE-1895-1,66.720

That is a great comfort, is it not?  WILDE-1895-1,66.721

Lady Chiltern: Robert and I are dining at home by ourselves tonight,
WILDE-1895-1,66.722

and I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think I shall go anywhere afterwards.
WILDE-1895-1,66.723

Robert, of course, will have to be in the House.  WILDE-1895-1,66.724

But there is nothing interesting on.  WILDE-1895-1,66.725

Lady Markby: Dining at home by yourselves?  WILDE-1895-1,66.726

Is that quite prudent?  WILDE-1895-1,66.727

Ah, I forgot, your husband is an exception.  WILDE-1895-1,66.728

Mine is the general rule, WILDE-1895-1,66.729

and nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general
WILDE-1895-1,66.730

<font> Exit Lady Markby.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,66.731

Mrs Cheveley: Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} she?
WILDE-1895-1,66.732

Talks more and says less than anybody I ever met.  WILDE-1895-1,66.733

She is made to be a public speaker.  Much more so than her husband,
though he is a typical Englishman, always dull and usually violent.
WILDE-1895-1,66.734

Lady Chiltern <font> makes no answer, WILDE-1895-1,66.735

but remains standing.  WILDE-1895-1,66.736

There is a pause.  WILDE-1895-1,66.737

Then the eyes of the two women meet.  WILDE-1895-1,66.738

Lady Chiltern looks stern and pale.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,66.739

<P_67>

<font> Mrs Cheveley seems rather amused <$$font>: WILDE-1895-1,67.741

Mrs Cheveley {COM:sic}, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly
that, had I known who you really were, I should not have invited you to
my house last night.  WILDE-1895-1,67.742

Mrs Cheveley <font> with an impertinent smile <$$font>: Really?
WILDE-1895-1,67.743

Lady Chiltern: I could not have done so.  WILDE-1895-1,67.744

Mrs Cheveley: I see that after all these years you have not changed a
bit, Gertrude.  WILDE-1895-1,67.745

Lady Chiltern: I never change.  WILDE-1895-1,67.746

Mrs Cheveley <font> elevating her eyebrows <$$font>: Then life has taught
you nothing?  WILDE-1895-1,67.747

Lady Chiltern: It has taught me that a person who has once been guilty of
a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second time,
and should be shunned.  WILDE-1895-1,67.748

Mrs Cheveley: Would you apply that rule to everyone?  WILDE-1895-1,67.749

Lady Chiltern: Yes, to everyone, without exception.  WILDE-1895-1,67.750

Mrs Cheveley: Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for you.
WILDE-1895-1,67.751

Lady Chiltern: You see now, I am sure, that for many reasons any further
acquaintance between us during your stay in London is quite impossible?
WILDE-1895-1,67.752

Mrs Cheveley <font> leaning back in her chair <$$font>: Do you know,
Gertrude, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind your talking morality a bit.
WILDE-1895-1,67.753

Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally
dislike.  WILDE-1895-1,67.754

You dislike me.  WILDE-1895-1,67.755

I am quite aware of that.  WILDE-1895-1,67.756

And I have always detested you.  WILDE-1895-1,67.757

And yet I have come here to do you a service.  WILDE-1895-1,67.758

<P_68>

Lady Chiltern <font> contemptuously <$$font>: Like the service you wished
to render my husband last night, I suppose.  WILDE-1895-1,68.760

Thank heaven, I saved him from that.  WILDE-1895-1,68.761

Mrs Cheveley <font> starting to her feet <$$font>: It was you who made
him write that insolent letter to me?  WILDE-1895-1,68.762

It was you who made him break his promise?  WILDE-1895-1,68.763

Lady Chiltern: Yes.  WILDE-1895-1,68.764

Mrs Cheveley: Then you must make him keep it.  WILDE-1895-1,68.765

I give you till tomorrow morning - no more.  WILDE-1895-1,68.766

If by that time your husband does not solemnly bind himself to help
me in this great scheme in which I am interested - Lady Chiltern:
This fraudulent speculation - Mrs Cheveley: Call it what you choose.
I hold your husband in the hollow of my hand, WILDE-1895-1,68.767

and if you are wise you will make him do what I tell him.
WILDE-1895-1,68.768

Lady Chiltern <font> rising and going towards her <$$font>: You are
impertinent.  WILDE-1895-1,68.769

What has my husband to do with you?  With a woman like you?
WILDE-1895-1,68.770

Mrs Cheveley <font> with a bitter laugh <$$font>: In this world like
meets like.  WILDE-1895-1,68.771

It is because your husband is himself fraudulent and dishonest that we
pair so well together.  WILDE-1895-1,68.772

Between you and him there are chasms.  WILDE-1895-1,68.773

He and I are closer than friends.  WILDE-1895-1,68.774

We are enemies linked together.  WILDE-1895-1,68.775

The same sin binds us.  WILDE-1895-1,68.776

Lady Chiltern: How dare you class my husband with yourself?
WILDE-1895-1,68.777

How dare you threaten him or me?  WILDE-1895-1,68.778

Leave my house.  WILDE-1895-1,68.779

You are unfit to enter it.  WILDE-1895-1,68.780

<font> Sir Robert Chiltern enters from behind.  WILDE-1895-1,68.781

He hears his wife's last words, WILDE-1895-1,68.782

and sees to whom they are addressed.  WILDE-1895-1,68.783

He grows deadly pale.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,68.784

<P_69>

Mrs Cheveley: Your house!  A house bought with the price of
dishonour.  A house, everything in which has been paid for by fraud.
WILDE-1895-1,69.786

<font> Turns round WILDE-1895-1,69.787

and sees Sir Robert Chiltern.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,69.788

Ask him what the origin of his fortune is!  WILDE-1895-1,69.789

Get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret.
WILDE-1895-1,69.790

Learn from him to what you owe your position.  WILDE-1895-1,69.791

Lady Chiltern: It is not true!  WILDE-1895-1,69.792

Robert!  It is not true!  WILDE-1895-1,69.793

Mrs Cheveley <font> pointing at him with outstretched finger <$$font>
: Look at him!  WILDE-1895-1,69.794

Can he deny it?  WILDE-1895-1,69.795

Does he dare to?  WILDE-1895-1,69.796

Sir Robert Chiltern: Go!  WILDE-1895-1,69.797

Go at once.  WILDE-1895-1,69.798

You have done your worst now.  WILDE-1895-1,69.799

Mrs Cheveley: My worst?  WILDE-1895-1,69.800

I have not yet finished with you, with either of you.  WILDE-1895-1,69.801

I give you both till tomorrow at noon.  WILDE-1895-1,69.802

If by then you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} do what I bid you to do, the whole
world shall know the origin of Robert Chiltern.  WILDE-1895-1,69.803

<font> Sir Robert Chiltern strikes the bell.  WILDE-1895-1,69.804

Enter Mason.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,69.805

Sir Robert Chiltern: Show Mrs Cheveley out.  WILDE-1895-1,69.806

<font> Mrs Cheveley starts; WILDE-1895-1,69.807

then bows with somewhat exaggerated politeness to Lady Chiltern, who
makes no sign of response.  WILDE-1895-1,69.808

As she passes by Sir Robert Chiltern, who is standing close to the door,
she pauses for a moment WILDE-1895-1,69.809

and looks him straight in the face.  WILDE-1895-1,69.810

She then goes out, followed by the servant, who closes the door after him.
WILDE-1895-1,69.811

The husband and wife are left alone.  WILDE-1895-1,69.812

Lady Chiltern stands like someone in a dreadful dream.
WILDE-1895-1,69.813

Then she turns round WILDE-1895-1,69.814

and looks at her husband.  WILDE-1895-1,69.815

She looks at him with strange eyes, as though she was seeing him for
the first time.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,69.816

Lady Chiltern: You sold a Cabinet secret for money!  WILDE-1895-1,69.817

You began your life with fraud!  WILDE-1895-1,69.818

You built up your career on dishonour!  WILDE-1895-1,69.819

Oh, tell me it is not true!  WILDE-1895-1,69.820

Lie to me!  WILDE-1895-1,69.821

Lie to me!  WILDE-1895-1,69.822

Tell me it is not true!  WILDE-1895-1,69.823

<P_70>

Sir Robert Chiltern: What this woman said is quite true.
WILDE-1895-1,70.825

But, Gertrude, listen to me.  WILDE-1895-1,70.826

You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} realize how I was tempted.  WILDE-1895-1,70.827

Let me tell you the whole thing.  WILDE-1895-1,70.828

<font> Goes towards her.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,70.829

Lady Chiltern: $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} come near me.  WILDE-1895-1,70.830

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} touch me.  WILDE-1895-1,70.831

I feel as if you had soiled me for ever.  WILDE-1895-1,70.832

Oh!  what a mask you have been wearing all these years!
WILDE-1895-1,70.833

A horrible painted mask!  WILDE-1895-1,70.834

You sold yourself for money.  WILDE-1895-1,70.835

Oh!  a common thief were better.  WILDE-1895-1,70.836

You put yourself up to sale to the highest bidder!  WILDE-1895-1,70.837

You were bought in the market.  WILDE-1895-1,70.838

You lie to the whole world.  WILDE-1895-1,70.839

And yet you will not lie to me.  WILDE-1895-1,70.840

Sir Robert Chiltern <font> rushing towards her <$$font>: Gertrude!
Gertrude!  WILDE-1895-1,70.841

Lady Chiltern <font> thrusting him back with outstretched hands <$$font>
: No, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} speak!  WILDE-1895-1,70.842

Say nothing!  WILDE-1895-1,70.843

Your voice wakes terrible memories - memories of things that made me
love you - memories of words that made me love you - memories that now
are horrible to me.  WILDE-1895-1,70.844

And how I worshipped you!  WILDE-1895-1,70.845

You were to me something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble,
honest, without stain.  WILDE-1895-1,70.846

The world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and goodness more
real because you lived.  WILDE-1895-1,70.847

And now - oh, when I think that I made of a man like you my ideal!
the ideal of my life!  WILDE-1895-1,70.848

Sir Robert Chiltern: There was your mistake.  WILDE-1895-1,70.849

There was your error.  The error all women commit.  WILDE-1895-1,70.850

Why $can $n't {TEXT:can't} you women love us, faults and all?
WILDE-1895-1,70.851

Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  WILDE-1895-1,70.852

We have all feet of clay, women as well as men: WILDE-1895-1,70.853

but when we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses,
their follies, their imperfections, WILDE-1895-1,70.854

love them all the more, it may be, for that reason.  WILDE-1895-1,70.855

It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love.
WILDE-1895-1,70.856

It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others,
that love should come to cure us - WILDE-1895-1,70.857

else what use is love at all?  WILDE-1895-1,70.858

All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.
WILDE-1895-1,70.859

All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon.
WILDE-1895-1,70.860

A man's love is like that.  WILDE-1895-1,70.861

It is wider, <P_71> larger, more human than a woman's.
WILDE-1895-1,71.862

Women think that they are making ideals of men.  WILDE-1895-1,71.863

What they are making of us are false idols merely.  WILDE-1895-1,71.864

You made your false idol of me, WILDE-1895-1,71.865

and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you
my weaknesses.  WILDE-1895-1,71.866

I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it now.
WILDE-1895-1,71.867

And so, last night you ruined my life for me - yes, ruined it!
WILDE-1895-1,71.868

What this woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered
to me.  WILDE-1895-1,71.869

She offered security, peace, stability.  WILDE-1895-1,71.870

The sin of my youth, that I had thought was buried, rose up in front of
me, hideous, horrible, with its hands at my throat.  WILDE-1895-1,71.871

I could have killed it for ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed
its record, burned the one witness against me.  WILDE-1895-1,71.872

You prevented me.  No one but you, WILDE-1895-1,71.873

you know it.  WILDE-1895-1,71.874

And now what is there before me but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame,
the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured
death, it $may $be {TEXT:maybe}, some day?  WILDE-1895-1,71.875

Let women make no more ideals of men!  WILDE-1895-1,71.876

let them not put them on altars and bow before them, or they may ruin
other lives as completely as you - you whom I have so wildly loved -
have ruined mine!  WILDE-1895-1,71.877

<font> He passes from the room.  WILDE-1895-1,71.878

Lady Chiltern rushes towards him, WILDE-1895-1,71.879

but the door is closed when she reaches it.  WILDE-1895-1,71.880

Pale with anguish, bewildered, helpless, she sways like a plant in
the water.  WILDE-1895-1,71.881

Her hands, outstretched, seem to tremble in the air like blossoms in
the wind.  WILDE-1895-1,71.882

Then she flings herself down beside a sofa WILDE-1895-1,71.883

and buries her face.  WILDE-1895-1,71.884

Her sobs are like the sobs of a child.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,71.885

<heading>

Third Act.  WILDE-1895-1,72.889

Scene WILDE-1895-1,72.890

<font> The Library in Lord Goring's house.  WILDE-1895-1,72.891

An Adam room.  WILDE-1895-1,72.892

On the right is the door leading into the hall.  On the left, the door
of the smoking-room.  WILDE-1895-1,72.893

A pair of folding doors at the back open into the drawing-room.
WILDE-1895-1,72.894

The fire is lit.  WILDE-1895-1,72.895

Phipps, the Butler, is arranging some newspapers on the writing-table.
WILDE-1895-1,72.896

The distinction of Phipps is his impassivity.  WILDE-1895-1,72.897

He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler.  WILDE-1895-1,72.898

The Sphinx is not so incommunicable.  WILDE-1895-1,72.899

He is a mask with a manner.  WILDE-1895-1,72.900

Of his intellectual or emotional life, history knows nothing.
WILDE-1895-1,72.901

He represents the dominance of form.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,72.902

<$$heading>

<font> Enter Lord Goring in evening dress with a buttonhole.
WILDE-1895-1,72.904

He is wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape.  WILDE-1895-1,72.905

White-gloved, he carries a Louis Seize cane.  WILDE-1895-1,72.906

His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion.  WILDE-1895-1,72.907

One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life, makes it
indeed, and so masters it.  WILDE-1895-1,72.908

He is the first well-dressed philosopher in the history of thought.
<$$font> WILDE-1895-1,72.909

Lord Goring: Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?  WILDE-1895-1,72.910

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,72.911

<font> Takes his hat, cane, and cape, WILDE-1895-1,72.912

and presents new buttonhole on salver.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,72.913

Lord Goring: Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  WILDE-1895-1,72.914

I am the only person of the smallest importance in London at present
who wears a buttonhole.  WILDE-1895-1,72.915

<P_73>

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,73.917

I have observed that.  WILDE-1895-1,73.918

Lord Goring <font> taking out old buttonhole <$$font>: You see, Phipps.
Fashion is what one wears oneself.  WILDE-1895-1,73.919

What is unfashionable is what other people wear.  WILDE-1895-1,73.920

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,73.921

Lord Goring: Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.
Phipps: Yes, my lord.  Lord Goring <font> putting in new buttonhole
<$$font>: And falsehoods the truths of other people.  WILDE-1895-1,73.922

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,73.923

Lord Goring: Other people are quite dreadful.  WILDE-1895-1,73.924

The only possible society is oneself.  WILDE-1895-1,73.925

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,73.926

Lord Goring: To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
Phipps.  WILDE-1895-1,73.927

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,73.928

Lord Goring <font> looking at himself in the glass <$$font>:
$do $n't {TEXT:don't} think I quite like this buttonhole, Phipps.
WILDE-1895-1,73.929

Makes me look a little too old.  WILDE-1895-1,73.930

Makes me almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?  WILDE-1895-1,73.931

Phipps: I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} observe an alternation in your lordship's
appearance.  WILDE-1895-1,73.932

Lord Goring: You $do $n't {TEXT:don't}, Phipps?  WILDE-1895-1,73.933

<P_74>

Phipps: No, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,74.935

Lord Goring: I am not quite sure.  WILDE-1895-1,74.936

For the future a more trivial buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.
WILDE-1895-1,74.937

Phipps: I will speak to the florist, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,74.938

She has had a loss in her family lately, which perhaps accounts for
the lack of triviality your lordship complains of in the buttonhole.
WILDE-1895-1,74.939

Lord Goring: Extraordinary thing about the lower class in England -
they are always losing their relations.  WILDE-1895-1,74.940

Phipps: Yes, my lord!  WILDE-1895-1,74.941

They are extremely fortunate in that respect.  WILDE-1895-1,74.942

Lord Goring <font> turns round WILDE-1895-1,74.943

and looks at him.  WILDE-1895-1,74.944

Phipps remains impassive <$$font>: WILDE-1895-1,74.945

Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?  WILDE-1895-1,74.946

Phipps: Three, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,74.947

<font> Hands letters on a salver.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,74.948

Lord Goring <font> takes letters <$$font>: WILDE-1895-1,74.949

Want my cab round in twenty minutes.  WILDE-1895-1,74.950

Phipps: Yes, my lord.  WILDE-1895-1,74.951

<font> Goes towards door.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,74.952

Lord Goring <font> holds up letter in pink envelope <$$font>:
WILDE-1895-1,74.953

Ahem!  Phipps, when did this letter arrive?  WILDE-1895-1,74.954

Phipps: It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the club.
WILDE-1895-1,74.955

Lord Goring: That will do.  WILDE-1895-1,74.956

<font> Exit Phipps.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,74.957

Lady Chiltern's handwriting on Lady Chiltern's pink notepaper.
WILDE-1895-1,74.958

That is rather curious.  WILDE-1895-1,74.959

I thought Robert was to write.  WILDE-1895-1,74.960

Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got <P_75> to say to me?
WILDE-1895-1,75.961

<font> Sits at bureau, WILDE-1895-1,75.962

opens letter, WILDE-1895-1,75.963

and reads it.  <$$font> WILDE-1895-1,75.964
