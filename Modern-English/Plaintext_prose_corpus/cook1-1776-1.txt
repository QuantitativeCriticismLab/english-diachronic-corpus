<$$heading>

October 30, 1772.  COOK1-1776-1,12.5

At 8 A.M.  the <font> Resolution <$$font>, being Commodore, saluted the
fort with eleven guns, which the Governor returned.  COOK1-1776-1,12.6

In the evening a French bark arrived from the island of Mauritius.
COOK1-1776-1,12.7

October 31.  COOK1-1776-1,12.8

Unbent our sails.  COOK1-1776-1,12.9

Set up on shore the astronomer's observatory.  COOK1-1776-1,12.10

Received on board fresh meat, mutton, and soft bread for the ship's
company.  COOK1-1776-1,12.11

<P_13>

November 1.  COOK1-1776-1,13.13

Hard gales of wind.  COOK1-1776-1,13.14

Got down top-gallant-yards, COOK1-1776-1,13.15

and bent the sheet cable.  COOK1-1776-1,13.16

On the 2d got down yards and top-masts, COOK1-1776-1,13.17

and overhauled the rigging.  COOK1-1776-1,13.18

Two Dutch Indiamen arrived from Middleburg; one of which informed us
that she had been out four months, had buried 150 of her men, and had
then 60 sick in the hold: COOK1-1776-1,13.19

The other had been out six months, COOK1-1776-1,13.20

had buried 66 men, COOK1-1776-1,13.21

and was very sickly.  COOK1-1776-1,13.22

Table Bay, according to many coelestial observations made by Captain
Wallis, when on shore at Green Point, lies in Lat. 34=o=.
2'.  S. Long. from Greenwich 18=o=.  8'.  E.
COOK1-1776-1,13.23

The variation of the needle at this place was 19=o=.  30'.  W.
COOK1-1776-1,13.24

Table Bay is a good harbour in summer, but not in winter:
COOK1-1776-1,13.25

the Dutch never permit any of their ships to lie here longer than the
15th of May, which answers to our November.  COOK1-1776-1,13.26

After that time, as Captain Carteret relates, all ships go to False Bay,
which is well sheltered from the north-west winds, that blow here with
great violence.  COOK1-1776-1,13.27

The plain of Green Point is about two miles distant from Capetown.
COOK1-1776-1,13.28

The Cape of Good Hope, in Caffraria, or the country of the Hottentots,
is the most southern promontory of Africa.  COOK1-1776-1,13.29

Caffraria is a very mountainous country; COOK1-1776-1,13.30

the Table mountain near the Cape is of a very great height,
COOK1-1776-1,13.31

and the top of it is always covered with a cap of clouds before a storm.
COOK1-1776-1,13.32

There are no harbours, though there is a sea coast of a thousand miles.
COOK1-1776-1,13.33

When Commodore Byron touched at the Cape, he was obliged to work into
Table Bay with his topsails close reefed, there being a strong gale with
hard squalls at S.S.E.  COOK1-1776-1,13.34

Indeed the Cape is scarce ever free from storms a week together,
COOK1-1776-1,13.35

the winds blow hard and on every side from the vast southern ocean,
COOK1-1776-1,13.36

and the waves of the sea rise to a height never seen or experienced in
any part of Europe.  COOK1-1776-1,13.37

The Bay of Biscay, turbulent as it is, has no billows that mount like
those on this great extensive ocean.  COOK1-1776-1,13.38

Ships roll and pitch in the former to an uncommon degree,
COOK1-1776-1,13.39

and the sea has generally an angry and often a dreadful appearance;
COOK1-1776-1,13.40

but in the latter the stoutest vessels are tossed and almost literally
lifted to the skies.  COOK1-1776-1,13.41

A number of rich ships have perished on this coast: COOK1-1776-1,13.42

the Dutch have lost whole fleets even at anchor before the town,
COOK1-1776-1,13.43

and they are under a necessity of mooring their guard-ships with the
strongest chains instead of cables.  COOK1-1776-1,13.44

<P_14>

The climate is very healthy, COOK1-1776-1,14.46

the country is fine, COOK1-1776-1,14.47

and it abounds with refreshments of every kind.  COOK1-1776-1,14.48

The Company's garden is a most ravishing spot, COOK1-1776-1,14.49

and produces all the most delicious fruits of Asia and Europe:
COOK1-1776-1,14.50

It is guarded from the winds and storms coming off the ocean by hedges
of bay very thick and high, affording a most refreshing shade in the
hottest season.  COOK1-1776-1,14.51

It abounds with peaches, pomegranates, pineapples or bananas, citrons ,
lemons, oranges, the pears and apples of Europe, all excellent in their
kind, and the crimson Japan apple, appearing through the green leaves,
of all the most beautiful.  COOK1-1776-1,14.52

The Dutch have large plantations of almond trees, and many sorts of
camphire trees, COOK1-1776-1,14.53

and there is scarce a cottage without a vineyard to it.
COOK1-1776-1,14.54

Their cabbages and colliflowers weigh from thirty to forty pounds,
their potatoes from six to ten, raised from seed brought from Cyprus
and Savoy: COOK1-1776-1,14.55

Their corn is ripe in December, COOK1-1776-1,14.56

and our Christmas is the time of their harvest: COOK1-1776-1,14.57

In January they tread out their corn, COOK1-1776-1,14.58

and in February the farmers carry it to the Company's magazines.
COOK1-1776-1,14.59

They sow every kind of grain but oats.  COOK1-1776-1,14.60

Lions, tygers, leopards, elephants, and the rhinoceros, are to be found
here; the elephants very large, COOK1-1776-1,14.61

their teeth weigh from sixty to one hundred and twenty pounds.
COOK1-1776-1,14.62

The zebra, porcupine, and sea cow, which feeds on the grass and retires to
the sea for security when alarmed, are to be met with here, and amongst
the birds eagles and ostriches.  COOK1-1776-1,14.63

The Dutch keep up a body of regular forces, COOK1-1776-1,14.64

and have a strong garrison at the Cape; COOK1-1776-1,14.65

they have also a militia, a corps of men in all nations formidable in
themselves, most dreadful to an enemy, and when called out upon service
spreading destruction all around them in the height of their ungoverned
fury: COOK1-1776-1,14.66

They are withal of so restless a disposition, and so naturally inclined
for war, that like the Devonshire and Northamptonshire champions in
England, they are ever ready to solicit employment even against the
principles of their own institution.  COOK1-1776-1,14.67

November 3.  COOK1-1776-1,14.68

Arrived a small Dutch snow from Holland.  COOK1-1776-1,14.69

November 12.  COOK1-1776-1,14.70

Hoisted in the launch, COOK1-1776-1,14.71

and received on board the instruments belonging to the astronomer's
observatory.  COOK1-1776-1,14.72

While the <font> Resolution <$$font> lay at the Cape, we had pitched
a tent on shore for the ship's company occasionally to sleep in, with
<P_15> those of the <font> Adventure <$$font>, in order to make hay and
brooms for the ships.  COOK1-1776-1,15.73

One day a midshipman of the <font> Resolution <$$font> ordered a
sailor belonging to the <font> Adventure <$$font> to go on board;
COOK1-1776-1,15.74

the sailor refused to obey him, telling him,"that tho'he was an officer
of the commodore's ship, he was not <font> his <$$font> officer, and he
would not go aboard. "COOK1-1776-1,15.75

Upon this the midshipman drew his hanger COOK1-1776-1,15.76

and thrust it into the sailor's body: COOK1-1776-1,15.77

His hanger was instantly taken from him by a petty officer, and the
wounded seaman sent on board his own ship in a dangerous condition.
COOK1-1776-1,15.78

The midshipman soon after procured a small sword, COOK1-1776-1,15.79

and with it ran a black man through, who had given him some offence.
COOK1-1776-1,15.80

The man bore a very good character, COOK1-1776-1,15.81

was esteemed very honest and sober, COOK1-1776-1,15.82

had a family, COOK1-1776-1,15.83

and lived in good credit with his neighbours: COOK1-1776-1,15.84

His wounds were dressed, COOK1-1776-1,15.85

and he was carried home, but thought to be in great danger.
COOK1-1776-1,15.86

After this second coup d'eclat, the midshipman thought proper to make
his escape into the country; COOK1-1776-1,15.87

but on application to the Fiscal, he detached a party in pursuit of him,
by whom he was soon apprehended and brought back.  COOK1-1776-1,15.88

Captain Cook ordered him on board, COOK1-1776-1,15.89

and made all the reparation in his power.  COOK1-1776-1,15.90

The people were so enraged against the midshipman, that his life was in
danger, many persons having determined to kill him the first opportunity
they had.  COOK1-1776-1,15.91

This is one amongst other circumstances that will occur in the course
of this narrative, which the editor would have willingly suppressed;
COOK1-1776-1,15.92

but a journal is no journal unless all occurrences are faithfully related
, COOK1-1776-1,15.93

and a journalist as well as an historian is equally bound to observe
the following line of conduct: <font> Ne quid falsi dicere audeat,
ne quid veri non audeat.  <$$font> COOK1-1776-1,15.94

November 13.  COOK1-1776-1,15.95

The Dutch Governor at the Cape of Good Hope, and the English Consul,
came on board in order to see our still for making salt-water fresh.
COOK1-1776-1,15.96

The <font> Resolution <$$font> saluted his Excellency with 15 guns,
COOK1-1776-1,15.97

manned ship COOK1-1776-1,15.98

and gave him three cheers: COOK1-1776-1,15.99

The <font> Adventure <$$font> did the same, COOK1-1776-1,15.100

and saluted him with 9 guns.  COOK1-1776-1,15.101

The Dutch Commodore saluted him with 15 guns.  COOK1-1776-1,15.102

These ceremonies passed on his coming aboard, COOK1-1776-1,15.103

and the same honors were repeated at his departure.  COOK1-1776-1,15.104

The method of working the still is as follows: COOK1-1776-1,15.105

"At five o'clock in the morning 56 gallons of salt-water were put in
the still: COOK1-1776-1,15.106

at 7 it began to run, COOK1-1776-1,15.107

and about half an hour after twelve it afforded 42 gallons of fresh-water
, at an expence of 9 pounds of wood <P_16> and 69 pounds of coals.
COOK1-1776-1,16.108

Thirteen gallons and two quarts remained in the still, COOK1-1776-1,16.109

and that which came off had no ill taste, nor, as we had after
experienced, any hurtful quality.  COOK1-1776-1,16.110

We always used the still when we were reduced to 45 tons,
COOK1-1776-1,16.111

and preserved the rain water with the utmost diligence. "-
<font> Capt. Wallis's Voyage round the World.  <$$font>
COOK1-1776-1,16.112

This day, November 13, Mr. Burney, midshipman on board the <font>
Resolution <$$font>, was appointed by Capt. Cook a Lieutenant to
our companion the <font> Adventure.  <$$font> COOK1-1776-1,16.113

November 19.  COOK1-1776-1,16.114

Several ladies and gentlemen came off from the Cape to dine on board
and to view the ship: COOK1-1776-1,16.115

We saluted them with three cheers.  COOK1-1776-1,16.116

As a seaman was firing at a bird, his piece being overloaded, burst in
his hand, COOK1-1776-1,16.117

and carried away one finger.  COOK1-1776-1,16.118

November 22.  COOK1-1776-1,16.122

A young gentleman, a Swede, came on board, to assist Dr. Foster
and his son, as a botanist, on our voyage.  COOK1-1776-1,16.123

This day having refreshed our men and completed our wood and water,
and having taken such provisions and stores on board as we wanted, and
being ready for sea, we saluted the Fort and Governor, COOK1-1776-1,16.124

made sail, COOK1-1776-1,16.125

and proceeded on our voyage, steering southward.  COOK1-1776-1,16.126

As nothing is more engaging, or makes more lasting impressions, than
the politeness of foreigners {COM:no_open_paren;_see_errata} who are
vested with a supreme command {COM:no_close_paren;_see_errata} shewn to
such officers of different nations who occasionally touch at the several
ports where they preside, or that does more honor to the power by whom
they are employed, it would be singular injustice not to mention the very
great character given the Dutch Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, by the
Captains of the British ships, on their voyages round the world, performed
in the reign of his present Majesty George III.  COOK1-1776-1,16.127

Commodore Byron, in his Voyage, speaks of the Dutch Governor as follows
: COOK1-1776-1,16.128

<P_17>

"The next morning <paren> Feb. 14, 1766, <$$paren> {COM:sic}
I waited upon the Governor, who had sent his coach and six to the water
side for me.  COOK1-1776-1,17.130

He is an old man, COOK1-1776-1,17.131

but is a favourite with all ranks of people: COOK1-1776-1,17.132

he received me with the greatest politeness, COOK1-1776-1,17.133

and not only offered me the Company's house in the garden for my residence
while I should continue at the Cape, but his coach whenever I should
think fit to use it.  COOK1-1776-1,17.134

Having continued here three weeks, I took leave of the good old Governor
,"&c. &c. COOK1-1776-1,17.135

Had our Governors in North America imitated this bright example, and
acquired as great a popularity amongst all ranks of people where they
presided, as this venerable Hollander at the settlement of the Cape,
there had been no occasion for British swords to have been drawn, or
British bayonets to have been pointed at the breasts of fellow subjects
and countrymen, who in the last most glorious war bled at each other's
side, brave and victorious warriors, in the common cause of Great Britain
and their Sovereign.  COOK1-1776-1,17.136

Captain Wallis, in his Voyage round the World, speaks very advantageously
of the Dutch Governor at this place.  COOK1-1776-1,17.137

"We anchored on the 4th of February 1768 in Table Bay, at the Cape of
Good Hope.  COOK1-1776-1,17.138

As soon as the ship was at anchor I sent an officer on shore with the
usual compliments to the Governor, who received him with great civility,
telling him that we were welcome to all the refreshments and assistance
that the Cape afforded, and that he would return our salute with an
equal number of guns. "COOK1-1776-1,17.139

Capt. Carteret adds his testimony thus, both of country, Governor,
and inhabitants.  COOK1-1776-1,17.140

"The recovery of my people made it necessary to continue here till
January 6, 1769.  COOK1-1776-1,17.141

At this place we breathed pure air, COOK1-1776-1,17.142

had wholesome food, COOK1-1776-1,17.143

and went freely about the country, which is extremely pleasant, so that
I began to think myself already in Europe.  COOK1-1776-1,17.144

We found the inhabitants open, hospitable and polite, there being scarcely
a gentleman in the place, either in a public or private station , from
whom I did not receive some civility; COOK1-1776-1,17.145

and I should very ill deserve the favors they bestowed, if I did not
particularly mention the First and Second Governor, and the Fiscal.
"COOK1-1776-1,17.146

<P_18>

November 23.  COOK1-1776-1,18.148

This day every man on board received the King's present of a jacket and
trowsers, designed for use in the frozen ocean.  COOK1-1776-1,18.149

November 25.  COOK1-1776-1,18.150

From this day to December 9th, we had very stormy weather, hard gales
of wind, and heavy squalls of rain.  COOK1-1776-1,18.151

December 9.  COOK1-1776-1,18.152

During our run from November 25th, we split the foretop-sail,
COOK1-1776-1,18.153

and laid to under a balanced mizen, COOK1-1776-1,18.154

and battened {COM:for_battered;_see_errata} down our hatches fore and
aft; COOK1-1776-1,18.155

and our companion the <font> Adventure <$$font> laid to under a
main-topsail.  COOK1-1776-1,18.156

One night about 12 o'clock, and the middle watch, the ship's company were
alarmed with a cry that she was sinking very fast.  COOK1-1776-1,18.157

Officers and men were upon deck in an instant, COOK1-1776-1,18.158

and the consternation was great; COOK1-1776-1,18.159

the darkness of the night inspired additional horror: COOK1-1776-1,18.160

the sea broke over us every minute: COOK1-1776-1,18.161

the ship was nearly water-logged {COM:for_water-clogged;_see_errata}.
COOK1-1776-1,18.162

In this confusion ordered lights COOK1-1776-1,18.163

and went down below: COOK1-1776-1,18.164

worked the chain and hand pumps: COOK1-1776-1,18.165

at last discovered a scuttle in the boatswain's store-room that was
broke in.  COOK1-1776-1,18.166

Had it not pleased Providence to direct us in our search, and enable
us to find out this opening to the sea at the exact moment we did,
in a few minutes all discovery had been fruitless; COOK1-1776-1,18.167

the ship must have gone down, COOK1-1776-1,18.168

and every soul on board must have irretrievably perished.
COOK1-1776-1,18.169

It was with the utmost difficulty the water taken in, before the
scuttle was secured, could be pumped out and the ship cleared.

Lat. 49=o=.  39'.  S. Long. 21=o=.  20'.  E.
COOK1-1776-1,18.172

The weather became more moderate.  COOK1-1776-1,18.173

At 4 in the morning our companion the <font> Adventure <$$font> made
the signal for seeing land: COOK1-1776-1,18.174

this gave spirits to us all after our late turbulent and tempestuous
course: COOK1-1776-1,18.175

it gave us additional spirits because we were sensible it must be a new
discovery, COOK1-1776-1,18.176

but to our great mortification on approaching it nearer we found it to
be an island of ice.  COOK1-1776-1,18.177

In the afternoon the <font> Adventure <$$font> made another signal for
seeing land, which also proved as the former, an island of ice, with
this difference, that it was considerably larger, and so lofty that it
was in height equal to our top-gallant-mast head.  COOK1-1776-1,18.178

Soon after came on a thick fog: COOK1-1776-1,18.179

made a signal for our companion to come under our stern, lest we should
fall foul of each other in the fog: COOK1-1776-1,18.180

At 7 P.M.  spoke her.  COOK1-1776-1,18.181

<P_19>

December 11.  COOK1-1776-1,19.183

Sharp frosty weather.  COOK1-1776-1,19.184

At 5 in the afternoon saw an island of ice, computed to be six miles
in circumference.  COOK1-1776-1,19.185

It was now so extremely cold that we were obliged to sow up our sheep and
goats in red baize, to preserve them from the inclemency of the weather.
COOK1-1776-1,19.186

December 12.  COOK1-1776-1,19.187

Great falls of snow: extremely cold.  COOK1-1776-1,19.188

Made a signal for seeing land, COOK1-1776-1,19.189

but it proved ice.  COOK1-1776-1,19.190

At this time there were no less than seven islands of ice in sight.
COOK1-1776-1,19.191

December 14.  COOK1-1776-1,19.192

Discovered ice a-head and upon each beam as far as we could see, which
made us conclude that there must certainly be land behind it, under
which it must first contract.  COOK1-1776-1,19.193

Bore away to the leewardmost point: COOK1-1776-1,19.194

hauled up COOK1-1776-1,19.195

and ran at the back of it, COOK1-1776-1,19.196

but could discover no land.  COOK1-1776-1,19.197

Being thus disappointed of land, after so promising a prospect, we began
to despair of ever finding any to the southward.  COOK1-1776-1,19.198

December 15.  COOK1-1776-1,19.199

Sharp frosts and great snows.  COOK1-1776-1,19.200

Hoisted out a boat to try the current and to examine the state of the
air: COOK1-1776-1,19.201

by the astronomer's account it appeared to be four degrees warmer at
100 fathom under water than at the surface.  COOK1-1776-1,19.202

December 19.  COOK1-1776-1,19.203

Saw a great many whales, and islands of ice innumerable.
COOK1-1776-1,19.204

On the 20th spoke our companion.  COOK1-1776-1,19.205

On the 22d saw flocks of penguins: COOK1-1776-1,19.206

shot many of them.  COOK1-1776-1,19.207

December 29.  COOK1-1776-1,19.213

Saw an island of ice a-head: COOK1-1776-1,19.214

proposed to water the ship, COOK1-1776-1,19.215

but on approaching nearer found it too dangerous.  COOK1-1776-1,19.216

On this island were hundreds of penguins, and some animal resembling a
man: COOK1-1776-1,19.217

we fired two great shot at them, which did not appear to disturb them
in the least.  COOK1-1776-1,19.218

Saw also many whales.  COOK1-1776-1,19.219

December 31.  COOK1-1776-1,19.220

It came on to blow hard.  COOK1-1776-1,19.221

Got down top-gallant yards, COOK1-1776-1,19.222

and at 3 in the morning we were brought up by a thick field of ice,
which obliged us to tack and hand to the north west.  COOK1-1776-1,19.223

January 8, 1773.  COOK1-1776-1,19.225

Attempted to water our ship at an island of ice, COOK1-1776-1,19.226

but found it too dangerous.  COOK1-1776-1,19.227

January 9.  COOK1-1776-1,19.228

Fell in with some broken ice.  COOK1-1776-1,19.229

Pounded the ice COOK1-1776-1,19.232

and melted it in the coppers, COOK1-1776-1,19.233

<P_20>

and the water proved exceeding good.  COOK1-1776-1,20.235

On the 12th saw a seal and a sea lion.  COOK1-1776-1,20.236

On the 15th hoisted our boats COOK1-1776-1,20.237

and got more ice for water for the ship.  COOK1-1776-1,20.238

This day the ship's company was put to short allowance of bread.
COOK1-1776-1,20.239

Saw a whale.  COOK1-1776-1,20.240

January 16.  COOK1-1776-1,20.246

Hard gales of wind.  COOK1-1776-1,20.247

Got down top-gallant yards.  COOK1-1776-1,20.248

At 7 in the evening we crossed the Antartic Circle, Long. 37=o=
E. COOK1-1776-1,20.249

but could proceed no farther than Lat. 66=o=.  36'.  S.
being stopped by the great quantities of ice; COOK1-1776-1,20.250

so were obliged to tack and haul away to the northward.
COOK1-1776-1,20.251

This day saw several whales.  COOK1-1776-1,20.252

Hard gales of wind.  COOK1-1776-1,20.256

Got down top-gallant yards.  COOK1-1776-1,20.257

Saw several whales.  COOK1-1776-1,20.258

On the 27th made a signal to our companion to go three leagues to leeward
and look out.  COOK1-1776-1,20.259

At 7 in the evening we were alarmed with a fire in the fore-sail room,
which was directly over the magazine.  COOK1-1776-1,20.260

It burnt a new hawser, some sails, and the bulk-head, before we could
possibly extinguish it; which it pleased God we were so lucky to do,
COOK1-1776-1,20.261

and a great escape it was.  COOK1-1776-1,20.262

There is nothing so dreadful to seamen as fire on board a ship:
COOK1-1776-1,20.263

It is with great difficulty they can be brought to act for their own
preservation, COOK1-1776-1,20.264

and it has been known frequently to deprive them of their senses.
COOK1-1776-1,20.265

On such horrid emergencies the officers alone have, by their activity
and spirited exertions, saved the ship.  COOK1-1776-1,20.266

This day we were in Lat. 54=o=.  48'.  S.
COOK1-1776-1,20.267

January 28.  COOK1-1776-1,20.268

Made a signal for our companion to look out.  COOK1-1776-1,20.269

January 29.  COOK1-1776-1,20.270

Lat. 52=o=.  28'.  S. COOK1-1776-1,20.271

Long. 54=o=.  4'.  E. COOK1-1776-1,20.272

From the 29th of January to the 1st of February we had hard gales of wind,
sleet and rain.  COOK1-1776-1,20.273

We split the fore-stay sail and gibb.  COOK1-1776-1,20.274

On the first of February we made a signal for our companion to look out
, COOK1-1776-1,20.275

and at 7 in the evening she fired a gun, the meaning of which we could
not understand: COOK1-1776-1,20.276

she soon after bore <P_21> down COOK1-1776-1,21.277

and hailed us, COOK1-1776-1,21.278

and told us she had seen a large field of rock-weed, and some birds
very much resembling those we had seen in the English Channel.
COOK1-1776-1,21.279

We asked her latitude and longitude; COOK1-1776-1,21.280

she answered, Lat. 48=o=.  48'.  S. Long. 58=o=.
E. COOK1-1776-1,21.281

We laid to all night for fear of running upon land.  COOK1-1776-1,21.282

We asked how the weeds bore for her, COOK1-1776-1,21.283

and from her account greatly expected to find land at no great distance
, COOK1-1776-1,21.284

and cruized for it some time in vain.  COOK1-1776-1,21.285

February 5.  COOK1-1776-1,21.286

Spoke our companion again.  COOK1-1776-1,21.287

She had carried away her main-top-gallant mast in a gale of wind two
days after we spoke her before.  COOK1-1776-1,21.288

February 8.  COOK1-1776-1,21.289

It blew hard with heavy and thick rain.  COOK1-1776-1,21.290

Lost sight of our companion: COOK1-1776-1,21.291

fired guns every half hour for two days and two nights,
COOK1-1776-1,21.292

and burnt false fires, COOK1-1776-1,21.293

but never heard her answer above two or three guns.  COOK1-1776-1,21.294

We split the fore-top-gallant sail, COOK1-1776-1,21.295

and laid to under a mizen stay-sail.  COOK1-1776-1,21.296

We now gave up all thoughts of seeing our companion any more.
COOK1-1776-1,21.297

February 20.  COOK1-1776-1,21.298

Saw something on our starboard quarter that had the appearance of land:
COOK1-1776-1,21.299

tacked and stood for it, COOK1-1776-1,21.300

but soon found it to be a cloud.  COOK1-1776-1,21.301

Saw some porpoises.  COOK1-1776-1,21.302

This evening had a view of the southern lights, distinguishable, bright
and clear.  COOK1-1776-1,21.303

February 21.  COOK1-1776-1,21.304

Watered the ship from an island of ice.  COOK1-1776-1,21.305

Some of the ship's company lost the use of their limbs from the excessive
cold, COOK1-1776-1,21.306

but proper methods being taken they recovered the use of them again.
COOK1-1776-1,21.307

Indeed the whole crew were remarkably healthy, considering the severity
of the weather, and the great fatigue they underwent.  COOK1-1776-1,21.308

March 3.  COOK1-1776-1,21.309

Saw a shoal of porpoises rolling along-side the ship: COOK1-1776-1,21.310

they appeared to be curiously marked with streaks of black and white:
COOK1-1776-1,21.311

one of them was struck with a gig, COOK1-1776-1,21.312

but he broke away.  COOK1-1776-1,21.313

On the 15th carried away our studding-sail-boom in a gale.
COOK1-1776-1,21.314

On the 18th split the gibb.  COOK1-1776-1,21.315

On the 22d hard gales of wind.  COOK1-1776-1,21.316

Split the fore-top-gallant sail, COOK1-1776-1,21.317

and carried away our studding-sail-boom and yard.  COOK1-1776-1,21.318

On the 23d bent buoy-ropes, COOK1-1776-1,21.319

and made ready for seeing land.  COOK1-1776-1,21.320

March 25.  COOK1-1776-1,21.321

Lady Day.  COOK1-1776-1,21.322

This morning at 10 A.M.  discovered from the mast head several islands
belonging to New Zealand.  COOK1-1776-1,21.323

At 4 P.M.  got well in with the land COOK1-1776-1,21.324

and saw a bay a-head; COOK1-1776-1,21.325

but it appeared to be very dangerous from the <P_22> number of
rocks lying about it, some just under water, others just above it.
COOK1-1776-1,22.326

The country mountainous, the mountains covered with trees:
COOK1-1776-1,22.327

tacked and stood off all night, the weather coming on very thick and hazy.
COOK1-1776-1,22.328

We had the good fortune this afternoon to escape a sunken rock under
our bow.  COOK1-1776-1,22.329

Heavy rain and hard gales all night.  COOK1-1776-1,22.330

<heading>

<font> The <$$font> Resolution <font> arrives at <$$font> Dusky Bay,

<$$heading>

March 26.  COOK1-1776-1,22.334

The weather became more moderate.  COOK1-1776-1,22.335

At 4 o'clock, A.M.  wore ship, COOK1-1776-1,22.336

had a pleasant breeze right aft, COOK1-1776-1,22.337

and sailed into a bay with an intention to come to, COOK1-1776-1,22.338

but could get no soundings at a hundred fathoms.  COOK1-1776-1,22.339

Stood on COOK1-1776-1,22.340

and opened several other bays, COOK1-1776-1,22.341

and sailed in amongst a number of islands not above twice the ship's
length distant from each other.  COOK1-1776-1,22.342

Here we let go our anchor, in a bay named by Capt. Cook, in his
former voyage in the Endeavour, Dusky Bay, COOK1-1776-1,22.343

and steaded {COM:for_headed;_see_errata} the ship with hawsers to
the trees.  COOK1-1776-1,22.344

Thus we lay as secure and safe as possible from the wind and sea.
COOK1-1776-1,22.345

Lat. 45=o=.  47'.  S. COOK1-1776-1,22.346

Long. 193=o=.  17'.  W. COOK1-1776-1,22.347

Nothing could be more delightful than our present situation between
these islands.  All around us green trees, bushes, and flowers: the lawns
enamelled like a garden, the trees full of birds of various colours,
whose feathers expanded in the sun displayed all the radiance of gold
and silver.  COOK1-1776-1,22.348

No landscape of <font> Tesniers <$$font> or <font> Claude Loraine,
<$$font> or of any painter of the most luxuriant imagination, could
exhibit a view more beautiful, or more striking to the eye: add to which,
the sweet harmony of these feathered songsters from every branch was
ravishing beyond description; COOK1-1776-1,22.349

and withal they were so very gentle and tame, as not to stir or move
from their seats, unless disturbed by some sudden and alarming act of
hostility: COOK1-1776-1,22.350

they would even bear small stones to be thrown at them from the rude
hands of northern seamen, insensible of the music of their sweet notes,
and whose ears were unaccustomed to any whistling but that of winds and
tempests, or the shrill strains <P_23> of their own melodious boatswain,
at the meridian hour of appetite.  COOK1-1776-1,23.351

Musical inclinations, or a delight in harmony, are not at present amongst
the accomplishments of a British tar: COOK1-1776-1,23.352

there are no <font> dilettanti <$$font> or <font> connoscenti <$$font>
on the forecastle of a King's ship: COOK1-1776-1,23.353

and therefore it was, without doubt, that the Governors of the Foundling
Hospital in London, observing this defect in the service, have, in this
age of improvement and cultivation of the <font> Bon Ton, <$$font> so
wisely employed, and at a great annual expence, the most celebrated
masters, such as Signor Giardini, Dr. Burney, and others, to
instruct the children intended for the sea in that noblest of all arts,
the science of music, now become, according to them, a <font> national
concern.  <$$font> COOK1-1776-1,23.354

Knowledge of music will certainly harmonize the passions, and soften
that robust ferocity, for which our British seamen have been so long
reproached by the politer French and Spaniards.  COOK1-1776-1,23.355

In a few years, all motions on board a man of war will, probably,
be directed by the tone of musical instruments, in the same manner as
battalions of foot perform their evolutions more regularly by the slam
of a drum.  COOK1-1776-1,23.356

The capstern will heave up the anchor <font> adagio, <$$font> to the hum
of a Caledonian bagpipe; the sails be loosened and furled <font> allegro,
<$$font> to the sprightly airs of a hautboy; and the cannon be played in
full chorus, instead of barbarous broadsides, upon an approaching enemy.
COOK1-1776-1,23.357

What a martial appearance must the commander of a line of battleship
exhibit, sitting on the quarter-deck and giving orders to his intrepid
<font> stand <$$font> {COM:for_band;_see_errata} of English, by
the sudden stroke of a double bass or kettle-drum between his legs!
COOK1-1776-1,23.358

How must an enemy be struck with terror, who is received after the
first fire with a <font> catch <$$font> or a <font> glee <$$font>,
performed by <font> English Johns <$$font> in concert, instead of three
obstreperous huzzas!  COOK1-1776-1,23.359

And there is great reason to expect the British seamen will be very expert
in such salutes, under the instructions of the present philharmonic First
Lord of the Admiralty, who will, no doubt, vouchsafe his concurrence to
the <font> dilettanti <$$font> Governors of the Foundling, for promoting
this great institution in the royal fleet, and will establish, in the
room of a schoolmaster or useless mathematician, a <font> catch-master
<$$font> on board of every ship in the navy, being so good a proficient
at a <font> catch <$$font> himself.  COOK1-1776-1,23.360

Profane oaths and curses, which at present so much disgrace the service,
will <P_24> be banished from the decks and gangways of all men of war
, and every room and cabin resound with tender airs and recitativos
{COM:for_recitatives;_see_errata}.  COOK1-1776-1,24.361

Such will probably be the happy consequences of this sage institution,
adopted by the present intelligent Governors of the Foundling Hospital,
to whom this kingdom $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fail hereafter of standing
indebted for many signal victories and glorious achievements, solely
obtained by the irresistible powers of English seamen bred to music.

March 27.  COOK1-1776-1,24.366

Continued at anchor between the islands.  COOK1-1776-1,24.367

They lie in Lat. 45=o=.  S. COOK1-1776-1,24.368

New Zealand was first discovered by Abel Jansen Tasman, a Dutchman,
in the year 1642, COOK1-1776-1,24.371

but was little known till Capt. Cook's former voyage in the
Endeavour.  COOK1-1776-1,24.372

Fish we caught this day in such quantities as served the ship's whole
company, COOK1-1776-1,24.373

and they were of an exceeding good quality.  COOK1-1776-1,24.374

We shot many parrots, many large birds, and one seal.  COOK1-1776-1,24.375

The only inconvenient circumstance that attended us here was the want
of water.  COOK1-1776-1,24.376

One of our lieutenants took the pinnace COOK1-1776-1,24.377

and went in search of another place to take the ship to, where we might
be supplied with that necessary article, COOK1-1776-1,24.378

and on his return informed us he had discovered a very pleasant
cove, at a little distance, where there was plenty of good water.
COOK1-1776-1,24.379

Upon this intelligence we hove to in order to proceed to the cove
described, COOK1-1776-1,24.380

and were obliged to steer between two islands that lay so close
to each other that our yard-arms touched the trees on both sides.
COOK1-1776-1,24.381

When we approached the cove it was low water, COOK1-1776-1,24.382

and the cove was so narrow that it took the ship in like a dock.
COOK1-1776-1,24.383

We made her fast to the trees on each side, COOK1-1776-1,24.384

and the fresh water ran down in streams close under our stern.
COOK1-1776-1,24.385

We saw no inhabitants, COOK1-1776-1,24.386

but heard bitter cries in the night.  COOK1-1776-1,24.387

We carried two tents on shore, one for the cooper and brewer, and the
other for the <P_25> sail-maker: COOK1-1776-1,25.388

erected an observatory for the astronomer, COOK1-1776-1,25.389

and made pens for the sheep and goats.  COOK1-1776-1,25.390

The black flies were very numerous and very troublesome in this cove.
COOK1-1776-1,25.391

March 28.  COOK1-1776-1,25.392

The lieutenants and master took a boat to row, amongst the islands,
COOK1-1776-1,25.393

and discovering a fine sandy beach, they had intended to land upon it,
COOK1-1776-1,25.394

but suddenly they perceived a number of Indians launching their canoes
in a great hurry: COOK1-1776-1,25.395

they called to the master, who called to them again, COOK1-1776-1,25.396

and as their appearance and motions looked rather hostile, he made the
best of his way on board: COOK1-1776-1,25.397

at this time the greatest part of the ship's company were on shore bathing
, when they were alarmed with a voice from the ship, COOK1-1776-1,25.398

<font> Come on board, COOK1-1776-1,25.399

come on board, COOK1-1776-1,25.400

the Indians are coming down: <$$font> COOK1-1776-1,25.401

this put the people in a great consternation, fearing they should
come down by land and intercept them before they could reach the boat.
COOK1-1776-1,25.402

As soon as the men were all well on board we got our small arms upon
deck, COOK1-1776-1,25.403

cut lashes, COOK1-1776-1,25.404

and stood by to cut the ship adrift, in case the Indians came by land:
COOK1-1776-1,25.405

but all our precautions were unnecessary, as they seemed to be more
afraid of us than we of them.  COOK1-1776-1,25.406

We descried them peeping at the ship from the point of an island, and
in a dread lest we should perceive them.  COOK1-1776-1,25.407

This lasted for some time, after which they ventured to paddle a little
nearer to us; COOK1-1776-1,25.408

but their hearts failed them, COOK1-1776-1,25.409

and they put about COOK1-1776-1,25.410

and paddled away.  COOK1-1776-1,25.411

We saw no more of them till every body was below at dinner, when
they paddled close in shore, and had got pretty near the ship.
COOK1-1776-1,25.412

The Captain ordered a French Jack to be waved, COOK1-1776-1,25.413

and called to them; upon which they laid upon their paddles near twenty
minutes, and soon after paddled back again.  COOK1-1776-1,25.414

With our glasses we could observe them to be clothed with skins.
COOK1-1776-1,25.415

At 2 P.M.  two of our boats well armed, with the Captain and three
marines, went in search of the Indians.  COOK1-1776-1,25.416

At 6 the Captain and boats returned, with an account of their seeing
the canoes hauled upon a beach, and the Indians gone.  COOK1-1776-1,25.417

Captain Cook went into a canoe, COOK1-1776-1,25.418

and found a net and some coal-fish; COOK1-1776-1,25.419

the head of the canoe was carved, COOK1-1776-1,25.420

and resembled a man's head.  COOK1-1776-1,25.421

He saw a hut made in the form of the tilt of a waggon, with a hole to
creep in and out at, and the top covered with green boughs and leaves:
COOK1-1776-1,25.422

he did not choose to enter it, lest any Indians should be in it,
and should be alarmed at the appearance <P_26> of the men under arms,
COOK1-1776-1,26.423

so he returned to the canoe again, COOK1-1776-1,26.424

and left in her several strings of beads, knives, ribbons and
looking-glasses; COOK1-1776-1,26.425

he also cut a tree with a small axe, COOK1-1776-1,26.426

and left it sticking in the wood.  COOK1-1776-1,26.427

March 29.  COOK1-1776-1,26.428

This day the Captain called the ship's company aft, COOK1-1776-1,26.429

and spoke to them to the following effect: COOK1-1776-1,26.430

"Gentlemen, I have sent for you to acquaint you, that while we stay here,
it is my intention that the ship's company be stopped one half of their
provisions: COOK1-1776-1,26.431

here are great quantities of fish, COOK1-1776-1,26.432

and you shall have as many as you please.  COOK1-1776-1,26.433

I think this saving had better be made now, than for us to be under
a necessity of making it when we are more advanced to the southward
, and when you will have more occasion for your full allowance.
COOK1-1776-1,26.434

To put you to short allowance then would be much against my inclination
, COOK1-1776-1,26.435

and indeed I would sooner shorten our voyage if reduced to that
alternative.  COOK1-1776-1,26.436

I do not mean to stop your provisions from you entirely,
COOK1-1776-1,26.437

for you shall be paid for them; upon which consideration I hope to hear
no grumbling or discontent amongst you, COOK1-1776-1,26.438

for I promise you my officers and I will set you the example. "
COOK1-1776-1,26.439

All the people were very well satisfied, COOK1-1776-1,26.440

acquiesced cheerfully in the Captain's resolution, COOK1-1776-1,26.441

and were this day employed in felling trees: COOK1-1776-1,26.442

the ground was so moist that we could shove down trees 12 or 14 feet
high with our hands.  COOK1-1776-1,26.443

We began to brew spruce beer, COOK1-1776-1,26.444

made candles, COOK1-1776-1,26.445

and boiled the blubber of seals.  COOK1-1776-1,26.446

Got up the armourer's forge.  COOK1-1776-1,26.447

March 30.  COOK1-1776-1,26.448

Made a fire to burn and clear some ground, COOK1-1776-1,26.449

and it coming on to blow hard, all hands were obliged to go on
shore at midnight to put it out, fearing the tents should take fire.
COOK1-1776-1,26.450

April 1.  COOK1-1776-1,26.451

This afternoon the Captain went in the pinnace to the canoe again,
COOK1-1776-1,26.452

and found the beads, knives, ribbons, &c. unmoved
{COM:for_unremoved;_see_errata}, and just as he left them; by which it
appeared the Indians had never returned to the canoe from the time he
had been there before.  COOK1-1776-1,26.453

He entered the hut, COOK1-1776-1,26.454

and found a basket of berries like elder-berries, and a patoo-pattoo,
which is their chief instrument of offence in war, especially when at
close quarters.  COOK1-1776-1,26.455

Shot a seal and some ducks, COOK1-1776-1,26.456

and saw something like a jackall.  COOK1-1776-1,26.457

<P_27>

April 2.  COOK1-1776-1,27.459

Shot some plover, parrots, and seals; COOK1-1776-1,27.460

one of the latter weighed 228 lb. COOK1-1776-1,27.461

Found the head bone of a lion, or some other large beast.
COOK1-1776-1,27.462

On the 5th hard showers and storms of hail, and a great deal of thunder.
COOK1-1776-1,27.463

The climate seemed to be very tempestuous: COOK1-1776-1,27.464

we had not six hours fair weather from the time we arrived at these
islands.  COOK1-1776-1,27.465

April 6.  COOK1-1776-1,27.466

Capt. Cook went this day a reconnoitring the country in a boat,
and surveying the coast, COOK1-1776-1,27.467

and as he was returning he heard a voice on shore: COOK1-1776-1,27.468

on his approaching to it, he saw an old man, two $middle-aged
{TEXT:middle_aged} women, and a very fine young woman, appearing to be
about 18 or 19 years of age.  COOK1-1776-1,27.469

From their first discovering the boat they all seemed in great dismay,
the women especially.  COOK1-1776-1,27.470

The old man came trembling down a rock, COOK1-1776-1,27.471

and endeavoured to prevent the boat from landing, by shoving her with
a long stick.  COOK1-1776-1,27.472

When he found all his attempts to prevent our landing fruitless, he
returned to his wives, who were standing on the shore much terrified.
COOK1-1776-1,27.473

The Captain and boat's crew landed, COOK1-1776-1,27.474

and the Indians stood motionless, till the Captain advanced up to one of
the ladies and saluted her, by putting his nose to her's, according to the
custom prevailing in the late discovered countries.  COOK1-1776-1,27.475

He attempted to pay the same compliment to the other wife,
COOK1-1776-1,27.476

but could not <font> weather <$$font> a great wen that grew on her lip.
COOK1-1776-1,27.477

All this time the old man stood motionless, observing the Captain saluting
his wives: COOK1-1776-1,27.478

the Captain then turned to the old man, who looked like death, from the
fright and terror he was in, COOK1-1776-1,27.479

and presented him in a courteous manner with a knife and an axe:
COOK1-1776-1,27.480

this pleased him much, COOK1-1776-1,27.481

and he began to talk and to be very familiar.  COOK1-1776-1,27.482

By this time the ladies too had recovered from their first alarm.
COOK1-1776-1,27.483

Some of the gentlemen addressed the young beauty COOK1-1776-1,27.484

and gave her some fish and birds, which she threw back at them with
an air of disdain, and laughed at them heartily, by way of rebuke, as
we apprehended, for offering her presents in her own power to obtain.
COOK1-1776-1,27.485

She seemed to be a lass of humour and spirit, COOK1-1776-1,27.486

and assumed airs that would not have disgraced an {COM:for_a;_see_errata}
European fine lady.  COOK1-1776-1,27.487

We must not absolutely infer, from the address and manner of this fair
incognita of the south, that coquetry is a natural accomplishment to
the female sex, and because we see it so generally admitted amongst the
graces of our European beauties; COOK1-1776-1,27.488

yet it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <P_28> be denied but it is a sort of
presumptive proof of something like it, and that nature meant a little
<font> flirtation <$$font> as no <font> unbecoming <$$font> auxiliary
to a graceful person.  COOK1-1776-1,28.489

After displaying many of these delicate airs of a fine lady, our
Indiana took a great fancy to a little dog that followed the Captain.
COOK1-1776-1,28.490

In this passion too for a lap-dog she not a little resembled our European
females.  COOK1-1776-1,28.491

She took and played with the dog a considerable time, till he barked,
which so affrighted her that she let him go, and would never suffer
him to come near her afterwards, but kept as far from him as possible.
COOK1-1776-1,28.492

From this it may be judged there were none of that species of animals
in these islands.  COOK1-1776-1,28.493

Dr. Foster fired at a bird on a bush COOK1-1776-1,28.494

and killed it: COOK1-1776-1,28.495

this alarmed our Indians still more.  COOK1-1776-1,28.496

They took particular notice of the Captain's boat-cloak,
COOK1-1776-1,28.497

and seemed very desirous to have it.  COOK1-1776-1,28.498

Our draftsman being present at this pantomimical conference, which
was totally carried on by signs and tokens, took out his pencil
COOK1-1776-1,28.499

and drew the picture of this young Indian beauty.  COOK1-1776-1,28.500

When he had finished it, he shewed it her, at which she seemed wonderfully
pleased, and expressed a strong inclination to have it in her possession.
COOK1-1776-1,28.501

The Captain soon after took his leave for that time COOK1-1776-1,28.502

and returned on board.  COOK1-1776-1,28.503

The ladies, at this <font> rencontre <$$font>, were armed with spears,
and the old gentleman with a patoo-pattoo.  COOK1-1776-1,28.504

April 8.  COOK1-1776-1,28.505

This day the Captain went on shore again at the same place,
COOK1-1776-1,28.506

and presented the old gentleman with a cloak of kersey, as he had before
shewed a desire of having the Captain's boat-cloak: COOK1-1776-1,28.507

the Captain put this kersey cloak upon him, COOK1-1776-1,28.508

and he seemed highly delighted with it, strutting up and down, and
thinking himself exceeding fine.  COOK1-1776-1,28.509

The Indians presented the Captain, in return, with some skins of
albitrosses.  COOK1-1776-1,28.510

This day they had four beautiful children with them.  COOK1-1776-1,28.511

As soon as the Captain and company got into the boat to go on board,
they all ascended a rock, COOK1-1776-1,28.512

and sat upon it, looking after the boat till she was out of sight.
COOK1-1776-1,28.513

We shot, while on shore, some parrots, shags, ducks, and cavallas.
COOK1-1776-1,28.514

April 11.  COOK1-1776-1,28.515

Sunday.  COOK1-1776-1,28.516

Easter-Day, and the first fine day we have had since we have been at
these islands.  COOK1-1776-1,28.517

At 10, A.M.  discovered a double canoe at a distance.  COOK1-1776-1,28.518

The Indians in her paddled till they came within a quarter of a mile
<P_29> of the ship, when the Captain took a boat and went out to sea to
meet them.  COOK1-1776-1,29.519

Upon approaching the canoe the Captain found the old gentleman and his
family in it; COOK1-1776-1,29.520

so he sent the boat on board, COOK1-1776-1,29.521

and took a paddle COOK1-1776-1,29.522

and paddled with them, expecting he should prevail upon them to come on
board the <font> Resolution <$$font>, COOK1-1776-1,29.523

but he soon found their intentions were to go into a cove;
COOK1-1776-1,29.524

upon this he left them.  COOK1-1776-1,29.525

As soon as they had taken care of their canoes they all came
COOK1-1776-1,29.526

and sat on a rock within view of the ship: COOK1-1776-1,29.527

they seemed to be afraid of the ship, COOK1-1776-1,29.528

and thought it was alive, COOK1-1776-1,29.529

and began to talk to it as a living creature.  COOK1-1776-1,29.530

The old gentleman pointed to the masts and sails, and several things on
board, COOK1-1776-1,29.531

and then turned COOK1-1776-1,29.532

and spoke to his children, as making his remarks on what he saw.
COOK1-1776-1,29.533

The children appeared to be struck with amazement, COOK1-1776-1,29.534

and looked as if their father had been acquainting them with danger.
COOK1-1776-1,29.535

We played the fife and bagpipes, COOK1-1776-1,29.536

beat the drum, COOK1-1776-1,29.537

and rang the bell; COOK1-1776-1,29.538

they all looked at one another with surprize, but with visible
satisfaction and pleasure in their countenances, COOK1-1776-1,29.539

and soon after manifested their joy by dancing and hallooing:
COOK1-1776-1,29.540

in the mean time a man went up to the main-top-gallant truck
COOK1-1776-1,29.541

and called to them: COOK1-1776-1,29.542

they all suddenly stopped dancing, COOK1-1776-1,29.543

and stood gazing at him with evident marks of wonder.  COOK1-1776-1,29.544

At night they made a great fire, COOK1-1776-1,29.545

and all sat round about it singing.  COOK1-1776-1,29.546

The Captain ordered centinels {COM:sic} to be posted, lest any of the
seamen should go on shore and take away the old gentleman's daughter.
COOK1-1776-1,29.547

Our boats were this day employed in fishing, COOK1-1776-1,29.548

and several sharks and dog-fish were taken.  COOK1-1776-1,29.549

The first and second lieutenant, a master's mate and midshipman, went in a
small cutter on a party of pleasure among the islands, COOK1-1776-1,29.550

and took three days provision with them.  COOK1-1776-1,29.551

April 12.  COOK1-1776-1,29.552

To-day the old Indian and his family quitted the cove COOK1-1776-1,29.553

and went up the country.  COOK1-1776-1,29.554

The Captain shot 15 seals, COOK1-1776-1,29.555

and as he was out surveying the coast and islands he perceived a boat
at sea: COOK1-1776-1,29.556

rowed to her COOK1-1776-1,29.557

and found it to be our cutter adrift in which the lieutenants had been
, and with all the provisions in her they had taken from the ship:
COOK1-1776-1,29.558

the Captain took her in tow with the pinnace, COOK1-1776-1,29.559

and soon after proceeded in search of his lieutenants.
COOK1-1776-1,29.560

At three in the morning he discovered a fire on a little island:
COOK1-1776-1,29.561

rowed to it COOK1-1776-1,29.562

and landed.  COOK1-1776-1,29.563

Here he found the lieutenants and their companions, all <P_30> sitting
round the fire without either provisions or liquor, COOK1-1776-1,30.564

nor had they had any for 18 or 20 hours before.  COOK1-1776-1,30.565

The Captain staid with them till day-light, COOK1-1776-1,30.566

and then left them.  COOK1-1776-1,30.567

We caught a great many craw-fish in this place.  COOK1-1776-1,30.568

April 15.  COOK1-1776-1,30.569

This day the Captain went a surveying again in the pinnace,
COOK1-1776-1,30.570

and while he was out found a black dog, that we had brought from the
Cape of Good Hope, and had lost him on an island about ten or eleven
days before: COOK1-1776-1,30.571

he was in good condition, and fat, considering he had been his own
provider all the time.  COOK1-1776-1,30.572

The Captain on his return brought on board plenty of ducks, water-hens,
curlews, parrots, hawks, shags, and seals.  COOK1-1776-1,30.573

He saw some Indians at a great distance, COOK1-1776-1,30.574

but they never made up to him.  COOK1-1776-1,30.575

April 18.  COOK1-1776-1,30.576

This day the old Indian and his family came into the cove again,
COOK1-1776-1,30.577

and made fires to cook their dinner: COOK1-1776-1,30.578

this was done by fixing four forked sticks in the ground, then placing
sticks across and laying their fish on, scales and guts and all, after
cleaning and rolling them up in sea-weed.  COOK1-1776-1,30.579

Their bread is made of roots of fern burnt.  COOK1-1776-1,30.580

In the dusk of the evening one of the women went up the island to gather
sticks, COOK1-1776-1,30.581

and was followed by one of the seamen: COOK1-1776-1,30.582

when she returned the old gentleman beat her, being somewhat jealous,
and perhaps not without reason: COOK1-1776-1,30.583

upon this the daughter began to beat him, in revenge for the ill usage
to her mother, COOK1-1776-1,30.584

but soon after, recollecting her want of filial duty to her father,
and seeming conscious of the impropriety of her behaviour, she turned
her back to him, COOK1-1776-1,30.585

and he beat her.  COOK1-1776-1,30.586

Then they all appeared to be sulky and displeased, COOK1-1776-1,30.587

and spoke to each other no more that evening.  COOK1-1776-1,30.588

April 19.  COOK1-1776-1,30.589

Hauled the seine COOK1-1776-1,30.590

and caught 400 mackarel.  COOK1-1776-1,30.591

Early this morning the old gentleman and his daughter, being now
reconciled, walked together round the cove, with their spears in their
hands, COOK1-1776-1,30.592

and came to the tents, COOK1-1776-1,30.593

and soon after they visited the ship.  COOK1-1776-1,30.594

When the old man approached the ship he made a long speech,
COOK1-1776-1,30.595

spoke very loud, COOK1-1776-1,30.596

and when he had finished it, he and the young lady his daughter came
on board.  COOK1-1776-1,30.597

As soon as they were upon deck, they both jumped, to see if the deck
was fast and was strong enough to bear them, COOK1-1776-1,30.598

then walked very lightly upon it, as if afraid that it should give way
and fall in with them.  COOK1-1776-1,30.599

The Captain carried <P_31> them into the cabin, COOK1-1776-1,31.600

and they visited the gun room also; COOK1-1776-1,31.601

but the old gentleman never lost sight of Miss, COOK1-1776-1,31.602

nor would permit her to go any where without him.  COOK1-1776-1,31.603

They made presents to the Captain and to the draftsman of new dresses
of the country, COOK1-1776-1,31.604

and in return the Captain gave the father two axes, a gouge and firmer ,
COOK1-1776-1,31.605

and presented the young lady with a pompone, with which she seemed
highly delighted.  COOK1-1776-1,31.606

Observing some red paint in a pot, they took a brush COOK1-1776-1,31.607

and painted their faces.  COOK1-1776-1,31.608

In this too our Indian beauty imitated the taste of European ladies.
COOK1-1776-1,31.609

It has been generally supposed that our British Fair had been indebted
to the French or Italian ladies of quality, for this embellishment of
their complexions; COOK1-1776-1,31.610

but the present instance before us will shew, that nature had instructed
an unpolished Indian in the same fashionable practice, without the aid
of foreign artists.  COOK1-1776-1,31.611

Our Indiana had decorated her head with feathers, now become a British
fashion also.  COOK1-1776-1,31.612

When they had satisfied their curiosity in viewing every part of the ship,
and were convinced that it was not alive, nor endued with the faculties
of a human being, as they first thought, and which more particularly
appeared by the old gentleman's addressing it in a long speech before
he came on board, they took their leaves of the Captain and officers
upon deck, COOK1-1776-1,31.613

and returned to their canoes.  COOK1-1776-1,31.614

The thought of the ship's being alive must be very natural to those who
never saw or heard of a ship before, COOK1-1776-1,31.615

and therefore it is not at all surprising that the Indians supposed this
to be the case of the <font> Resolution.  <$$font> COOK1-1776-1,31.616

Mr. Dryden has given a very animated picture of an Indian
describing to Montezuma the Spanish squadron on their first approach
to Mexico, in which this thought is illustrated with particular beauty.
COOK1-1776-1,31.617

The Indian is represented as relating to his Emperor this strange
phenomenon, and announcing the arrival of the Spanish ships on his coast
as follows: {COM:verse_omitted} COOK1-1776-1,31.618

<P_32>

April 22.  COOK1-1776-1,32.620

The Captain went in the pinnace, surveying the coast and making
observations.  COOK1-1776-1,32.621

Saw three men and two women, who expressed the same fear at seeing him
as the old gentleman and his ladies: COOK1-1776-1,32.622

however he soon made friends with them, COOK1-1776-1,32.623

and presented them with two axes; COOK1-1776-1,32.624

in return they gave him one of their dresses.  COOK1-1776-1,32.625

This was the last intercourse we had with the natives at this cove.
COOK1-1776-1,32.626

On the 24th the Captain put two ganders and two geese on shore
COOK1-1776-1,32.627

and left them to breed.  COOK1-1776-1,32.628

On the 28th struck the tents, COOK1-1776-1,32.629

and brought every thing on board ready to sail.  COOK1-1776-1,32.630

April 29.  COOK1-1776-1,32.631

The Captain went on shore COOK1-1776-1,32.632

and sowed many sorts of seeds, soon after which we hauled out of the
cove and made sail: COOK1-1776-1,32.633

sailed about ten miles $inland {TEXT:in_land} COOK1-1776-1,32.634

and then came to.  COOK1-1776-1,32.635

Saw many lights on the mountains at night.  COOK1-1776-1,32.636

April 30.  COOK1-1776-1,32.637

At 10 A.M.  hove up, COOK1-1776-1,32.638

and towed till 6 in the evening, COOK1-1776-1,32.639

and came to again.  COOK1-1776-1,32.640

May 1.  COOK1-1776-1,32.641

At 7 A.M.  hove up, COOK1-1776-1,32.642

turned, COOK1-1776-1,32.643

and came to again at one, so close to the shore that we entangled our
ensign-staff amongst the trees.  COOK1-1776-1,32.644

Got some water, COOK1-1776-1,32.645

and found two huts uninhabited.  COOK1-1776-1,32.646

May 3.  COOK1-1776-1,32.647

At 11 A.M.  hove up, COOK1-1776-1,32.648

but there being but little wind came to again.  COOK1-1776-1,32.649

On the 4th, hove up again at noon, COOK1-1776-1,32.650

and came to at 3 o'clock: COOK1-1776-1,32.651

hauled the seine COOK1-1776-1,32.652

and caught a few small fish, COOK1-1776-1,32.653

and found a muscle the shell of which was twelve inches long and eight
broad.  COOK1-1776-1,32.654

This night was very tempestuous; thunder, lightning and rain during the
whole of it.  COOK1-1776-1,32.655

May 5.  COOK1-1776-1,32.656

At 3 P.M.  got under way, COOK1-1776-1,32.657

and came to at 7 in a fine bay near the main ocean.  COOK1-1776-1,32.658

From the time we discovered these islands and made the land, we had
not one week in the whole that could be fairly termed good weather.
COOK1-1776-1,32.659

May 6.  COOK1-1776-1,32.660

Continued at anchor in the bay: COOK1-1776-1,32.661

caught a shark with 27 eggs in her.  COOK1-1776-1,32.662

On the 7th hard gales of wind.  COOK1-1776-1,32.663

Got our lower yards and top-gallant masts down.  COOK1-1776-1,32.664

On the 9th hoisted in our boats COOK1-1776-1,32.665

and made ready for sea.  COOK1-1776-1,32.666

This day shot two seals.  COOK1-1776-1,32.667

Weighed COOK1-1776-1,33.673

and put to sea.  COOK1-1776-1,33.674

This day killed twelve seals.  COOK1-1776-1,33.675

On the 15th came in sight of Cape <font> Farewell.  <$$font>
COOK1-1776-1,33.676

On the 16th hard gales of wind, with heavy rain.  COOK1-1776-1,33.677

Turned all day and night to weather the Cape, and to enter the Sound.
COOK1-1776-1,33.678

May 17.  COOK1-1776-1,33.679

This morning the weather became very fine, COOK1-1776-1,33.680

and the wind being right aft, we soon got sight of the western entrance
of the Sound: COOK1-1776-1,33.681

but all on a sudden we were taken a-back, COOK1-1776-1,33.682

the clouds put on a very threatening appearance, COOK1-1776-1,33.683

the sky looked black and louring, COOK1-1776-1,33.684

and the face of the heavens seemed to portend some dreadful event.
COOK1-1776-1,33.685

We made haste to prepare against it: COOK1-1776-1,33.686

lowered down our top-sails, COOK1-1776-1,33.687

hauled down all the stay-sails, COOK1-1776-1,33.688

and clewed up the courses; COOK1-1776-1,33.689

and having taken these necessary precautions, waited the approaching
storm with firmness.  COOK1-1776-1,33.690

It was not long before we saw the water at a distance in great motion ,
the waves rising to an uncommon height, and the whole sea in one continued
ferment: COOK1-1776-1,33.691

the astronomer, from the dreadful prospect before us and the vast swell
of the ocean, judged it to be a whirlwind coming on.  COOK1-1776-1,33.692

Soon after we saw the sea drawn up, as it were, into the clouds, and
forming two tremendous columns of water, resembling water-spouts of an
inconceivable size: COOK1-1776-1,33.693

scarce were these formed and suspended in the air, when three others,
still more formidable in their appearance, began to gather nearer to
the ship, and one so very near as to strike us all with the greatest
consternation and horror.  COOK1-1776-1,33.694

It was now a dead calm, COOK1-1776-1,33.695

the ship could not be moved, COOK1-1776-1,33.696

and there seemed no visible possibility of avoiding it.
COOK1-1776-1,33.697

It came fast towards us; COOK1-1776-1,33.698

the approach was dreadful, COOK1-1776-1,33.699

and it was preceded by loud peals of thunder and fiery slashes of forked
lightning.  COOK1-1776-1,33.700

We gave up all for lost, COOK1-1776-1,33.701

and patiently resigned ourselves to our fate, having no hopes but in
the all-gracious dispensations of Providence to relieve us in our great
extremity.  COOK1-1776-1,33.702

Just as this <P_34> dreadful column advanced within twice the length
of the ship, threatening to break and to overwhelm us in an instant, it
pleased God, that merciful disposer of all human events, to send a sudden
breeze of wind, which put the ship in motion, then wafted us briskly
along, and in a few moments cleared us of all danger.  COOK1-1776-1,34.703

The whole was a dismal scene to behold, while it lasted;
COOK1-1776-1,34.704

to those on shore, and near the Sound, it must have been a grand
spectacle: COOK1-1776-1,34.705

Phenomena of this extraordinary nature could not fail of inspiring
that secret fearful pleasure, so beautifully described by Lucretius.
COOK1-1776-1,34.706

{COM:verse_omitted}

May 18.  COOK1-1776-1,34.708

At day break saw great flashes of fire in the Sound, supposed to be of
lightning, the tempest having now reached the land.  COOK1-1776-1,34.709

Fired a gun.  COOK1-1776-1,34.710

Saw more violent flashes of lightning at the upper end of the Sound,
COOK1-1776-1,34.711

and heard explosions.  COOK1-1776-1,34.712

The storm having subsided, and it falling little wind, we hoisted out
our boats to tow, COOK1-1776-1,34.713

and towed into the Sound.  COOK1-1776-1,34.714

Here to our great joy we discovered our long lost companion the <font>
Adventure <$$font>, Captain Furneaux, laying at anchor, with her yards and
top-masts down and all her running-rigging unreefed.  COOK1-1776-1,34.715

<font> The <$$font> Resolution <font> and <$$font> Adventure <font>

<$$heading>

As soon as the <font> Resolution <$$font> came to, the <font> Adventure
<$$font> sent her boat on board, COOK1-1776-1,34.720

and informed us of the health and condition of the ship,
COOK1-1776-1,34.721

and gave the following intelligence of what passed since the separation
of the two ships. "That, at the time the <font> Adventure <$$font> parted
company, she cruized for 14 days successively, firing guns continually and
burning false fires every night; after which time, despairing of joining
us any more, they proceeded to Van Diemen's land <paren> discovered
in 1642 <$$paren> Lat. 38=o=.  S. Long. 210=o=.
W. COOK1-1776-1,34.722

There they lay in a commodious bay, COOK1-1776-1,34.723

and saw a great number of Indians: COOK1-1776-1,34.724

the water there was very brackish.  COOK1-1776-1,34.725

They had no intercourse with the Indians, COOK1-1776-1,34.726

but when they departed from <P_35> the island they left a cask at the
watering place, COOK1-1776-1,35.727

and wrote upon it, <font> The Adventure is sailed for Charlotte Sound.
<$$font> COOK1-1776-1,35.728

That they never expected to see us any more during the voyage, and that
Captain Furneaux had intended to winter in the Sound, and to return to
England in the spring by the way of Cape Horn;"and which he afterwards
did upon a second separation.  COOK1-1776-1,35.729

May 19.  COOK1-1776-1,35.730

The two ships continued at anchor in the Sound.  COOK1-1776-1,35.731

Queen Charlotte's Sound, and the land forming the harbour, called by the
natives Totarranue, was discovered and taken possession of by Capt.
Cook, in his former voyage.  COOK1-1776-1,35.732

His method of taking possession is thus related by himself:
COOK1-1776-1,35.733

"I took a post to the highest part of the island, on Tuesday, January 30,
1770, COOK1-1776-1,35.734

and after fixing it firmly in the ground I hoisted upon it the union
flag, COOK1-1776-1,35.735

and honoured this inlet with the name of Queen Charlotte's Sound, at
the same time taking formal possession of this and the adjacent country
in the name and for the use of his Majesty King George the Third.
COOK1-1776-1,35.736

We then drank a bottle of wine to her Majesty's health.
COOK1-1776-1,35.737

The land about this Sound, which is of such a height that we saw it
at the distance of twenty leagues, consists wholly of high hills and
deep vallies, well stored with a variety of excellent timber, fit
for all purposes except masts, for which it is too hard and heavy.
"COOK1-1776-1,35.738

This day the two Captains went up the river in the <font> Resolution
<$$font>'s pinnace, well armed, to look for some Indians, who had visited
Captain Furneaux a few days before, and offered some human flesh to sell.
COOK1-1776-1,35.739

It is a practice on this coast for the Indians to eat the bodies of
their enemies killed in battle.  COOK1-1776-1,35.740

This Captain Cook had discovered in his former voyage, COOK1-1776-1,35.741

and there were incontestible proofs of it: COOK1-1776-1,35.742

he saw several human bones picked of the flesh, COOK1-1776-1,35.743

and one of the Indians brought him four heads of their enemies, who had
been killed and eaten, one of which was purchased by Mr. Banks, but
with great reluctance on the part of the seller, it being supposed they
are kept as trophies, like the scalps in America.  COOK1-1776-1,35.744

The two Captains returned without seeing any of the Indians,
COOK1-1776-1,35.745

but saw several <font> hippahs <$$font> {COM:for_hippacks;_see_errata}
or villages.  COOK1-1776-1,35.746

They shot and brought on board plenty of wild fowl, some wild celery
, <P_36> scurvy-grass, and other herbs for the ship's company.
COOK1-1776-1,36.747

We saw a long canoe in the offing full of Indians.  COOK1-1776-1,36.748

Hauled the seine COOK1-1776-1,36.749

and caught some gurnets, coal-fish, cavallas, silver and elephant fish.
COOK1-1776-1,36.750

May 21.  COOK1-1776-1,36.751

Sent our boat to assist our companion the <font> Adventure <$$font>
in watering, and making ready for sea.  COOK1-1776-1,36.752

On the 23d three canoes came down COOK1-1776-1,36.753

and traded with fish for nails.  COOK1-1776-1,36.754

On the 24th one of the canoes came on board, COOK1-1776-1,36.755

and soon after another entered the Sound, COOK1-1776-1,36.756

but on seeing the two ships at anchor they put back again.
COOK1-1776-1,36.757

One of the Indians on board hailed the canoes, COOK1-1776-1,36.758

and called them along-side, COOK1-1776-1,36.759

but we could not persuade them to come on board.  COOK1-1776-1,36.760

This canoe was thirty feet long, COOK1-1776-1,36.761

and had twelve men, women, and children in her.  COOK1-1776-1,36.762

They traded tools of jasper for glass bottles, nails, and beads,
COOK1-1776-1,36.763

and scarcely refused any thing, whether of use or curiosity:
COOK1-1776-1,36.764

we bought of them seventy-five silver fish for two nails.
COOK1-1776-1,36.765

Shot this day several owls.  COOK1-1776-1,36.766

May 29.  COOK1-1776-1,36.767

A canoe came off with sixteen men, women, and children, to trade.
COOK1-1776-1,36.768

As theft is natural to all the natives of these islands, they were
detected presently in stealing a four-hour glass, a scraper, a fork,
and a lamp full of oil; COOK1-1776-1,36.769

this last discovered them, the oil running down the legs of the thief
from under his cloaths.  COOK1-1776-1,36.770

In order to convince them that theft was a crime, and would
not be permitted with impunity, we turned them out of the ship,
COOK1-1776-1,36.771

and handed them into the canoe a little roughly.  COOK1-1776-1,36.772

At this they seemed surprised COOK1-1776-1,36.773

and expressed some resentment, COOK1-1776-1,36.774

but soon after paddled away COOK1-1776-1,36.775

and went on board the <font> Adventure, <$$font> some of the seamen
of which found a deep sea lead, which they had stolen from us, at the
bottom of the canoe.  COOK1-1776-1,36.776

Their canoe was thirty-two feet long, and the heads curiously carved.
COOK1-1776-1,36.777

They offered to sell their children for one shirt each,
COOK1-1776-1,36.778

but the Captain would not permit any one to purchase them.
COOK1-1776-1,36.779

June 1.  COOK1-1776-1,36.780

This day three sailing canoes came down the river to trade:
COOK1-1776-1,36.781

they had on board twenty-seven men and some very handsome young women.
COOK1-1776-1,36.782

The faces of the men were marked and blackened with many streaks in a very
curious manner, which denoted them to be warriors.  COOK1-1776-1,36.783

All the prisoners they take in war they kill and eat, COOK1-1776-1,36.784

and when they have taken more than are required for the present
subsistence, <P_37> they tie their hands and legs together,
COOK1-1776-1,37.785

then bind them fast to a tree, COOK1-1776-1,37.786

and leave them till they are wanted for the table.  COOK1-1776-1,37.787

As soon as these unfortunate captives have fallen a victim to the savage
appetites of their literally blood-thirsty conquerors, and their horrid
repast is over, they proceed to knock out all their teeth and draw the
nails from off their fingers, COOK1-1776-1,37.788

then boring holes through them, they hang them to their ears
COOK1-1776-1,37.789

and wear them as trophies of victory.  COOK1-1776-1,37.790

We purchased of these inhuman warriors teeth and finger-nails, and
fish-hooks made of men's bones.  COOK1-1776-1,37.791

We also bought of them chissels {COM:sic} and axes made of green jasper
curiously wrought.  COOK1-1776-1,37.792

It chills the blood with horror to reflect on the dreadful situation of
those devoted natives whom the chance of war had thrown into the power
of their enemies, tied to a tree, exposed to the scorching heat of the
sun, to hunger and to thirst, and in daily expectation of the knife.
COOK1-1776-1,37.793

It is rather wonderful that frequent retaliations have not in a length
of time abolished and put an end to so barbarous a custom, considering
the uncertainties ever attending all hostile conflicts, and the chances
of being attacked by superior numbers, of being overpowered or surprized.
COOK1-1776-1,37.794

Dr. Hawkesworth imputes this barbarous custom principally to the
great want of provisions on this island, there being no sheep, or goats,
or hogs, or cattle; and that hunger stimulates to this savage practice.
COOK1-1776-1,37.795

In the evening the canoes departed, COOK1-1776-1,37.796

but left some of their cannibals on board the ship: COOK1-1776-1,37.797

we made beds for them in the hog-stye, with which they were much
delighted, COOK1-1776-1,37.798

rose in the morning, COOK1-1776-1,37.799

and breakfasted on the heads and guts of wild fowl, raw and unwashed.
COOK1-1776-1,37.800

They took great pleasure in pulling and hauling, and doing any thing
they saw done by the seamen.  COOK1-1776-1,37.801

June 2.  COOK1-1776-1,37.802

The Captain put on shore two goats COOK1-1776-1,37.803

and left them to breed.  COOK1-1776-1,37.804

June 3.  COOK1-1776-1,37.805

Our largest cutter went nine miles up a river, to bring on board some hay,
which we had made some days before; COOK1-1776-1,37.806

but on her passage was chaced by a double war canoe, which carried
sixty-six Indians.  COOK1-1776-1,37.807

The cutter being unarmed, was obliged to put about and return to the ship.
COOK1-1776-1,37.808

Being well armed and manned she set out again in pursuit of her pursuers
; COOK1-1776-1,37.809

but the war canoe observing her motions, had sheered off
COOK1-1776-1,37.810

and was out of sight.  COOK1-1776-1,37.811

In the evening two Indians fought <P_38> on shore, COOK1-1776-1,38.812

and one killed the other, which was no sooner done but the deceased was
dragged to a fire and broiled for supper.  COOK1-1776-1,38.813

Turned a boar and sow loose upon the island, COOK1-1776-1,38.814

and left them to breed.  COOK1-1776-1,38.815

June 4.  COOK1-1776-1,38.816

This being The King's Birth-Day, all the officers of the <font>
Adventure <$$font> dined on board our ship to celebrate the day.
COOK1-1776-1,38.817

At 8 in the morning a double war canoe came down; COOK1-1776-1,38.818

at this time we had ten or twelve Indians on board: COOK1-1776-1,38.819

As soon as they saw the war canoe they ran up and down the ship like
distracted people, not knowing which way to escape.  COOK1-1776-1,38.820

This is not much to be wondered at, considering the fate they were
reserved for in case they had been taken.  COOK1-1776-1,38.821

When the war canoe approached the ship, the Indians on board put
themselves in the best posture of defence they could with our gig-staffs
and their own patoo-pattoos, as if determined to sell their lives dear.
COOK1-1776-1,38.822

When the canoe was alongside, two of the chiefs, cloathed in the skins
of wild beasts, rose up COOK1-1776-1,38.823

and made a very long harangue.  COOK1-1776-1,38.824

During this speech our Indians were very attentive, COOK1-1776-1,38.825

and as soon as the warriors prepared to come on board the ship, they
slipped over the other side, COOK1-1776-1,38.826

got safe on shore, COOK1-1776-1,38.827

and ran up the mountains with all the speed they could; by this stratagem
and their own activity, thus preserving their bones from being picked
by their hungry and voracious adversaries.  COOK1-1776-1,38.828
