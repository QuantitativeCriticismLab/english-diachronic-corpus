Thoughts on the Education of Daughters.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,1.3

The nursery.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,1.4

<$$heading>

As I conceive it to be the duty of every rational creature to attend
to its offspring, I am sorry to observe, that reason and duty together
have not so powerful an influence over <P_2> human conduct, as instinct
has in the brute creation.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,2.6

Indolence, and a thoughtless disregard of every thing, except the
present indulgence, make many mothers, who may have momentary starts of
tenderness, neglect their children.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,2.7

They follow a pleasing impulse, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,2.8

and never reflect that reason should cultivate and govern those
instincts which are implanted in us to render the path of duty pleasant
- WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,2.9

for if they are not governed they will run wild; and strengthen
the passions which are ever endeavouring to obtain dominion -
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,2.10

I mean vanity and self-love.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,2.11

<P_3>

The first thing to be attended to, is laying the foundation of a good
constitution.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,3.13

The mother <paren> if there are not very weighty reasons to prevent her
<$$paren> ought to suckle her children.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,3.14

Her milk is their proper nutriment, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,3.15

and for some time is quite sufficient.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,3.16

Were a regular mode of suckling adopted, it would be far from being a
laborious task.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,3.17

Children, who are left to the care of ignorant nurses, have their
stomachs overloaded with improper food, which turns acid, and renders
them very uncomfortable.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,3.18

We should be particularly careful to guard them in their infant state
from bodily pain; as their minds can then afford them no <P_4> amusement
to alleviate it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.19

The first years of a child's life are frequently made miserable through
negligence or ignorance.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.20

Their complaints are mostly in their stomach or bowels;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.21

and these complaints generally arise from the quality and quantity of
their food.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.22

The suckling of a child also excites the warmest glow of tenderness -
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.23

Its dependant {COM:sic}, helpless state produces an affection, which
may properly be termed maternal.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.24

I have even felt it, when I have seen a mother perform that office;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.25

and am of opinion, that maternal tenderness arises quite as much from
habit as instinct.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,4.26

It is possible, I <P_5> am convinced, to acquire the affection of a
parent for an adopted child; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.27

it is necessary, therefore, for a mother to perform the office of one,
in order to produce in herself a rational affection for her offspring.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.28

Children very early contract the manners of those about them.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.29

It is easy to distinguish the child of a well-bred person, if it is not
left entirely to the nurse's care.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.30

These women are of course ignorant, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.31

and to keep a child quiet for the moment, they humour all its little
caprices.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.32

Very soon does it begin to be perverse, and eager to be gratified in
every thing.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,5.33

The usual <P_6> mode of acting is complying with the humours sometimes,
and contradicting them at others - just according to the dictates of an
uncorrected temper.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,6.34

This the infant finds out earlier than can be imagined,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,6.35

and it gives rise to an affection devoid of respect.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,6.36

Uniformity of conduct is the only feasible method of creating both.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,6.37

An inflexible adherence to any rule that has been laid down makes children
comfortable, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,6.38

and saves the mother and nurse much trouble, as they will not often
contest, if they have not once conquered.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,6.39

They will, I am sure, love and respect a person who treats them
properly, if some one else does <P_7> not indiscreetly indulge them.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,7.40

I once heard a judicious father say,"He would treat his child as he
would his horse: first convince it he was its master, and then its
friend. "WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,7.41

But yet a rigid style of behaviour is by no means to be adopted;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,7.42

on the contrary, I wish to remark, that it is only in the years of
childhood that the happiness of a human being depends entirely on
others - and to embitter those years by needless restraint is cruel.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,7.43

To conciliate affection, affection must be shown,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,7.44

and little proofs of it ought always to be given -
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,7.45

let them not appear weaknesses, and they will sink deep into the
young mind, and call <P_8> forth its most amiable propensities.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.46

The turbulent passions may be kept down till reason begins to dawn.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.47

In the nursery too, they are taught to speak; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.48

and there they not only hear nonsense, but that nonsense retailed out
in such silly, affected tones as must disgust; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.49

- yet these are the tones which the child first imitates,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.50

and its innocent playful manner renders them tolerable, if not pleasing
; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.51

but afterwards they are not easily got the better of -
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.52

nay, many women always retain the pretty prattle of the nursery,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.53

and do not forget to lisp, when they have learnt to languish.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,8.54

<P_9>

Children are taught revenge and lies in their very cradles.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,9.56

If they fall down, or strike their heads against any thing, to quiet them
they are bid return the injury, and their little hands held out to do it.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,9.57

When they cry, or are troublesome, the cat or dog is chastised, or some
bugbear called to take them away; which only terrifies them at first,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,9.58

for they soon find out that the nurse means nothing by these dreadful
threatenings.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,9.59

Indeed, so well do they discover the fallacy, that I have seen little
creatures, who could scarcely speak, play over the same tricks with
their doll or the cat.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,9.60

<P_10>

How, then, when the mind comes under discipline, can precepts of truth
be inforced {COM:sic}, when the first examples they have had would lead
them to practise the contrary?  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,10.62

<P_11>

<heading>

Moral Discipline.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,11.65

<$$heading>

It has been asserted,"That no being, merely human, could properly educate
a child. "WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,11.67

I entirely coincide with this author; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,11.68

but though perfection $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be attained, and unforeseen
events will ever govern human conduct, yet still it is our duty to
lay down some rule to regulate our actions by, and to adhere to it, as
consistently as our infirmities will permit.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,11.69

To be able to follow Mr. Locke's system <paren> and this may be
said of almost all treatises on education <$$paren> the parents must
have subdued their own passions, <P_12> which is not often the case in
any considerable degree.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.70

The marriage state is too often a state of discord;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.71

it does not always happen that both parents are rational,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.72

and the weakest have it in their power to do most mischief.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.73

How then are the tender minds of children to be cultivated?
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.74

- Mamma is only anxious that they should love her best,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.75

and perhaps takes pains to sow those seeds, which have produced such
luxuriant weeds in her own mind.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.76

Or, what still more frequently occurs, the children are at first made
play-things of, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,12.77

and <P_13> when their tempers have been spoiled by indiscreet indulgence,
they become troublesome, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.78

and are mostly left with servants; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.79

the first notions they imbibe, therefore, are mean and vulgar.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.80

They are taught cunning, the wisdom of that class of people,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.81

and a love of truth, the foundation of virtue, is soon obliterated from
their minds.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.82

It is, in my opinion, a well-proved fact, that principles of truth
are innate.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.83

Without reasoning we assent to many truths; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.84

we feel their force, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.85

and artful sophistry can only blunt those feelings which
nature has implanted in us as instinctive guards to virtue.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,13.86

Dissimulation and cunning will soon drive all other <P_14> good qualities
before them, and deprive the mind of that beautiful simplicity, which
can never be too much cherished.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,14.87

Indeed it is of the utmost consequence to make a child artless,
or to speak with more propriety, not to teach them to be otherwise;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,14.88

and in order to do so we must keep them out of the way of bad examples.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,14.89

Art is almost always practised by servants, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,14.90

and the same methods which children observe them to use, to shield
themselves from blame, they will adopt - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,14.91

and cunning is so nearly allied to falsehood, that it will infallibly
lead to it - <P_15> or some foolish prevaricating subterfuge will occur,
to silence any reproaches of the mind which may arise, if an attention
to truth has been inculcated.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,15.92

Another cause or source of art is injudicious correction.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,15.93

Accidents or giddy tricks are too frequently punished,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,15.94

and if children can conceal these, they will, to avoid chastisement.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,15.95

Restrain them, therefore, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,15.96

but never correct them without a very sufficient cause; such as a
violation of truth, cruelty to animals, inferiors, or those kind of
follies which lead to vice.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,15.97

<P_16>

Children should be permitted to enter into conversation;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,16.99

but it requires great discernment to find out such subjects as will
gradually improve them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,16.100

Animals are the first objects which catch their attention;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,16.101

and I think little stories about them would not only amuse but
instruct at the same time, and have the best effect in forming
the temper and cultivating the good dispositions of the heart.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,16.102

There are many little books which have this tendency.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,16.103

One in particular I recollect: The Perambulations of a Mouse.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,16.104

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} here help mentioning a book of hymns, in
measured prose, written by the ingenious author <P_17> of many other
proper lessons for children.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.105

These hymns, I imagine, would contribute to fill the heart with religious
sentiments and affections; and, if I may be allowed the expression,
make the Deity obvious to the senses.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.106

The understanding, however, should not be overloaded any more than
the stomach.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.107

Intellectual improvements, like the growth and formation of the body,
must be gradual - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.108

yet there is no reason why the mind should lie fallow, while its" frail
tenement"is imperceptibly fitting itself for a more reasonable inhabitant.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.109

It will not lie fallow; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.110

promiscuous seeds will be sown by accident, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,17.111

and they will shoot up <P_18> with the wheat, and perhaps never be
eradicated.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.112

Whenever a child asks a question, it should always have a reasonable
answer given it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.113

Its little passions should be engaged.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.114

They are mostly fond of stories, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.115

and proper ones would improve them even while they are amused.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.116

Instead of these, their heads are filled with improbable tales, and
superstitious accounts of invisible beings, which breed strange prejudices
and vain fears in their minds.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.117

The lisp of the nursery is confirmed, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.118

and vulgar phrases are acquired; which children, if possible, should
never hear.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,18.119

<P_19>

To be able to express the thoughts with facility and propriety, is of
great consequence in life, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,19.121

and if children were never led astray in this particular, it would
prevent much trouble.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,19.122

The riot too of the kitchen, or any other place where children are left
only with servants, makes the decent restraint of the parlour irksome.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,19.123

A girl, who has vivacity, soon grows a romp; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,19.124

and if there are male servants, they go out a walking with them,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,19.125

and will frequently take little freedoms with Miss, the bearing
with which gives a forwardness to her air, and makes her pert.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,19.126

The becoming modesty, <P_20> which being accustomed to converse
with superiors, will give a girl, is entirely done away.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,20.127

I must own, I am quite charmed when I see a sweet young creature,
shrinking as it were from observation, and listening rather than talking.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,20.128

It is possible a girl may have this manner without having a very good
understanding.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,20.129

If it should be so, this diffidence prevents her from being troublesome.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,20.130

It is the duty of a parent to preserve a child from receiving wrong
impressions.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,20.131

- As to prejudices, the first notions we have deserve that name;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,20.132

for it is not till we begin to waver in our <P_21> opinions, that we
exert our reason to examine them - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.133

and then, if they are received, they may be called our own.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.134

The first things, then, that children ought to be encouraged to observe
, are a strict adherence to truth; a proper submission to superiors;
and condescension to inferiors.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.135

These are the main articles; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.136

but there are many others, which compared to them are trivial, and yet
are of importance.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.137

It is not pleasing to see a child full of bows and grimaces;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.138

yet they need not be suffered to be rude.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.139

They should be employed, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,21.140

and such fables and tales may be culled out for them as would <P_22>
excite their curiosity.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.141

A taste for the beauties of nature should be very early cultivated:
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.142

many things, with respect to the vegetable and animal world, may be
explained in an amusing way; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.143

and this is an innocent source of pleasure within every one's reach.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.144

Above all, try to teach them to combine their ideas.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.145

It is of more use than can be conceived, for a child to learn to compare
things that are similar in some respects, and different in others.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.146

I wish them to be taught to think - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.147

thinking, indeed, is a severe exercise, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,22.148

and exercise of either mind or body will not at first be entered on,
but <P_23> with a view to pleasure.  Not that I would have them make
long reflections; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,23.149

for when they do not arise from experience, they are mostly absurd.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,23.150

<P_24>

<heading>

Exterior Accomplishments.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,24.153

<$$heading>

Under this head may be ranked all those accomplishments which merely
render the person attractive; and those half-learnt ones which do not
improve the mind.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,24.155

"A little learning of any kind is a dangerous thing;"
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,24.156

and so far from making a person pleasing, it has the contrary effect.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,24.157

Parents have mostly some weighty {TEXT:weighty_weighty} business in hand,
which they make a pretext to themselves for neglecting the arduous task
of educating their children; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,24.158

they are therefore sent <P_25> to school, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.159

and the allowance for them is so low, that the person who undertakes
the charge must have more than she can possibly attend to;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.160

of course, the mechanical parts of education can only be observed.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.161

I have known children who could repeat things in the order they learnt
them, that were quite at a loss when put out of the beaten track.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.162

If the understanding is not exercised, the memory will be employed to
little purpose.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.163

Girls learn something of music, drawing, and geography;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.164

but they do not know enough to engage their attention, and render it an
employment of the mind.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,25.165

If they can play over a few <P_26> tunes to their acquaintance; and have
a drawing or two <paren> half done by the master <$$paren> to hang up in
their rooms, they imagine themselves artists for the rest of their lives.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,26.166

It is not the being able to execute a trifling landscape, or any thing
of the kind, that is of consequence - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,26.167

These are at best but trifles, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,26.168

and the foolish, indiscriminate praises which are bestowed on them only
produce vanity.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,26.169

But what is really of no importance, when considered in this light,
becomes of the utmost, when a girl has a fondness for the art, and a
desire of excellence.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,26.170

Whatever tends to make a person in some measure independent <P_27>
of the senses, is a prop to virtue.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.171

Amusing employments must first occupy the mind;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.172

and as an attention to moral duties leads to piety, so whoever weighs
one subject will turn to others, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.173

and new ideas will rush into the mind.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.174

The faculties will be exercised, and not suffered to sleep, which will
give a variety to the character.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.175

Dancing and elegance of manners are very pleasing, if too great a stress
is not laid on them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.176

These acquirements catch the senses, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.177

and open the way to the heart; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.178

but unsupported by solid good qualities, their reign is short.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,27.179

The lively thoughtlessness of youth makes every young creature agreeable
<P_28> for the time; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,28.180

but when those years are flown, and sense is not substituted
in the stead of vivacity, the follies of youth are acted over,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,28.181

and they never consider, that the things which please in their proper
season, disgust out of it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,28.182

It is very absurd to see a woman, whose brow time has marked
with wrinkles, aping the manners of a girl in her teens.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,28.183

I do not think it foreign to the present subject to mention the trifling
conversations women are mostly fond of.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,28.184

In general, they are prone to ridicule.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,28.185

As they lay the greatest stress on manners, the most respectable
characters <P_29> will not escape its lash, if deficient in this article.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.186

Ridicule has been, with some people, the boasted test of truth -
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.187

if so, our sex ought to make wonderful improvements;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.188

but I am apt to think, they often exert this talent till they lose all
perception of it themselves.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.189

Affectation, and not ignorance, is the fair game for ridicule;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.190

and even affectation some good-natured persons will spare.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.191

We should never give pain without a design to amend.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.192

Exterior accomplishments are not to be despised, if the acquiring of
them does not satisfy the possessors, and prevent their cultivating the
more important ones.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,29.193

<P_30>

<heading>

Artificial Manners.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.196

<$$heading>

It may be thought, that artificial manners and exterior accomplishments
are much the same; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.198

but I think the former take a far wider range, and are materially
different.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.199

The one arises from affectation, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.200

and the other seems only an error in judgment.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.201

The emotions of the mind often appear conspicuous in the countenance
and manner.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.202

These emotions, when they arise from sensibility and virtue, are
inexpressibly pleasing.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.203

But it is easier to copy the cast of countenance, than to cultivate the
virtues which animate and improve it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,30.204

<P_31>

How many people are like whitened sepulchres, and careful only about
appearances!  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,31.206

yet if we are too anxious to gain the approbation of the world, we must
often forfeit our own.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,31.207

How bewitching is that humble softness of manners which humility gives
birth to, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,31.208

and how faint are the imitations of affectation!
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,31.209

That gentleness of behaviour, which makes us courteous to all, and
that benevolence, which makes us loth to offend any, and studious
to please every creature, is sometimes copied by the polite;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,31.210

but how aukward {COM:sic} is the copy!  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,31.211

The warmest professions of regard are prostituted <P_32> on all occasions.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.212

No distinctions are made, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.213

and the esteem which is only due to merit, appears to be lavished on
all - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.214

Nay, affection is affected; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.215

at least, the language is borrowed, when there is no glow of it in
the heart.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.216

Civility is due to all, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.217

but regard or admiration should never be expressed when it is not felt.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.218

As humility gives the most pleasing cast to the countenance, so from
sincerity arises that artlessness of manners which is so engaging.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.219

She who suffers herself to be seen as she really is, can never be
thought affected.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.220

She is not solicitous to act a part; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,32.221

her endeavour <P_33> is not to hide; but correct her failings,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.222

and her face has of course that beauty, which an attention to the mind
only gives.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.223

I never knew a person really ugly, who was not foolish or vicious;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.224

and I have seen the most beautiful features deformed by passion and vice.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.225

It is true, regular features strike at first; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.226

but it is a well ordered mind which occasions those turns of
expression in the countenance, which make a lasting impression.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.227

Feeling is ridiculous when affected; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.228

and even when felt, ought not to be displayed.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.229

It will appear if genuine; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,33.230

but when pushed forward to notice, it is obvious vanity has rivalled
sorrow, <P_34> and that the prettiness of the thing is thought of.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.231

Let the manners arise from the mind, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.232

and let there be no disguise for the genuine emotions of the heart.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.233

Things merely ornamental are soon disregarded,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.234

and disregard can scarcely be borne when there is no internal support.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.235

To have in this uncertain world some stay, which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be undermined, is of the utmost consequence; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.236

and this stay it is, which gives that dignity to the manners, which
shews that a person does not depend on mere human applause for comfort
and satisfaction.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,34.237

Dress WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.240

<$$heading>

Many able pens have dwelt on the peculiar foibles of our sex.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.242

We have been equally desired to avoid the two extremes in dress,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.243

and the necessity of cleanliness has been insisted on,"As from the body's
purity the mind receives a sympathetic aid. " WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.244

By far too much of a girl's time is taken up in dress.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.245

This is an exterior accomplishment; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.246

but I chose to consider it by itself.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.247

The body hides the mind, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.248

and it is, in its turn, obscured by the drapery.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,35.249

I hate to see the frame of a picture so glaring, as to <P_36> catch the
eye and divide the attention.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,36.250

Dress ought to adorn the person, and not rival it.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,36.251

It may be simple, elegant, and becoming, without being expensive;
and ridiculous fashions disregarded, while singularity is avoided.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,36.252

The beauty of dress <paren> I shall raise astonishment by saying so
<$$paren> is its not being conspicuous one way or the other; when it
neither distorts, or hides the human form by unnatural protuberances.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,36.253

If ornaments are much studied, a consciousness of being well dressed
will appear in the face - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,36.254

and surely this mean pride does not give much sublimity to it.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,36.255

<P_37>

"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. "
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,37.257

And how much conversation does dress furnish, which surely
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be very improving or entertaining.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,37.258

It gives rise to envy, and contests for trifling superiority,
which do not render a woman very respectable to the other sex.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,37.259

Arts are used to obtain money; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,37.260

and much is squandered away, which if saved for charitable purposes
, might alleviate the distress of many poor families, and soften
the heart of the girl who entered in to such scenes of woe.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,37.261

<P_38>

In the article of dress may be included the whole tribe of beauty-washes
, cosmetics, Olympian dew, oriental herbs, liquid bloom, and the
paint which enlivened Ninon's face, and bid defiance to time.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,38.263

These numerous and essential articles are advertised in so
ridiculous a style, that the rapid sale of them is a very severe
reflection on the understanding of those females who encourage it.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,38.264

The dew and herbs, I imagine, are very harmless,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,38.265

but I do not know whether the same may be said of the paint.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,38.266

White is certainly very prejudicial to the health,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,38.267

and never can be made to resemble nature.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,38.268

The red, too, takes <P_39> off from the expression of the countenance,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.269

and the beautiful glow which modesty, affection, or any other emotion
of the mind, gives, can never be seen.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.270

It is not"a mind-illumined face. "WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.271

"The body does not charm, because the mind is seen,"but just the contrary;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.272

and if caught by it a man marries a woman thus disguised, he may chance
not to be satisfied with her real person.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.273

A made-up face may strike visitors, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.274

but will certainly disgust domestic friends.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.275

And one obvious inference is drawn, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.276

truth is not expected to govern the inhabitant of so artificial a form.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,39.277

The false life with which rouge animates the eyes, is not of the <P_40>
most delicate kind; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.278

nor does a woman's dressing herself in a way to attract languishing
glances, give us the most advantageous opinion of the purity of her mind.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.279

I forgot to mention powder among the deceptions.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.280

It is a pity that it should be so generally worn.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.281

The most beautiful ornament of the features is disguised, and the shade it
would give to the countenance entirely lost.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.282

The color of every person's hair generally suits the complexion,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.283

and is calculated to set it off.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.284

What absurdity then do they run into, who use red, blue, and yellow
powder!  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.285

- And what a false taste does it exhibit!  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,40.286

<P_41>

The quantity of pomatum is often disgusting.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,41.288

We laugh at the Hottentots, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,41.289

and in some things adopt their customs.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,41.290

Simplicity of Dress, and unaffected manners, should go together.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,41.291

They demand respect, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,41.292

and will be admired by people of taste, even when love is out of the
question.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,41.293

<P_42>

The Fine Arts.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.295

Music and painting, and many other ingenious arts, are now brought to
great perfection, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.296

and afford the most rational and delicate pleasure.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.297

It is easy to find out if a young person has a taste for them.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.298

If they have, do not suffer it to lie dormant.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.299

Heaven kindly bestowed it, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.300

and a great blessing it is; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.301

but, like all other blessings, may be perverted:
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.302

yet the intrinsic value is not lessened by the perversion.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,42.303

Should nature have been a niggard to them in this respect, persuade
<P_43> them to be silent, and not feign raptures they do not feel;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.304

for nothing can be more ridiculous.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.305

In music I prefer expression to execution.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.306

The simple melody of some artless airs has often soothed my mind, when
it has been harrassed by care; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.307

and I have been raised from the very depths of sorrow, by the sublime
harmony of some of Handel's compositions.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.308

I have been lifted above this little scene of grief and care, and mused
on Him, from whom all bounty flows.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.309

A person must have sense, taste, and sensibility, to render their music
interesting.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,43.310

<P_44>

The nimble dance of the fingers may raise wonder, but not delight.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,44.312

As to drawing, those $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be really charmed by it
, who do not observe the beauties of nature, and even admire them.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,44.313

If a person is fond of tracing the effects of the passions, and marking
the appearances they give to the countenance, they will be glad to see
characters displayed on canvass, and enter into the spirit of them;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,44.314

but if by them the book of nature has not been read, their admiration
is childish.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,44.315

<P_45>

Works of fancy are very amusing, if a girl has a lively fancy;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.317

but if she makes others do the greatest part of them, and only
wishes for the credit of doing them, do not encourage her.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.318

Writing may be termed a fine art; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.319

and, I am sure, it is a very useful one.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.320

The style in particular deserves attention.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.321

Young people are very apt to substitute words for sentiments, and clothe
mean thoughts in pompous diction.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.322

Industry and time are necessary to cure this, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.323

and will often do it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.324

Children should be led into correspondences, and methods adopted to make
them write down their sentiments, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,45.325

and <P_46> they should be prevailed on to relate the stories they have
read in their own words.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,46.326

Writing well is of great consequence in life as to our temporal interest,
and of still more to the mind; as it teaches a person to arrange their
thoughts, and digest them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,46.327

Besides, it forms the only true basis of rational and elegant
conversation.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,46.328

Reading, and such arts as have been already mentioned, would fill up
the time, and prevent a young person's being lost in dissipation,
which enervates the mind, and often leads to improper connections.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,46.329

When habits are fixed, and a character in some measure formed, the
entering into the <P_47> busy world, so far from being dangerous,
is useful.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,47.330

Knowledge will imperceptibly be acquired, and the taste improved
, if admiration is not more sought for than improvement.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,47.331

For those seldom make observation who are full of themselves.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,47.332

<P_48>

<heading>

Reading.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,48.335

<$$heading>

It is an old, but a very true observation, that the human mind must ever
be employed.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,48.337

A relish for reading, or any of the fine arts, should be cultivated very
early in life; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,48.338

and those who reflect can tell, of what importance it is for the mind
to have some resource in itself, and not to be entirely dependant on
the sense for employment and amusement.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,48.339

If it unfortunately is so, it must submit to meanness, and often to vice,
in order to gratify them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,48.340

The wisest and best are too much under their influence;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,48.341

and the endeavouring to conquer them, <P_49> when reason and virtue will
not give their sanction, constitutes great part of the warfare of life.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,49.342

What support, then, have they who are all sense, and who
are full of schemes, which terminate in temporal objects?
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,49.343

Reading is the most rational employment, if people seek food for the
understanding, and do not read merely to remember words; or with a view
to quote celebrated authors, and retail sentiments they do not understand
or feel.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,49.344

Judicious books enlarge the mind WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,49.345

and improve the heart, though some, by them,"are made coxcombs whom
nature meant for fools. "WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,49.346

<P_50>

Those productions which give a wrong account of the human passions, and
the various accidents of life, ought not to be read before the judgment
is formed, or at least exercised.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,50.348

Such accounts are one great cause of the affectation of young women.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,50.349

Sensibility is described and praised, and the effects of it represented
in a way so different from nature, that those who imitate it must make
themselves very ridiculous.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,50.350

A false taste is acquired, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,50.351

and sensible books appear dull and insipid after those superficial
performances, which obtain their full end if they can keep the mind in
a continual ferment.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,50.352

Gallantry is made the only interesting <P_51> subject with the novelist;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.353

reading, therefore, will often co-operate to make his fair admirers
insignificant.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.354

I do not mean to recommend books of an abstracted or grave cast.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.355

There are in our language many, in which instruction and amusement are
blended; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.356

the Adventurer is of this kind.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.357

I mention this book on account of its beautiful allegories and affecting
tales, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.358

and similar ones may easily be selected.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.359

Reason strikes most forcibly when illustrated by the brilliancy of fancy.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.360

The sentiments which are scattered may be observed,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,51.361

and when they are relished, and the <P_52> mind set to work, it may be
allowed to chuse books for itself, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,52.362

for every thing will then instruct.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,52.363

I would have every one try to form an opinion of an author
themselves, though modesty may restrain them from mentioning it.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,52.364

Many are so anxious to have the reputation of taste, that they only praise
the authors whose merit is indisputable.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,52.365

I am sick of hearing of the sublimity of Milton, the elegance and
harmony of Pope, and the original, untaught genius of Shakespear.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,52.366

These cursory remarks are made by some who know nothing of nature, and
could not enter into the <P_53> spirit of those authors, or understand
them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,53.367

A florid style mostly passes with the ignorant for fine writing;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,53.368

many sentences are admired that have no meaning in them, though
they contain"words of thundering sound,"and others that have
nothing to recommend them but sweet and musical terminations.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,53.369

Books of theology are not calculated for young persons;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,53.370

religion is best taught by example.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,53.371

The Bible should be read with particular respect,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,53.372

and they should not be taught reading by <P_54> so sacred a book; lest
they might consider that as a task, which ought to be a source of the
most exalted satisfaction.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,54.373

It may be observed, that I recommend the mind's being put into a proper
train, and then left to itself.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,54.374

Fixed rules $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be given, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,54.375

it must depend on the nature and strength of the understanding;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,54.376

and those who observe it can best tell what kind of cultivation will
improve it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,54.377

The mind is not, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be created by the teacher
, though it may be cultivated, and its real powers found out.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,54.378

The active spirits of youth may make time glide away without intellectual
<P_55> enjoyments; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.379

but when the novelty of the scene is worn off, the want of them will be
felt, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.380

and nothing else can fill up the void.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.381

The mind is confined to the body, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.382

and must sink into sensuality; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.383

for it has nothing to do but to provide for it,"how it shall eat and
drink, and wherewithal it shall be clothed. " WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.384

All kinds of refinement have been found fault with for increasing our
cares and sorrows; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.385

yet surely the contrary effect also arises from them.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.386

Taste and thought open many sources of pleasure, which do not depend
on fortune.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,55.387

<P_56>

No employment of the mind is a sufficient excuse for neglecting domestic
duties, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,56.389

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} conceive that they are incompatible.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,56.390

A woman may fit herself to be the companion and friend of a man of sense
, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,56.391

and yet know how to take care of his family.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,56.392

<heading>

Boarding-schools.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.395

<$$heading>

If a mother has leisure and good sense, and more than one daughter,
I think she could best educate them herself; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.397

but as many family reasons render it necessary sometimes to send them
from home, boarding-schools are fixed on.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.398

I must own it is my opinion, that the manners are too much attended to
in all schools; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.399

and in the nature of things it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be otherwise,
as the reputation of the house depends upon it, and most people can
judge of them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.400

The temper is neglected, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.401

the same lessons are taught to all, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,57.402

and some get a smattering <P_58> of things they have not capacity ever
to understand; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,58.403

few things are learnt thoroughly, but many follies contracted
, and an immoderate fondness for dress among the rest.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,58.404

To prepare a woman to fulfil the important duties of a wife and mother,
are certainly the objects that should be in view during the early period
of life; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,58.405

yet accomplishments are most thought of, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,58.406

and they, and all-powerful beauty, generally gain the heart;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,58.407

and as the keeping of it is not considered of until it is lost, they
are deemed of the most consequence.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,58.408

A sensible governess $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attend to the <P_59> minds
of the number she is obliged to have.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,59.409

She may have been many years struggling to get established,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,59.410

and when fortune smiles, does not chuse to lose the opportunity of
providing for old age; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,59.411

therefore continues to enlarge her school, with a view to accumulate a
competency for that purpose.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,59.412

Domestic concerns $can $not {TEXT:cannot} possibly be made a part
of their employment, or proper conversation often entered on.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,59.413

Improper books will by stealth be introduced, and the bad example
of one or two vicious children, in the play-hours, infect a number.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,59.414

Their gratitude and tenderness are not called forth in the way they
might be by <P_60> maternal affection.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,60.415

Many miseries does a girl of mild disposition suffer, which a tender
parent could guard her from.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,60.416

I shall not contest about the graces, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,60.417

but the virtues are best learnt at home, if a mother will give up her
time and thoughts to the task; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,60.418

but if she $can $not {TEXT:cannot}, they should be sent to school;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,60.419

for people who do not manage their children well, and have not large
fortunes, must leave them often with servants, where they are in danger
of still greater corruptions.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,60.420

The Temper.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.423

<$$heading>

The forming of the temper ought to be the continual thought, and the
first task of a parent or teacher.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.425

For to speak moderately, half the miseries of life arise from peevishness
, or a tyrannical domineering temper.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.426

The tender, who are so by nature, or those whom religion has moulded
with so heavenly a disposition, give way for the sake of peace -
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.427

yet still this giving way undermines their domestic comfort,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.428

and stops the current of affection; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.429

they labor for patience, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.430

and labor is ever painful.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,61.431

<P_62>

The governing of our temper is truly the business of our whole lives;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.433

but surely it would very much assist us if we were early put into the
right road.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.434

As it is, when reason gains some strength, she has mountains of rubbish
to remove, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.435

or perhaps exerts all her powers to justify the errors of folly and
passion, rather than root them out.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.436

A constant attention to the management of the temper produces gentleness
and humility, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.437

and is practised on all occasions, as it is not done"to be seen of
men. "WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.438

This meek spirit arises from good sense and resolution,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,62.439

and should not be confounded with indolence <P_63> and timidity; weakness
of mind, which often pass for good nature.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,63.440

She who submits, without conviction, to a parent or husband, will as
unreasonably tyrannise over her servants; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,63.441

for slavish fear and tyranny go together.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,63.442

Resentment, indeed, may and will be felt occasionally by the best of
human beings; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,63.443

yet humility will soon conquer it, and convert scorn and contempt into
pity, and drive out that hasty pride which is always guarding Self from
insult; which takes fire on the most trivial occasions, and which will
not admit of a superior, or even an equal.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,63.444

With such a temper is often joined that bashful aukwardness {COM:sic}
which arises <P_64> from ignorance, and is frequently termed diffidence
; but which does not, in my opinion, deserve such a distinction.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.445

True humility is not innate, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.446

but like every other good quality must be cultivated.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.447

Reflection on miscarriages of conduct, and mistakes in opinion, sink it
deep into the mind; especially if those miscarriages and mistakes have
been a cause of pain - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.448

when we smart for our folly we remember it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.449

Few people look into their own hearts, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.450

or think of their tempers, though they severely censure others, on whose
side they say the fault always lies.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,64.451

Now I am apt to believe, that <P_65> there is not a temper in the
world which does not need correction, and of course attention.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,65.452

Those who are termed good-humored {COM:sic}, are frequently giddy,
indolent, and insensible; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,65.453

yet because the society they mix with appear seldom displeased with
a person who does not contest, and will laugh off an affront, they
imagine themselves pleasing, when they are only not disagreeable.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,65.454

Warm tempers are too easily irritated.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,65.455

The one requires a spur, the other a rein.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,65.456

Health of mind, as well as body, must in general be obtained by
patient submission to self-denial, and disagreeable operations.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,65.457

<P_66>

If the presence of the Deity be inculcated and dwelt on till an habitual
reverence is established in the mind, it will check the sallies of
anger and sneers of peevishness, which corrode our peace, and render us
wretched, without any claim to piety.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,66.459

The wisdom of the Almighty has so ordered things, that one cause produces
many effects.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,66.460

While we are looking into another's mind, and forming their temper,
we are insensibly correcting our own; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,66.461

and every act of benevolence which we exert to our fellow-creatures,
does ourselves the most essential services.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,66.462

Active virtue <P_67> fits us for the society of more exalted beings.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,67.463

Our $philanthropy {TEXT:philanthrophy} is a proof, we are told, that we
are capable of loving our Creator.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,67.464

Indeed this divine love, or charity, appears to me the principal
trait that remains of the illustrious image of the Deity, which
was originally stampt on the soul, and which is to be renewed.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,67.465

Exalted views will raise the mind above trifling cares, and the many
little weaknesses, which make us such a torment to ourselves and others.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,67.466

Our temper will gradually improve, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,67.467

and vanity, which"the creature is made subject to,"has not an entire
dominion.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,67.468

<P_68>

But I have digressed.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.470

A judicious parent can only manage a child in this important article;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.471

and example will best enforce precept.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.472

Be careful, however, not to make hypocrites; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.473

smothered flames will blaze out with more violence for having been
kept down.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.474

Expect not to do all yourself; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.475

experience must enable the child to assist you;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.476

you can only lay the foundation, or prevent bad propensities from settling
into habits.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,68.477

<heading>

Unfortunate Situation of Females, fashionably educated, and left without
a Fortune.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,69.480

<$$heading>

I have hitherto only spoken of those females, who will have a provision
made for them by the parents.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,69.482

But many who have been well, or at least fashionably educated, are left
without a fortune, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,69.483

and if they are not entirely devoid of delicacy, they must frequently
remain single.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,69.484

Few are the modes of earning a subsistence, and these very humiliating.
Perhaps to be an humble companion to some rich old cousin, or what is
still <P_70> worse, to live with strangers, who are so intolerably
tyrannical, that none of their own relations can bear to live
with them, though they should even expect a fortune in reversion.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,70.485

It is impossible to enumerate the many hours of anguish such a person
must spend.  Above the servants, yet considered by them as a spy, and
ever reminded of her inferiority when in conversation with the superiors.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,70.486

If she $can $not {TEXT:cannot} condescend to mean flattery, she has not
a chance of being a favorite; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,70.487

and should any of the visitors take notice of her, and she for a
moment forget her subordinate state, she is sure to be reminded of it.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,70.488

<P_71>

Painfully sensible to unkindness, she is alive to every thing,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.490

and many sarcasms reach her, which were perhaps directed another way.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.491

She is alone, shut out from equality and confidence,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.492

and the concealed anxiety impairs her constitution;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.493

for she must wear a cheerful face, or be dismissed.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.494

The being dependant on the caprice of a fellow-creature, though certainly
very necessary in this state of discipline, is yet a very bitter
corrective, which we would fain shrink from.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.495

A teacher at a school is only a kind of upper servant, who has more work
than the menial ones.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,71.496

<P_72>

A governess to young ladies is equally disagreeable.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.498

It is ten to one if they meet with a reasonable mother;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.499

and if she is not so, she will be continually finding fault to prove
she is not ignorant, and be displeased if her pupils do not improve
, but angry if the proper methods are taken to make them do so.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.500

The children treat them with disrespect, and often with insolence.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.501

In the mean time life glides away, and the spirits with it;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.502

"and when youth and genial years are flown,"they have nothing to subsist
on; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.503

or, perhaps, on some extraordinary occasion, some small
allowance may be made for them, which is thought a great charity.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,72.504

<P_73>

The few trades which are left, are now gradually falling into the hands
of the men, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,73.506

and certainly they are not very respectable.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,73.507

It is hard for a person who has a relish for polished society, to herd
with the vulgar, or to condescend to mix with her former equals when
she is considered in a different light.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,73.508

What unwelcome heart-breaking knowledge is then poured in on her!
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,73.509

I mean a view of the selfishness and depravity of the world;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,73.510

for every other acquirement is a source of pleasure, though they may
occasion temporary inconveniences.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,73.511

How cutting is the contempt <P_74> she meets with!
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.512

- A young mind looks round for love and friendship;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.513

but love and friendship fly from poverty: WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.514

expect them not if you are poor!  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.515

The mind must then sink into meanness, and accommodate itself to its
new state, or dare to be unhappy.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.516

Yet I think no reflecting person would give up the experience and
improvement they have gained, to have avoided the misfortunes;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.517

on the contrary, they are thankfully ranked amongst the choicest
blessings of life, when we are not under their immediate pressure.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,74.518

How earnest does a mind full of sensibility look for disinterested
friendship, <P_75> and long to meet with good unalloyed.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.519

When fortune smiles they hug the dear delusion;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.520

but dream not that it is one.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.521

The painted cloud disappears suddenly, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.522

the scene is changed, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.523

and what an aching void is left in the heart!  a void which only religion
can fill up - WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.524

and how few seek this internal comfort!  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.525

A woman, who has beauty without sentiment, is in great danger of being
seduced; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.526

and if she has any, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} guard herself from painful
mortifications.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.527

It is very disagreeable to keep up a continual reserve with men she has
been formerly familiar with; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,75.528

yet <P_76> if she places confidence, it is ten to one but she is deceived.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.529

Few men seriously think of marrying an inferior;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.530

and if they have honor enough not to take advantage of the artless
tenderness of a woman who loves, and thinks not of the difference of
rank, they do not undeceive her until she has anticipated happiness,
which, contrasted with her dependant function, appears delightful.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.531

The disappointment is severe; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.532

and the heart receives a wound which does not easily admit of a compleat
cure, as the good that is missed is not valued according to its real
worth: WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.533

for fancy drew the picture, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.534

and grief delights to create food to feed on.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,76.535

<P_77>

If what I have written should be read by parents, who are now going on
in thoughtless extravagance, and anxious only that their daughters may
be <font> genteelly educated <$$font>, let them consider to what sorrows
they expose them; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,77.537

for I have not over-coloured the picture.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,77.538

Though I warn parents to guard against leaving their daughters to
encounter so much misery; yet if a young woman falls into it, she ought
not to be discontented.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,77.539

Good must ultimately arise from every thing, to those who look beyond
this infancy of their being; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,77.540

and here the comfort of a good conscience is our only stable support.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,77.541

The main business of our lives is to <P_78> learn to be virtuous;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.542

and He who is training us up for immortal bliss, knows best what trials
will contribute to make us so; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.543

and our resignation and improvement will render us respectable to
ourselves, and to that Being, whose approbation is of more value than
life itself.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.544

It is true, tribulation produces anguish, and we would fain avoid the
bitter cup, though convinced its effects would be the most salutary.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.545

The Almighty is then the kind parent, who chastens and
educates, and indulges us not when it would tend to our hurt.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.546

He is compassion itself, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.547

and never wounds but to heal, when the ends of correction are answered.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,78.548

<P_79>

<heading>

Love.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.551

<$$heading>

I think there is not a subject that admits so little of reasoning on as
love; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.553

nor can rules be laid down that will not appear to lean too much one
way or the other.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.554

Circumstances must, in a great measure, govern the conduct in this
particular; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.555

yet who can be a judge in their own case?  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.556

Perhaps, before they begin to consider the matter, they see through the
medium of passion, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.557

and its suggestions are often mistaken for those of reason.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.558

We can no other way account for the absurd matches we every day have an
opportunity of observing; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,79.559

for in this <P_80> respect, even the most sensible men and women err.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,80.560

A variety of causes will occasion such an attachment; an endeavour to
supplant another, or being by some accident confined to the society of
one person.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,80.561

Many have found themselves entangled in an affair of honor {COM:sic},
who only meant to fill up the heavy hours in an amusing way, or raise
jealousy in some other bosom.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,80.562

It is a difficult task to write on a subject when our own passions are
likely to blind us.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,80.563

Hurried away by our feelings, we are apt to set those things down as
general maxims, which only our partial experience gives rise <P_81> to.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,81.564

Though it is not easy to say how a person should act under the immediate
influence of passion, yet they certainly have no excuse who are actuated
only by vanity, and deceive by an equivocal behaviour in order to
gratify it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,81.565

There are quite as many male coquets as female,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,81.566

and they are far more pernicious pests to society, as their sphere of
action is larger, and they are less exposed to the censure of the world.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,81.567

A smothered sigh, downcast look and the many other little arts which are
played off, may give extreme pain to a sincere, artless woman, though
she $can $not {TEXT:cannot} resent, or complain <P_82> of, the injury.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,82.568

This kind of trifling, I think, much more inexcusable than inconstancy ;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,82.569

and why it is so, appears so obvious, I need not point it out.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,82.570

People of sense and reflection are most apt to have violent and constant
passions, and to be preyed on by them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,82.571

Neither can they, for the sake of present pleasure, bear to act in such a
manner, as that the retrospect should fill them with confusion and regret.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,82.572

Perhaps a delicate mind is not susceptible of a greater degree of
misery , putting guilt out of the questions, than what must arise from
the consciousness <P_83> of loving a person whom their reason does
not approve.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,83.573

This, I am persuaded, has often been the case;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,83.574

and the passion must either be rooted out, or the continual allowances
and excuses that are made will hurt the mind, and lessen the respect
for virtue.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,83.575

Love, unsupported by esteem, must soon expire, or lead to depravity; as,
on the contrary, when a worthy person is the object, it is the greatest
incentive to improvement, and has the best effect on the manners and
temper.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,83.576

We should always try to fix in our minds the rational grounds we have
for loving a person, that we may be able to recollect them when we feel
disgust or resentment; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,83.577

<P_84>

we should then habitually practise forbearance,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.579

and the many petty disputes which interrupt domestic peace would be
avoided.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.580

A woman $can $not {TEXT:cannot} reasonably be unhappy, if she is attached
to a man of sense and goodness, though he may not be all she could wish.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.581

I am very far from thinking love irresistible, and not to be conquered.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.582

"If weak women go astray,"it is they, and not the stars, that are to
be blamed.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.583

A resolute endeavour will almost always overcome difficulties.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.584

I knew a woman very early in life warmly attached to an agreeable man,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,84.585

<P_85>

yet she saw his faults; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,85.587

his principles were unfixed, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,85.588

and his prodigal turn would have obliged her to have restrained every
benevolent emotion of her heart.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,85.589

She exerted her influence to improve him, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,85.590

but in vain did she for years try to do it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,85.591

Convinced of the impossibility, she determined not to marry him,
though she was forced to encounter poverty and its attendants.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,85.592

It is too universal a maxim with novelists, that love is felt but once;
though it appears to me, that the heart which is capable of receiving
an impression at all, and can distinguish, will turn to a new object
when the first is <P_86> found unworthy.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.593

I am convinced it is practicable, when a respect for goodness has the
first place in the mind, and notions of perfection are not affixed
to constancy.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.594

Many ladies are delicately miserable, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.595

and imagine that they are lamenting the loss of a lover, when they are
full of self-applause, and reflection on their own superior refinement.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.596

Painful feelings are prolonged beyond their natural course, to gratify
our desire of appearing heroines, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.597

and we deceive ourselves as well as others.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.598

When any sudden stroke of fate deprives us of those we love, we may not
readily get the better of the blow; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,86.599

but when we find we have <P_87> been led astray by our passions,
and that it was our own imaginations which gave the high colouring to
the picture, we may be certain time will drive it out of our minds.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.600

For we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} often think of our folly without being
displeased with ourselves, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.601

and such reflections are quickly banished.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.602

Habit and duty will co-operate, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.603

and religion may overcome what reason has in vain combated with;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.604

but refinement and romance are often confounded,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.605

and sensibility, which occasions this kind of inconstancy, is supposed
to have the contrary effect.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,87.606

<P_88>

Nothing can more tend to destroy peace of mind, than platonic attachments.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.608

They are begun in false refinement, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.609

and frequently end in sorrow, if not in guilt.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.610

The two extremes often meet, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.611

and virtue carried to excess will sometimes lead to the opposite vice.
Not that I mean to insinuate that there is no such thing as friendship
between person of different sexes; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.612

I am convinced of the contrary.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.613

I only mean to observe, that if a woman's heart is disengaged, she should
not give way to a pleasing delusion, and imagine she will be satisfied
with the friendship of a man she admires, and prefers to the rest of
the world.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,88.614

<P_89>

The heart is very treacherous, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.616

and if we do not guard its first emotions, we shall not afterwards be able
to prevent its sighing for impossibilities.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.617

If there are any insuperable bars to an union in the common way, try to
dismiss the dangerous tenderness, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.618

or it will undermine your comfort, and betray you into many errors.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.619

To attempt to raise ourselves above human beings is ridiculous;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.620

we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} extirpate our passions,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.621

nor is it necessary that we should, though it may be wise sometimes not
to stray too near a precipice, lest we fall over before we are aware.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.622

We $can $not {TEXT:cannot} avoid much vexation and sorrow, if we are
ever so prudent; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,89.623

it is then <P_90> the part of wisdom to enjoy those gleams of
sunshine which do not endanger our innocence, or lead to repentance.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.624

Love gilds all the prospects of life, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.625

and though it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} always exclude apathy it makes
many cares appear trifling.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.626

Dean Swift hated the world, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.627

and only loved particular persons; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.628

yet pride rivalled them.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.629

A foolish wish of rising superior to the common wants and desires
of the human species made him singular, but not respectable.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.630

He sacrificed an amiable woman to his caprice,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,90.631

and made those shun his company who would have been entertained and
improved by his conversation, had he loved any <P_91> one as well
as himself.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,91.632

Universal benevolence is the first duty, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,91.633

and we should be careful not to let any passion so engross our thoughts,
as to prevent our practising it.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,91.634

After all the dreams of rapture, earthly pleasures will not fill the
mind, or support it when they have not the sanction of reason, or are
too much depended on.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,91.635

The tumult of passion will subside, and even the pangs of disappointment
cease to be felt.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,91.636

But for the wicked there is a worm that never dies - a guilty conscience.
While that calm satisfaction which resignation produces, which $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be described, <P_92> but may be attained, in some degree,
by those who try to keep in the strait, though thorny path which leads to
bliss, shall sanctify the sorrows, and dignify the character of virtue.

Matrimony.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.640

Early marriages are, in my opinion, a stop to improvement.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.642

If we were born only"to draw nutrition, propagate and rot, "the sooner
the end of creation was answered the better; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.643

but as women are here allowed to have souls, the soul ought to be
attended to.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.644

In youth a woman endeavours to please the other sex, in order, generally
speaking, to get married, WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.645

and this endeavour calls forth all her powers.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.646

If she has had a tolerable education, the foundation only is laid,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.647

for the mind does not soon arrive at maturity,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,93.648

and should not be engrossed <P_94> by domestic cares before any habits
are fixed.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,94.649

The passions also have too much influence over the judgment to suffer it
to direct her in this most important affair; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,94.650

and many women, I am persuaded, marry a man before they are twenty, whom
they would have rejected some years after.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,94.651

Very frequently, when the education has been neglected, the mind improves
itself, if it has leisure for reflection, and experience to reflect on;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,94.652

but how can this happen when they are forced to act before they
have had time to think, or find that they are unhappily married?
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,94.653

Nay, should they be so fortunate as to get a good husband, they <P_95>
will not set a proper value on him; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,95.654

he will be found much inferior to the lovers described in novels,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,95.655

and their want of knowledge makes them frequently disgusted with the man,
when the fault is in human nature.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,95.656

When a woman's mind has gained some strength, she will in all probability
pay more attention to her actions than a girl can be expected to do;
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,95.657

and if she thinks seriously, she will chuse for a companion a man of
principle; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,95.658

and this perhaps young people do not sufficiently attend to, or see the
necessity of doing.  WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,95.659

A woman of feeling must be very much hurt if she <P_96> is obliged to
keep her children out of their father's company, that their morals may
not be injured by his conversation; WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,96.660

and besides, the whole arduous task of education devolves on her,
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,96.661

and in such a case it is not very practicable.
WOLLSTONECRAFT-1787-2,96.662

Attention to the education of children must be irksome, when life appears
to have so many charms, and its pleasures are not found fallacious.
