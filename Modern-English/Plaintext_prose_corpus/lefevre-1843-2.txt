CHAPTER I LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.3

<$$heading>

The goal was reached, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.5

and the race was won.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.6

I bore my blushing honours thick upon me; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.7

yet I felt as serious as if I had taken a degree in Divinity, whereas
I had been only dubbed a Doctor of Physic.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.8

What made me so sad, as I gazed upon the receding shores of"Auld
Reekie? "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.9

What had produced so striking a change in my disposition?
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.10

Why had pleasure ceased to please?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.11

I had attained the object of long and arduous pursuit;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.12

possession gave me no pleasure, because pursuit was at an end.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,3.13

There were more serious causes for <P_1,4> the melancholy which beset me.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.14

I was embarking upon the wide world, upon the sea of life, without
compass to guide, or sail to waft, or ballast to steady my boat.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.15

A pulmonic complaint, aggravated by the accession of a typhus fever,
had reduced my frame to the shadow of itself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.16

The knowledge which the study, rather than the practice, of my profession
had afforded me, was just sufficient to allow me, in the nervous state
in which I was, to conjure up every unhappy idea as to the nature of
my complaint.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.17

Each pain and ache, every uncomfortable sensation which I experienced,
seemed to indicate the last stage of consumption.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.18

I was continually feeling my pulse, taking a deep inspiration to discover
whether I had any pain in my chest, attentive to every little symptom
which might tend to strengthen the opinion which I had formed of my case.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.19

I had two objects to attain, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.20

and their mutual accomplishment was necessary to my existence.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.21

I had to regain my own health, and to procure the means of so doing by
endeavouring to restore the health of - others.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.22

I was much in the same dilemma as many of my colleagues, who find that
in order to get practice they must first get a wife, but to get a wife
they must first get practice.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.23

My medical advisers positively insisted upon my wintering in a warmer
climate.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.24

All were agreed upon one point, viz. that I could not survive
another winter in Edinburgh.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.25

All were not agreed, that I could survive another winter any where else.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,4.26

<P_1,5>

What was to be done with me?  was the question.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.28

- Go to a warmer climate, was the answer.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.29

Where?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.30

To Lisbon, to Naples, to Madeira, to the South of France - all as
readily prescribed for me, as if it were only a dose of Iceland moss.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.31

All the enthusiasm of youth would only allow me to listen to such
suggestions as hopeless.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.32

I must do justice, however, to the kind friends who thus counselled me.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.33

They were sincere in their dealings, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.34

and when they advised me to attach myself as medical attendant to some
family about to migrate to a warmer climate, they gave me letters of
introduction to influential people in England, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.35

and stated the nature of my case as pathetically as I could have done
it myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.36

It was not at the commencement of my career that I found the world
ungrateful or unkind.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.37

It was necessary in my present circumstances to possess such introductory
letters as would serve as testimonials of character, and not such merely
as secure a dinner at a fortnight's notice; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.38

and I found that I had such, addressed to people residing in any
of the places which I might choose for my winter's residence.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.39

I had my diploma in my pocket and certificates from the medical officers
of the Royal Infirmary, as to the manner in which I had performed my
duty during my residence in that institution.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.40

Upon opening my pocket book I found letters to Dr. -, physician
to the British factory at Lisbon.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.41

These I put aside.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.42

I had letters to Dr. Coindet at Geneva, and to $Professor
{TEXT:Professsor} Balbi at Turin; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,5.43

<P_1,6>

this was too northern to think of for the present; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.45

but I might find them of use in the course of my travels.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.46

It is singular what effect the reperusal of these documents had upon me.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.47

The ploughman, who after a hard morning's work sits under a tree at
noon, and opens his wallet, does not feel himself more refreshed as he
proceeds with his meal, than I felt my spirits revive as I continued my
epistolary repast.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.48

I had also several letters to English merchants at Naples from my friends
in Leith.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.49

These were precious jewels, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.50

and offered the greatest temptation, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.51

but like the golden apples were only to be looked at.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.52

To have accomplished this - to have reached Naples - to have been allowed
to visit Virgil's tomb, would have almost reconciled me to my own at
this ardent period of life.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.53

I had many other letters to foreign parts, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.54

but the home service was at present of the greatest consequence,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.55

and the various introductory epistles addressed to the medical men in
London were the sheet-anchors of my hope.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.56

An introduction to the good folks in Padua or Naples could serve me but
little, unless I could find some good folks at home who would take me
in their suite.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.57

I grew dull again, as I came to the conclusion of my last letter,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.58

and putting it aside, walked up and down the deck in despair, passing from
one extreme to the other instead of avoiding both.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.59

The Castle Hill was still in view, as I gazed towards the shore,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,6.60

and a provoking wind was <P_1,7> about to tear me from the place where
I had spent so many happy months.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.61

Indeed, I was very sad.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.62

Hitherto all had been as fiction or a fairy dream; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.63

for such is the study of the profession when compared with its practice.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.64

All my wants had been supplied from sources which could not have
failed me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.65

Now I was to rely upon my own endeavours, and to supply my own wants by
my own exertions.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.66

I had, it is true, a passport in my diploma, which was addressed <font>
omnibus et singulis <$$font>, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.67

but it no where desired the authorities to aid and assist the bearer
thereof to proceed on his journey.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.68

India promised me but little pleasure, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.69

for I had not forgotten to apply for a situation in the Company's service
, when a warm climate was recommended to me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.70

It had been promised to me upon my first application,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.71

but I despised what was so easily procured.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.72

I put it in the rear-guard of Lisbon.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.73

I had indeed no very exalted idea of the pagoda tree;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.74

and although I was assured that two men would run before me to flap
away the flies, and many more such temptations were held out to me,
still willingly would I have sacrificed them all for one year more of
"Auld Reekie. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.75

Again I had sudden twinges in my chest; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.76

my hands got warm; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.77

my face became flushed from sitting in the sun.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.78

I could never reach India, I thought, in my present state!
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.79

Such were the cogitations of the first two days after I quitted Edinburgh.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.80

Nothing amused me; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,7.81

the same objects which upon my former trips had afforded me so much
pleasure, and even called forth <P_1,8> my muse, were now unlike
themselves.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.82

It is a mistake to suppose that inanimate things must be always the same
; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.83

they are just as we wish to see them; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.84

and as no one is to-day as he was yesterday, so nothing bears the same
character or wears the same appearance at all times and at all seasons.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.85

As we proceeded on our voyage, however, the sea, which to me had always
been a restorative, braced me wonderfully; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.86

my spirits revived with my increasing appetite; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.87

and when we arrived at Wapping after eight days'beating about,
my companions told me that they should hardly have recognised me;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.88

scarcely indeed could I recognise myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.89

Almost as soon as I found myself in London, and moreover, in the city ,
I felt that inward impulse, which is generated in the metropolis, of
proceeding immediately to business.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.90

I had forgotten my consumption; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.91

I had forgotten the cause of finding myself where I was, in being
myself there.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.92

Imagination gave place to calculation.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.93

I have two strings to my bow, thought I to myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.94

I have the choice of going to India, the which is certain.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.95

I have the hopes of being appointed to some family travelling to the
South to pass the winter, the which is uncertain.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.96

It was in the pursuit of certainty, however, that I found myself about
six o'clock on a fine summer's evening strolling towards Thavies Inn,
Holborn.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.97

I never hated London so much in my life.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.98

I entered the old Inn where my friends resided, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,8.99

and was informed by a dirty looking wench who opened the door, that
the young ladies were gone with their <P_1,9> mamma to take a walk in
the country.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.100

I waited long for their return; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.101

at length the whole party arrived, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.102

and the first inquiry satisfied me that my presentiment of being still
a long distance from India was correct.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.103

The salutations and greetings were not precisely of a nature to encourage
or please me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.104

How well you look!  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.105

Well we are glad to see you, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.106

but why have you left Edinburgh?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.107

I can never call you doctor, you look so young.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.108

Well, what are your plans?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.109

I was confounded at such irrelevant questions, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.110

but, overcoming the mortifications of the spirit, I proceeded to make
inquiries with regard to my Indian affairs.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.111

-"O dear, yes!  Dr. C- will put you in the way, I dare say.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.112

It is very easily done; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.113

what makes you wish to go to India? "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.114

I soon perceived that the promises and assurances, which looked so clear
upon paper, took another turn by word of mouth.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.115

Indeed my good friend had almost forgotten all about the matter,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.116

and was quite surprised that I should think so much about it, when the
certainty of my succeeding in my application, as expressed in his letter,
had been one of the chief causes of my quitting Edinburgh so early in
the season.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.117

The doctor, who was to do my business for me, was actually in attendance
upon the family at the time, so that the opportunity was favourable.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.118

He was a celebrated character, who had spent half his time and all his
fortune in chemical pursuits.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,9.119

He had not succeeded, however, in extracting sunbeams <P_1,10>
from cucumbers, nor gold from strawberry roots; though he had been
for years occupied in attempting to accomplish the latter object.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.120

I was introduced to him in full form, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.121

and when I had detailed my case to him much as a patient would have
explained the symptoms of a complaint, he replied very good naturedly,
"Oh to be sure, very easy.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.122

Call upon my nephew in Broad Street, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.123

and he will put you in the way of it immediately. "
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.124

There was no doubt of their relationship, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.125

they had been cast in the same mould, morally and physically.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.126

Dr. C- could find no gold in strawberry roots;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.127

his nephew could find no contagion in plague.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.128

His moral evidence to the contrary was so strong, that he would not
believe the evidence of his other senses, as he honestly declared before
the House of Commons.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.129

The uncle, on the contrary, fully believed that there existed gold in
strawberry roots, though his senses never assisted him in the pursuit.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.130

<font>"Arcades ambo. "<$$font> Uncle and nephew.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.131

The latter received me in his dressing-gown, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.132

and when I informed him of the nature of my visit, and delivered his
uncle's message to him, he replied that he had no interest whatever in
the India Board, but that if I got an appointment, he would examine me
previous to my departure for India, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.133

for he was examiner to the Board.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.134

He would prove to me as he had done to the House of Commons, by argument
at least, if not by noses, that neither plague nor typhus was contagious.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.135

I opened the eyes of astonishment, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.136

but my ears were closed to conviction, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,10.137

for I was in <P_1,11> my individual person a proof at least of the
contrary, having lately suffered by fever from attending upon fever
patients.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.138

He recommended me to call upon Mr. A- at the India House,
to inquire if there were a vacancy, and to show him my testimonials.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.139

I wished the doctor good morning, perfectly convinced that we should
not meet again.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.140

To conclude my India affairs.  I called the following morning on
Mr. A- at the India House; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.141

he looked at me with a frown of perfect contempt, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.142

and when I informed him that I came recommended by Dr. -, he
raised his voice to a Bombay pitch, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.143

and informed me, he could only receive applications through a director,
and that the old fool knew so perfectly well, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.144

and returning to his ledger, spared me the civility of a good morning.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.145

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that I was much disappointed.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.146

I was prepared for the result.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.147

I had more strings to my bow, and more irons in the fire,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.148

and as I could do nothing in the East, I proceeded to try my luck in
the West Indies.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.149

Among numerous letters with which I was provided, I had an introductory
one to a celebrated doctor who wore a slouch hat, and had endeavoured
to pick up a good deal of practice in the neighbourhood of Soho Square.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.150

No doubt the reader is already in Dr. Eady's portico,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.151

and I must leave him there, unless he choose to follow me;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.152

for I protest that I was never there myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.153

The gentleman I allude to was of a different stamp, although far less
famed than Dr. Eady; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,11.154

he was himself a West Indian, <P_1,12> and a native of Jamaica.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.155

As I hate presenting an introductory letter, I left it with my address ,
the servant telling me that his master would be at home the following
morning before ten o'clock.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.156

I presented myself at that hour.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.157

The doctor reminded me of a knight-errant in the Black Forest.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.158

He was tall, lank, and lean, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.159

had large whiskers, eyes sunk in their orbits, a wildish expression,
and a rough cracked voice.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.160

He was seated at his breakfast table in Dean Street, in a large
comfortless house, and in an equally comfortless parlour - a black japan
tea-board much the worse for wear, a queen's metal tea-pot, and a loaf
of stale bread before him; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.161

for it was Sunday, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.162

and no rolls are allowed to be baked on the Sabbath day.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.163

The doctor was seated at his breakfast table, I say, reading the Observer
Newspaper.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.164

Lifting his eyes from the columns, he greeted me by reading a
paragraph from the same paper upon the utility of public executions.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.165

He then quoted some Greek and Latin authors, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.166

and asked me if I did not think that private hanging would have a much
more salutary effect in repressing vice.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.167

We discussed the point at some length <paren> a singular introductory
topic <$$paren>, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.168

and both agreed that public executions had lost much of their effect
from their frequency.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.169

Soon changing the topic, however, and proceeding to private affairs ,
he addressed me upon the subject of my introductory letter to him,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.170

and promised to give me such recommendatory letters to Jamaica as would
answer all my purposes.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,12.171

<P_1,13>

There are some characters with whom I can never assimilate.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.173

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} easily overcome a certain prejudice caused by
first impressions, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.174

and the more I endeavour to do so, the less I succeed.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.175

I am an instance in myself of the atomic theory.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.176

I can only unite in definite proportions, without which there is no
combination.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.177

I could not harmonise with my West India friend; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.178

there was no affinity in our compositions, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.179

and we could never form a sympathetic friendship.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.180

I must stick to Europe, thought I to myself, as I lounged along the alleys
which lead from Gerard Street to Long Acre, after having made my bow,
and retired with the promise of calling again.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.181

These East and West India complexions are too tawny for my taste,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.182

and I felt in my pocket for some more introductory letters.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.183

It happened by chance that I took out one addressed to a Scotchman in -.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.184

Chance shall I call it?  call that <font> chance <$$font> which was the
foundation and corner-stone of all my subsequent career? "call God's
good providence a lucky hit? "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.185

I had many letters yet undelivered, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.186

and the truth is, I awaited the printing of my doctorial card, which I
was anxious to deliver with them.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.187

I will deliver this letter said I to myself; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.188

I have a certain presentiment that this may be of service,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.189

and I hurried on to the address.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.190

I was ushered into a small dirty parlour, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.191

and had hardly time to pace its dimensions when I was re-ushered into
the study.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,13.192

A thin, spare, comical looking man received me, with one eye shut, with
a cock in the other, and a twist in <P_1,14> the corner of his mouth.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.193

I never saw any thing less medical in my life in appearance;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.194

for instead of seeing a figure all in black, a uniform appropriate to
the profession, I found this inhabitant of the West End manor dressed
in a long loose coat, and a red cravat tied loosely round his neck.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.195

He was skimming over my introductory epistle, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.196

and turning to me -"Well, and so you would be for going abroad?
"LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.197

I replied in the affirmative, provided I could find some means of
franking myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.198

"$That $'s {TEXT:That's} not so easy,"he replied; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.199

"families do not take medical men with them now-a-days,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.200

for they find enough of them every where, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.201

and it is a horrid bore to be bothered with a stranger. "
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.202

There was, I thought, a particularly ugly cast in his eyes as he made
this speech.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.203

"I know a gentleman,"continued he,"who is going to Spain,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.204

but he wants no doctor. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.205

In a moment I seized the idea, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.206

and replied, I have some thoughts of going to Lisbon, where I have
friends.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.207

He made no direct reply, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.208

but I thought there was a more amiable turn in his other eye.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.209

"Where are you to be found? "he continued; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.210

I gave him the address of my West India friend.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.211

"What, is he one of your cronies, the old fool? " LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.212

and cocking both eyes, he shook me by the hand LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.213

and told me to call again in a day or two if I passed that way.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.214

I observed that he had scribbled my address on a piece of paper, which
I thought looked well.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.215

From Pall Mall East I descended a little in the aristocratic scale,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,14.216

and made my next assault upon a <P_1,15> dapper little doctor who lived
in Bloomsbury Square, to whom I had very strong recommendatory letters.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.217

He was the very antipodes of my Scotch friend; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.218

he wore powder and silk stockings, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.219

and though not very far advanced in his professional course, was , what is
styled in medical parlance, a"rising character. " LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.220

He was under the special protection of an old practitioner, who was
putting him by degrees into his shoes, which became daily more easy to
their new wearer.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.221

He was still upon his legs, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.222

and had not even launched his <font> voiture expectante <$$font>,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.223

yet the profession looked upon him as a rising man.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.224

He was established on the neutral ground, or half way between the city
and the west-end; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.225

and there is a very sensible medical line of demarcation.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.226

All is city from Bedford Row eastward.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.227

The neutral ground lies between Bedford Row, which it includes,
together with the squares to the right, as far down as Charing Cross.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.228

All the rest is west.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.229

North and south were not marked in the medical chart at that time.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.230

Now the neutral ground is very thick set with doctors.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.231

It is aspiring ground, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.232

and the public judge much of a man's talents by the way in which he
seems to thrive himself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.233

The city is decidedly plebeian, the neutral ground aspiring, the west-end
aristocratic.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.234

When young physicians commence in the city, they take a lodging in
Fenchurch Street, where they generally reside two years upon their
private means, if they have the means of residing there so long.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.235

They take no fee during this period, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,15.236

but talk very much of their practice increasing, as soon as they
<P_1,16> have taken one, which is about the beginning of the third year.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.237

They talk of having doubled their practice the fourth year, which means
that they have taken two fees, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.238

and they change their lodgings LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.239

and remove to Bucklersbury.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.240

Here they remain stationary for some time, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.241

and if they do not succeed, put their diplomas into their pockets,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.242

and go into the country to practice as apothecaries.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.243

If they succeed, however, and get enough to pay their washerwomen,
they take part of a house in Broad Street, from whence they remove to
the neutral ground and become rising men.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.244

To return, however, to little Dr. -, who occupied the middle space,
or was an aspiring character.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.245

I found him also, at breakfast, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.246

and he was very jocular, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.247

had retained a great many of his patron's anecdotes,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.248

and invented a few of his own.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.249

I found his jokes less stale than his eggs; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.250

but who can procure a fresh egg in London?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.251

After dispatching both, however, he told me he would do all in his power
to further my wishes, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.252

and begged me to call upon him the following day, as he had something
in view.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.253

This was very pleasant to my feelings, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.254

and I could not help drawing a comparison between the characters of the
men to whom I had already applied, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.255

and it was certainly in his favour.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.256

Upon revisiting him - I should perhaps say, redunning him - he asked
me if it were worth my while to go to Nice with the Dowager Lady E-.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.257

I replied, I thought it would be a very <font> nice <$$font> trip, and was
what I particularly thought would suit my case.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,16.258

<P_1,17>

He gave me his card, with a note addressed to a fashionable apothecary
in L- C- Street, who would converse with me upon the subject.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.260

God be praised!  said I to myself, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.261

this is coming to the point.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.262

The others have <font> promised <$$font> me a great deal,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.263

but this man <font> performs.  <$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.264

I was prepossessed in his favour at first sight.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.265

As I hurried along to deliver the card and the address, I halted
for a moment as I suddenly recollected that I had forgotten a very
important part, viz. the sum I should ask for my services.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.266

I retraced my steps a few paces, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.267

and after due consideration, decided modestly upon a thousand pounds.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.268

I am but young, I thought, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.269

and it will be an introduction.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.270

There are disagreeables in all professions, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.271

for I smelt the shop as I entered it.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.272

The Galen himself was writing in his ledger when I delivered him the
card and letter.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.273

He looked upon me with contempt, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.274

and told me the situation was not vacant.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.275

Lady - was already half way to Nice; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.276

and without taking off his hat, or wishing me good morning, continued
to write in his book.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.277

At first, I thought my friend the doctor had really played me a trick,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.278

but knowing that to be impossible, I vented all my rage upon the
apothecary.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.279

I had delivered letters to three physicians, and to a first rate west-end
{COM:sic_lowercase} surgeon, all of whom had received me most politely ;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.280

and was I to be treated thus cavalierly by an apothecary in L- C- Street;
I who was a doctor, too?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.281

I felt no inclination to proceed further in this direction,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,17.282

but it occurred to me as I passed by his <P_1,18> door, that I had not
seen my old teacher.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.283

I determined, therefore, to call upon him, and state my views to him.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.284

A few more letters, I thought, would do me no harm;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.285

they were at all events equivalent to certificates of good conduct.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.286

He received me with his usual kindness, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.287

and.  forgetting, as he always did, my name, asked me from whence I
came last.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.288

I am just returned from Edinburgh.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.289

"Oh, true,"he replied; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.290

"I hear that you took an active part in the debates of the Medical
Society, and supported the doctrines of the Borough school.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.291

What are the prevailing doctrines now in Edinburgh?
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.292

I remember, that when I was there, I found very few who were
thoroughly acquainted with John Hunter, although he was a Scotchman.
"LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.293

He is my Magnus Apollo, I exclaimed LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.294

and was continuing my -, when Charles the servant opened the door for
a third time <paren> a hint to patients who bother the doctor too long
about their complaints <$$paren>.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.295

"Stop,"said he, as I was retreating, abashed by the proceedings of the
footman: LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.296

"You are not a patient.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.297

What are your plans? "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.298

I detailed them as concisely as possible, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.299

and as concisely did he scribble me four letters to his medical
friends, begging them, if in their power, to further my views.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.300

"God bless you,"he said, shaking my hand, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.301

"if these $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} do, come again.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.302

Charles, show the next gentleman up stairs;"LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.303

and I went down, without being"shown"down.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.304

It was not till a week afterwards that I could deliver the letters in
<font> propria` persona`.  <$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,18.305

This was accomplished, <P_1,19> however, upon my return to town;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.306

but it was necessary that I should explain the object of my
application to each individually, to whom these letters were addressed.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.307

This was not so easy a matter as it would have been previously;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.308

for my health was now much restored, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.309

and I began to grow stout again, so that when I talked of health
and consumption, I only excited the smiles of the conscript fathers.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.310

There was one exception to this, however: LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.311

Dr. Warren told me,"Yours is a case for a warm climate;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.312

that membrane is weak; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.313

when you are older it will be stronger. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.314

If I do not die first, thought I to myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.315

His opinion has been fully realised, however, unless the certainty of
not being consumptive at present comes under the nosological definition -
"delusive hopes of recovery. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.316

All, however, were excessively polite to me, which made me more venomous
still against the apothecary.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.317

In waiting the result of all these applications, I began to be afraid
that I was like the hare, with many friends.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.318

I received a letter one morning from my West Indian acquaintance,
inviting me to join him at the Italian Opera.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.319

I did so, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.320

for I was glad of the opportunity; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.321

I had never been there before.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.322

I was most grievously disappointed.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.323

It was between the acts of Il flauto Magico that the doctor turned round
to me, and asked me if I would undertake his practice for a fortnight.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.324

He wished to go to Seven Oaks, where many of his patients resided,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,19.325

and if I would attend his dispensary, and visit the few patients
<P_1,20> who remained in town, he would gladly leave them under my care.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.326

In a few days I was installed in the Doctor's chair,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.327

and was myself become a doctor <font> de facto.  <$$font>
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.328

It required more tact to manage the dispensary pupils than the dispensary
patients.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.329

I found some of these said pupils my seniors in more than age, and
very inquisitive.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.330

A good face upon difficulties, and carry all with a high hand:
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.331

I was an advocate for decided practice, as it is styled - a decided
practitioner; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.332

and there is no more certain way of imposing upon people, than by
impressing upon them this idea - LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.333

say that a man is a decided practitioner, it is enough.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.334

Nobody will inquire in what sense - <font> bad <$$font> or good - this
word"decided"is to be taken.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.335

I bled, purged, and blistered decidedly, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.336

and the cases being of an inflammatory character, as upon Gil Blas's
debu`t, it happened to be decidedly <font> good <$$font> practice.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.337

I never shall forget the joy which I felt when I fingered the first
guinea.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.338

It was a genuine coin, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.339

for it was at this time, and a most memorable period it was, that I took
my maiden fee.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.340

The old <font> unreformed guinea <$$font>, none of your sovereigns wrapped
up with a shilling, as you see them now-a-days.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.341

It was pure and without alloy, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.342

and often did I finger it over in my pocket, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.343

and sighing involuntarily, said to myself, How many more shall I receive
in the career which is now opening to me?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.344

A conscientious hectic flushed across my face; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.345

it was the first and last time that I ever felt embarrassed at receiving
a fee.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,20.346

I was in a <P_1,21> few days afterwards presented with a second one;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.347

it came quite as a thing of course.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.348

I thought it tardy in its arrival.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.349

These are the only two fees which I took at that period in London.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.350

In awaiting a third, I was summoned to the surgeon who had not inquired
after me since my first application to him, so that I despaired of
success in that quarter.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.351

"Well,"says he,"have you found any thing to suit you? "
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.352

I replied in the negative.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.353

"You wish to go to Lisbon? "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.354

Provided I can find nothing better, I shall pass the winter with my uncle,
who resides there, I replied.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.355

"The gentleman I spoke to you about, the other day, is going to Spain ;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.356

and though he is not anxious to take a medical man with him, yet I think
you might contrive to go together.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.357

Call upon me, on Sunday, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.358

and we will talk again upon the matter.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.359

I shall see Lord - in the mean time. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.360

Lord!  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.361

how the sound of"lord"resounded in my ears - physician to a lord!
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.362

In a few days all was arranged, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.363

and I was to be introduced to his lordship as travelling physician,
previous to our departure for the continent.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.364

Lord, physician, and continent were three words which I could not
have supposed to bear any relation to each other as regarded myself.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.365

I had still a fortnight before me, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.366

for his lordship had migrated into the country; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,21.367

and as I was not to see him till his return, I thought I could not do
better than take a few finishing lessons in the French language, knowing
just as much as boys do when they leave school, <P_1,22> where they had
a French master once a week.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,22.368

It happened that M. Racine, professor of the language, lived in
the same street as myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,22.369

The worthy professor told me, honestly, that as my stay would be so
short in England, he could not do me any service, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,22.370

and declined the undertaking.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,22.371

Should I have acted as honestly, had M. Racine applied to me for a
fortnight's doctoring for some chronic complaint?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,22.372

<P_1,23>

<heading>

CHAP. II.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.375

<$$heading>

In the month of September, 1819, I was introduced to his lordship,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.377

and I shall never forget the impression that my patient made upon me.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.378

I saw all the features of consumption traced upon his face,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.379

and I must have expressed this by my own <paren> one of the most
treacherous ever allotted to man <$$paren>, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.380

for as soon as we left the room, the surgeon said to me,"I see you think
it is all over with him.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.381

You are right, I am afraid; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.382

but still he may live some time. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,23.383

If I had none of those bashful fearful feelings, which some anticipate in
their first introduction to those of a superior rank, still I had very
different <P_1,24> sentiments after this interview from those which I
had previously entertained.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.384

I found his lordship mild and condescending, affable in his manners,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.385

and he wore an agreeable smile upon his face which was at the same time
captivating and dignified.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.386

I thought that I could trace even in the lengthened mien and haggard
appearance no ordinary marks of intellect.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.387

There was something, however, restless about him; an agitation of mind
, evinced by his bodily movements; and a certain decision in his tone,
which, perhaps, bordered upon obstinacy.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.388

His was a mind which evidently could not remain a moment unoccupied.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.389

There was no approach to a state of rest.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.390

Such was my first impression, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.391

and it was a true one.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.392

This was the feature in the composition which alone brought us into
contact, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.393

for the feverish brain had destroyed the outward man,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.394

and was now gnawing the vitals.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.395

It was arranged that I should leave the party in London, and proceed
<font> solus <$$font> to Dover, where they would join me the following
day.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.396

I got to Dover, and into the heart of the town, without perceiving it; so
dense was the fog at six o'clock in the morning in the month of September.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.397

I went to bed; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.398

it was Sunday morning; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.399

and when I had refreshed myself with a little broken sleep, and with a
good breakfast, I began to reflect upon the nature of things in general,
and my own affairs in particular.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.400

My first idea was naturally to commence my journal.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.401

I began by philosophising upon my present situation.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.402

It was certainly a new one to me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,24.403

I was placed in circumstances, which I could hardly, in the probability
of <P_1,25> events, ever have anticipated.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.404

When I began seriously to reflect, therefore, how I came to be so,
it produced a mental excitement, which those only can understand,
who, like myself, have suddenly passed into such opposite states;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.405

nor can even they appreciate it, unless, at the same age, they have
possessed the same enthusiasm as myself.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.406

I had lately recovered from an alarming illness, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.407

and my nerves still vibrated under its effects.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.408

I had quitted Edinburgh under disadvantageous circumstances, having
been obliged to resign an official situation in the Infirmary, which,
at that period of my medical career, promised to be most conducive to
my success.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.409

Upon quitting Scotland, I knew not whither I was going, nor what
means I should find to carry into effect, what was then indeed
the one thing needful; viz. the restoration of my health.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.410

My funds were not ample, hardly sufficient indeed to take me to
Lisbon, could I find no other port, where I might drop my anchor.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.411

I was far from being destitute, it is true, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.412

but my pride would not allow me to apply to friends for pecuniary
assistance.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.413

I had received letters from my father, who was in France, authorising
me to draw upon him for a hundred pounds; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.414

but the last time that we parted, we had an altercation upon that subject,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.415

and I had almost resolved never to apply again to that source.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.416

It was an impious resolution, begotten in pride, and reared in
ingratitude.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.417

Such were my feelings, two months previous, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.418

and they were wrought to excess by the little power my fever left me to
resist them.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,25.419

How differently did <P_1,26> I find myself situated at the present moment.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.420

I was at once turning my professional studies to account, and putting into
my pocket what I had been putting into my head.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.421

I was about to work out my temporal subsistence; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.422

and how easy, how amiable did the task appear!  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.423

The same excess of feeling, which once depressed me beyond what
was absolutely probable, now raised me above all possibility;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.424

for no one ever so little reduced to practice the golden rule of Horace -
<font>"Aequam servare mentem. "<$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.425

I imagined myself, therefore, at once launched into fashionable life,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.426

and was travelling physician to an English nobleman, about to set out
upon his travels.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.427

How sweetly smooth did the future appear to me; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.428

my success I considered certain.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.429

I had the first interest, which would protect and patronise me in future.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.430

I imagined myself already practising in St. James's, my carriage
waiting at the door, until I had dismissed my morning patients.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.431

These, and similarly extravagant misconceptions of my real situation,
worked upon my imagination, always prone to look forward to a brilliant
future - always paying the price of its ardour in the disappointment of
the present.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.432

How different did the thing really appear, when placed in its true
colours.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.433

- What was I, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.434

and what was I about to do?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,26.435

A youth, who with some hundred more of his companions, had got a
medical diploma, and, by a lucky concatenation of events, was allowed to
accompany a family to the South of France, who might repay themselves
for the inconveniences such a guest might cause them <P_1,27> by some
trifling services which he might render them!  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.436

The family did not send for me till the following day, when I was summoned
to attend them.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.437

I was rather mortified, when I heard that they had arrived the previous
evening, without immediately sending for me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.438

Why should his Lordship miss an opportunity of availing himself of
my services?  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.439

It appeared to me rather <font> infra dig.  <$$font>
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.440

Nay, two or three other circumstances piqued me a little,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.441

and I determined to keep up the dignity of my cloth.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.442

Time and experience put all things to rights.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.443

We embarked the same day, in a small craft.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.444

The wind blew fresh, and almost in our teeth, so that we were seven
hours in crossing; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.445

and physician, as well as patient, suffered cruelly from sea-sickness.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.446

As it was dark before we got into the harbour, I was only aware of it by
the instantaneous cessation of uneasy symptoms.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.447

Never do I recollect such a transition from pain to pleasure,
as I experienced, when the vessel doubled the platform at Calais.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.448

I was upon French ground, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.449

and all was new to me, but not so new as I had anticipated.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.450

We went to Dessin's LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.451

and had a French dinner of odds and ends.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.452

Not a leg of beef upon the table, as the invalid Mathews observes,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.453

and"You see your dinner, Sir. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.454

There was a <font> ne plus ultra <$$font> of all dainties, <font> an
omelette aux comfitures {COM:sic}.  <$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.455

Were I asked, what in life had made the most indelible impression upon
my senses, I should reply without hesitation, <font> An omelette aux
comfitures!  <$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.456

I commenced practice this evening, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,27.457

and prescribed <P_1,28> a composing draught for his Lordship, which,
perhaps, was never taken.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.458

The following morning we started for Paris.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.459

Two carriages were waiting in the yard, with the horses, ready.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.460

"You will take charge of the calash,"said his Lordship, pointing it out to
me, as he and her Ladyship mounted the chariot.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.461

Dignity of the cloth, I replied, mentally, as I found myself seated by
the <font> femme de chambre.  <$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.462

I was sulky during half of the first stage; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.463

I grew better towards dinner time, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.464

and in the evening was as happy as ever I remember to have been.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.465

We proceeded by slow journies, seldom starting before eleven, nor
travelling after dinner, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.466

for my patient was in too weak a state to allow of forced marches.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.467

This gave me an opportunity of seeing every thing to advantage.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.468

The every thing was in reality nothing, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.469

but I did not believe so then.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.470

On the sixth day we arrived at Paris; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.471

and I had been requested, before I left England, to consult with
Dr. M-, upon his Lordship's case.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.472

I never shall forget the first consultation.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.473

Being the junior physician, I had to write the prescription.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.474

I thought it would never end: LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.475

it occupied one side of a sheet of foolscap.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.476

It reminded me of Dr. Paris's apothecary, who shot out
all the arrows which he could, in hopes that some might hit.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.477

Lady - took it up LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.478

and laughed, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.479

"What is all this to do? "she asked me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.480

"To do his Lordship good, my Lady. "LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.481

The prescription was made up, and the physician fee'd.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.482

I found this consultation a much less formidable thing than I had
imagined.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,28.483

We were both agreed as to the nature of <P_1,29> the case, which I
thought did me credit at the time - a case of galloping consumption!
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.484

It was rather disinterested, on my part, that I should have endeavoured to
abridge, rather than prolong, our stay in Paris; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.485

but the season was advancing, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.486

and it was on the sixth day after we arrived that we found ourselves
again upon the wing.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.487

Quitting the city by the barrier of the Invalids, we halted at Estampes
for the night.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.488

$'T $was {TEXT:'Twas} a cold, dreary evening, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.489

and we were not very comfortably lodged.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.490

The frequent coughing of my patient, who slept in an adjoining room,
discomposed me very much, so that I rose, and rapping at his door,
gained admittance.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.491

Her Ladyship smiled at my alarm, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.492

and assured me it was nothing at all, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.493

for such fits were very frequent.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.494

I persuaded her to get him to take a little poppy syrup, which seemed
to soothe him for the rest of the night.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.495

We reached Orleans the following evening; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.496

and its fine cathedral, though unfinished, as most of those
continental edifices are, excited all my architectural admiration.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.497

I know not how it is, that these sanctuaries, so many of them remain
unfinished; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.498

but I hardly recollect having seen one, either in France or Germany,
which can be called complete.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.499

Raised to the honour of the Supreme Being, the means should have
been found of completing the offering; whereas, it would seem that
the curse of Babel was upon them for their presumptuous destination.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.500

The monument of Joan of Arc, the celebrated maid of Orlanes, stands in
the market-place, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,29.501

and has received <P_1,30> the last touch of the artist; whereas, the
temple of God still remains but half achieved.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.502

We passed along the banks of the Loire, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.503

and arrived at Tours on the fifth day, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.504

and made it a halting place.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.505

I was anxious to apply some leeches to my patient, a practice which had
been continued at certain intervals for a long period of his complaint;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.506

and I wished him to remain quiet for a day or two afterwards.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.507

I met with an adventure here, which redounds to the honesty or ignorance
of the inhabitants.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.508

We lodged in the suburbs of this pretty town, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.509

and his Lordship requested me to take a draft to the banker's for a
hundred pounds, endorsed by himself, and rolled up in one of Hammersley's
letters.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.510

I put them in my coat pocket, taking the courier with me to bring the
cash home.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.511

I proceeded over the long handsome bridge of Tours to the banker's,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.512

and delivered the letter, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.513

but upon asking for the money, I was requested to produce the draft.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.514

I pointed to the letter which I had just handed over.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.515

This, however, they informed me was no demand for money, unless
accompanied by a bill, endorsed by his Lordship.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.516

I flattered myself that some mistake must have occurred, and
that his Lordship had forgotten to give me the real document,
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.517

and I repaced my steps hastily to the inn.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.518

I found, to my dismay, that the bill had been rolled up in
Hammersley's letter, and that I must have pulled it out of my pocket.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.519

Judge, therefore, of my confusion at finding myself in this predicament.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.520

I was quite distracted, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,30.521

nor could I be consoled by <P_1,31> the kind manner in which the parties
treated it, assuring me that it was not the first hundred pounds which
had been lost.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.522

I retraced my steps, trembling with agitation as I passed along, looking
into every hole and corner of the street.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.523

I had some faint recollection of having pulled out my handkerchief at
the corner of the bridge.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.524

To this point I hurried, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.525

and seeing an old apple-woman seated at her stall, I addressed myself
to her.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.526

I inquired if she had seen any thing fall out of my pocket about an hour
before, as I passed over the bridge, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.527

for I recollected to have seen her there; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.528

she replied in the negative.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.529

My hopes vanished - LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.530

they were founded upon the old apple-woman.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.531

I continued my search, however, in the nooks formed by each abutment of
the bridge, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.532

and when about half the way over, my ears were saluted by the voice of a
little urchin, who, running up to me, told me his mamma wished to speak
to me.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.533

Every thing is a reprieve to a mind which is in a state of doubt and
uncertainty.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.534

The boy's voice was like that of a cherub to me: LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.535

hope is never long absent from the human breast.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.536

I listened to him LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.537

and followed him to his mother.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.538

I could make nothing out of her talk which was likely to encourage me.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.539

It ran much thus: LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.540

her lad had seen another lad, whose mother had seen a walnut woman,
whose lad had picked up a piece of paper in some part of the town, and
given it to his mother, who had taken it home, not knowing what it was.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,31.541

Notwithstanding this <font> embrouillement <$$font>, after an hour or
two's diplomatic inquiry, conducted by the courier, to whom I promised
<P_1,32> a handsome reward, we came to the house in a distant part of
the city, where we found several women employed in cracking walnuts;
the oil of this fruit being a considerable branch of commerce in this
part of France.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.542

As soon as we entered the room, the woman who had found the draft arose
from her seat, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.543

and, saluting us, exclaimed, <font>"Je devine, Messieurs, ce que vous
venez chercher; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.544

il n'est plus ici. "<$$font> LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.545

She then entered into a long detail, how she came by it, and what she
had done with it.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.546

A council of war had been held in her quarter, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.547

and it was decided, as the safest plan, to take the paper to the
banker, where she had deposited it, and whither she accompanied me.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.548

We found all in order; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.549

and, rewarding her with a Louis, I returned to the inn in ecstasy.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.550

My first impression was, that it was a proof of national honesty;
my second, that the woman was not aware of the value of the prize,
nor how to turn it to account.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.551

The first impression was a kind of instinctive idea;
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.552

the second was engendered by reading Tom Jones; LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.553

and I concluded the woman to be in much the same situation as the old
beggar, who, when he found out the value of the notes, which he so
honestly gave up, cursed his father for not having given him an early
education, and taught him at least to read.  LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.554

Truth lies at the bottom of a well, LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.555

and lucky is he who discovers it after a long and laborious search.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.556

On leaving Tours, we quitted the banks of the Loire, which the
great beauty of the weather had rendered doubly interesting.
LEFEVRE-1843-2,1,32.557
