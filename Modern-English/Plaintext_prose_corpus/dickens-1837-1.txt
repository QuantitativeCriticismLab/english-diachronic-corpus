Chapter 40 DICKENS-1837-1,544.3

<font> What befel Mr Pickwick when he got into the Fleet; what Debtors
he saw there; and how he passed the Night <$$font> DICKENS-1837-1,544.4

<$$heading>

Mr Tom Roker, the gentleman who had accompanied Mr Pickwick into the
prison, turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of
the little flight of steps, DICKENS-1837-1,544.6

and led the way through an iron gate which stood open, and up another
short flight of steps, into a long narrow gallery, dirty and low, paved
with stone, and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end.
DICKENS-1837-1,544.7

'This,'said the gentleman, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and
looking carelessly over his shoulder to Mr Pickwick,'This here is the
hall flight. 'DICKENS-1837-1,544.8

'Oh,'replied Mr Pickwick, looking down a dark and filthy staircase, which
appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults beneath the
ground, DICKENS-1837-1,544.9

'and those, I suppose, are the little cellars where the prisoners keep
their small quantities of coals.  DICKENS-1837-1,544.10

Ah!  unpleasant places to have to go down to; but very convenient,
I dare say. 'DICKENS-1837-1,544.11

'Yes, I $should $n't {TEXT:shouldn't} wonder if they was convenient,
'replied the gentleman,'seeing that a few people live there pretty snug.
DICKENS-1837-1,544.12

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} the Fair, that is. 'DICKENS-1837-1,544.13

'My friend,'said Mr Pickwick,'you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} really
mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons?
'DICKENS-1837-1,544.14

'$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} I? 'replied Mr Roker, with indignant astonishment;
DICKENS-1837-1,544.15

'why $should $n't {TEXT:shouldn't} I? 'DICKENS-1837-1,544.16

<P_545>

'Live!  - live down there! 'exclaimed Mr Pickwick. 'Live down there!
DICKENS-1837-1,545.18

yes, and die down there, too, wery often! 'replied Mr Roker;
DICKENS-1837-1,545.19

'and what of that?  DICKENS-1837-1,545.20

$Who $'s {TEXT:Who's} got to say anything agin it?  DICKENS-1837-1,545.21

Live down there!  DICKENS-1837-1,545.22

- yes, and a wery good place it is to live in, $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't}
it? 'DICKENS-1837-1,545.23

As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr Pickwick in saying this, and
moreover muttered, in an excited fashion, certain unpleasant invocations
concerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating fluids, the latter
gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further.
DICKENS-1837-1,545.24

Mr Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase, as dirty as that
which led to the place which had just been the subject of discussion
, in which ascent he was closely followed by Mr Pickwick and Sam.
DICKENS-1837-1,545.25

'There,'said Mr Roker, pausing for breath when they reached another
gallery of the same dimensions as the one below,'this is the coffee-room
flight: DICKENS-1837-1,545.26

the one $above $'s {TEXT:above's} the third, DICKENS-1837-1,545.27

and the one above $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the top; DICKENS-1837-1,545.28

and the room where $you $'re {TEXT:you're} a going to sleep to-night is
the warden's room, DICKENS-1837-1,545.29

and $it $'s {TEXT:it's} this way - DICKENS-1837-1,545.30

come on. 'DICKENS-1837-1,545.31

Having said all this in a breath, Mr Roker mounted another flight
of stairs, with Mr Pickwick and Sam Weller following at his heels.
DICKENS-1837-1,545.32

These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little
distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a
high brick wall, with iron <font> chevaux-de-frise <$$font> at the top.
DICKENS-1837-1,545.33

This area, it appeared from Mr Roker's statement, was the racket-ground
; DICKENS-1837-1,545.34

and it further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman,
that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was
nearest Farringdon-street, denominated and called'the Painted Ground,
'from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblances of
various men-of-war in full sail, and other artistical effects, achieved
in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.
DICKENS-1837-1,545.35

Having communicated this piece of information, apparently more for the
purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact, than with any
specific view of enlightening Mr Pickwick, the guide, having at length
reached another gallery, led the way into a small passage at the extreme
end; DICKENS-1837-1,545.36

opened a door, DICKENS-1837-1,545.37

and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting,
containing eight or nine iron bedsteads.  DICKENS-1837-1,545.38

'There,'said Mr Roker, holding the door open, and looking triumphantly
round at Mr Pickwick, DICKENS-1837-1,545.39

'$There $'s {TEXT:There's} a room! 'DICKENS-1837-1,545.40

Mr Pickwick's face, however, betokened such a very trifling portion of
satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr Roker looked for
a reciprocity of feeling into the countenance of Samuel Weller, who,
until now, had observed a dignified silence.  DICKENS-1837-1,545.41

<P_546>

'$There $'s {TEXT:There's} a room, young man,'observed Mr Roker.
DICKENS-1837-1,546.43

'I see it,'replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.
DICKENS-1837-1,546.44

'You $would $n't {TEXT:wouldn't} think to find such a room as this, in
the Farringdon Hotel, would you? 'said Mr Roker, with a complacent smile.
DICKENS-1837-1,546.45

To this Mr Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye
; which might be considered to mean, either that he would have thought
it, or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never thought
anything at all about it, just as the observer's imagination suggested.
DICKENS-1837-1,546.46

Having executed this feat, and re-opened his eye, Mr Weller
proceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that Mr
Roker had so flatteringly described as an out-and-outer to sleep in.
DICKENS-1837-1,546.47

'$That $'s {TEXT:That's} it,'replied Mr Roker, pointing to a very rusty
one in a corner.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.48

'It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would, whether they
wanted to or not. 'DICKENS-1837-1,546.49

'I should think,'said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in question
with a look of excessive disgust,'I should think poppies was nothin'
to it. 'DICKENS-1837-1,546.50

'Nothing at all,'said Mr Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.51

'And I s'pose,'said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master, as if to
see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken
by what passed,'I s'pose the other gen'l'men as sleeps here, <font>
are <$$font> gen'l'men. 'DICKENS-1837-1,546.52

'Nothing but it,'said Mr Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.53

'One of'em takes his twelve pints of ale a-day, DICKENS-1837-1,546.54

and never leaves off smoking, even at his meals. ' DICKENS-1837-1,546.55

'He must be a first-rater,'said Sam.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.56

'A, 1,'replied Mr Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.57

Nothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr Pickwick smilingly
announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead
for that night; DICKENS-1837-1,546.58

and Mr Roker, after informing him that he could retire to rest at whatever
hour he thought proper without any further notice or formality, walked
off, leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.59

It was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in
this place, which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening,
which had set in outside.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.60

As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms
which opened into the gallery on either hand, had set their doors ajar.
DICKENS-1837-1,546.61

Mr Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along, with great curiosity
and interest.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.62

Here, four or five great hulking fellows, just visible through a cloud
of tobacco-smoke, were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over
half-emptied pots of beer, or playing at all-fours with a very greasy
pack of cards.  DICKENS-1837-1,546.63

In the adjoining room, some solitary tenant might be seen, poring,
by the light of a feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and
tattered papers, yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from <P_547>
age, writing, for the hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his
grievances, for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never
reach, or whose heart it would never touch.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.64

In a third, a man, with his wife and a whole crowd of children, might
be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs,
for the younger ones to pass the night in.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.65

And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, the noise ,
and the beer, and the tobacco-smoke, and the cards, all came over again
in greater force than before.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.66

In the galleries themselves, and more especially on the staircases,
there lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because
their rooms were empty and lonesome; others because their rooms were
full and hot; and the greater part because they were restless and
uncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what
to do with themselves.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.67

There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his
fustian jacket, to the broken down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown
, most appropriately out at elbows; DICKENS-1837-1,547.68

but there was the same air about them all - a kind of listless, jail-bird
, careless swagger; a vagabondish who's-afraid sort of bearing, which
is wholly indescribable in words; but which any man can understand in
one moment if he wishes, by just setting foot in the nearest debtors'
prison, and looking at the very first group of people he sees there,
with the same interest as Mr Pickwick did.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.69

'It strikes me, Sam,'said Mr Pickwick, leaning over the iron-rail at the
stair-head,'It strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for debt is scarcely
any punishment at all. 'DICKENS-1837-1,547.70

'Think not, Sir? 'inquired Mr Weller.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.71

'You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,'replied Mr
Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.72

'$It $'s {TEXT:It's} quite impossible that they can mind it much.
'DICKENS-1837-1,547.73

'Ah, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} just the wery thing, Sir,'rejoined Sam,
DICKENS-1837-1,547.74

'<font> they <$$font> $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind it; DICKENS-1837-1,547.75

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} a reg'lar holiday to them - all porter and skettles.
DICKENS-1837-1,547.76

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} the t'other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o'
thing: them down-hearted fellers as $can $n't {TEXT:can't} svig avay at
the beer, nor play skettles neither; them as vould pay if they could,
and gets low by being boxed up.  DICKENS-1837-1,547.77

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you wot it is, Sir; DICKENS-1837-1,547.78

them as is always a idlin'in public houses it $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
damage at all, DICKENS-1837-1,547.79

and them as is alvays a vorkin'ven they can, it damages too much.
DICKENS-1837-1,547.80

"$It $'s {TEXT:It's} unekal,"as my father used to say ven his grog $wor
$n't {TEXT:worn't} made half-and-half - DICKENS-1837-1,547.81

"$It $'s {TEXT:It's} unekal, DICKENS-1837-1,547.82

and $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the fault on it. "'DICKENS-1837-1,547.83

'I think $you $'re {TEXT:you're} right, Sam,'said Mr Pickwick, after a
few moments'reflection,'quite right. 'DICKENS-1837-1,547.84

'P'raps, now and then, $there $'s {TEXT:there's} some honest people as
likes it,'observed Mr Weller, in a ruminative tone, DICKENS-1837-1,547.85

'but I never heerd o'one as I can call to <P_548> mind,'cept the little
dirty-faced man in the brown coat, DICKENS-1837-1,548.86

and that was force of habit. 'DICKENS-1837-1,548.87

'And who was he? 'inquired Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.88

'Vy, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} just the wery point as nobody never know'd
,'replied Sam.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.89

'But what did he do? 'DICKENS-1837-1,548.90

'Vy he did wot many men as has been much better know'd has done in their
time, Sir,'replied Sam, DICKENS-1837-1,548.91

'he run a match agin the constable, DICKENS-1837-1,548.92

and vun it. 'DICKENS-1837-1,548.93

'In other words, I suppose,'said Mr Pickwick,'he got into debt?
'DICKENS-1837-1,548.94

'Just that, Sir,'replied Sam, DICKENS-1837-1,548.95

'and in course o'time he come here in consekens.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.96

It $war $n't {TEXT:warn't} much - execution for nine pound nothin',
multiplied by five for costs; DICKENS-1837-1,548.97

but hows'ever here he stopped for seventeen year.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.98

If he got any wrinkles in his face, they was stopped up vith the dirt,
DICKENS-1837-1,548.99

for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o'
that time as they wos at the beginnin'.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.100

He wos a wery peaceful inoffendin'little creetur, DICKENS-1837-1,548.101

and wos alvays a bustlin'about for somebody, or playin'rackets and
never vinnin'; till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him,
DICKENS-1837-1,548.102

and he wos in the lodge ev'ry night, a chattering vith'em, and tellin'
stories, and all that'ere.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.103

Vun night he wos in there as usual, alone vith a wery old friend of his,
as wos on the lock, ven he says all of a sudden,"I $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't}
seen the market outside, Bill,"he says <paren> Fleet Market wos there at
that time <$$paren> -"I $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} seen the market outside,
Bill,"he says,"for seventeen year.  "DICKENS-1837-1,548.104

"I know you $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't},"says the turnkey, smoking his pipe.
DICKENS-1837-1,548.105

"I should like to see it for a minit, Bill,"he says.
DICKENS-1837-1,548.106

"Wery probable,"says the turnkey, smoking his pipe wery fierce, and
making believe he $war $n't {TEXT:warn't} up to wot the little man wanted.
DICKENS-1837-1,548.107

"Bill,"says the little man, more abrupt than afore,"$I $'ve {TEXT:I've}
got the fancy in my head.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.108

Let me see the public street once more afore I die; and if I $ai $n't
{TEXT:ain't} struck with apoplexy, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be back in five
minits by the clock. "DICKENS-1837-1,548.109

"And wot'ud become o'me if you <font> wos <$$font> struck with
apoplexy? "said the turnkey.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.110

"Vy,"says the little creetur,"whoever found me,'ud bring me home,
DICKENS-1837-1,548.111

for $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} got my card in my pocket, Bill,"he says,
DICKENS-1837-1,548.112

"No. 20, Coffee-room Flight:"DICKENS-1837-1,548.113

and that wos true, sure enough, DICKENS-1837-1,548.114

for ven he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new comer
{COM:here_and_passim_sic}, he used to pull out a little limp card vith
them words on it and nothin'else; in consideration o'vich, he wos alvays
called Number Tventy.  DICKENS-1837-1,548.115

The turnkey takes a fixed look at him, DICKENS-1837-1,548.116

and at last he says in a solemn manner,"Tventy,"he says,"$I $'ll
{TEXT:I'll} trust you; DICKENS-1837-1,548.117

you $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} get your old friend into trouble. "
DICKENS-1837-1,548.118

"No, my boy; I hope $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} somethin'better behind here,
"says the little man, DICKENS-1837-1,548.119

and as he said it, he hit his little veskit wery hard,
DICKENS-1837-1,548.120

and then a tear started out o'each eye, which wos wery extraordinary;
DICKENS-1837-1,548.121

for it <P_549> wos supposed as water never touched his face.
DICKENS-1837-1,549.122

He shook the turnkey by the hand; DICKENS-1837-1,549.123

out he vent -'DICKENS-1837-1,549.124

'And never came back again,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.125

'Wrong for vunce, Sir,'replied Mr Weller, DICKENS-1837-1,549.126

'for back he come two minits afore the time, a bilin'vith rage, sayin'
how $he $'d {TEXT:he'd} been nearly run over by a hackney coach; that
he $war $n't {TEXT:warn't} used to it, and he wos blowed if he $would
$n't {TEXT:wouldn't} write to the Lord Mayor.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.127

They got him pacified at last; DICKENS-1837-1,549.128

and for five year arter that, he never even so much as peeped out o'
the lodge-gate. 'DICKENS-1837-1,549.129

'At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose,'said Mr Pickwick.
DICKENS-1837-1,549.130

'No he $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}, Sir,'replied Sam.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.131

'He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public-house over
the way, on the premises; DICKENS-1837-1,549.132

and it wos such a wery nice parlour, that he took it into his head to
go there every night, which he did for a long time, alvays comin' back
reg'lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut, which wos all
wery snug and comfortable.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.133

At last he began to get so precious jolly, that he used to forget how
the time vent, or care nothin'at all about it, DICKENS-1837-1,549.134

and he vent on gettin'later and later, till vun night his old friend wos
just a shuttin'the gate - had turned the key in fact - ven he come up.
DICKENS-1837-1,549.135

"Hold hard, Bill,"he says.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.136

"Wot, $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} you come home yet, Tventy? "says the turnkey,
DICKENS-1837-1,549.137

"I thought you was in long ago. "DICKENS-1837-1,549.138

"No I $was $n't {TEXT:wasn't},"says the little man, vith a smile.
DICKENS-1837-1,549.139

"Vell then, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you wot it is, my friend ,"says
the turnkey, openin'the gate wery slow and sulky, DICKENS-1837-1,549.140

"$it $'s {TEXT:it's} my'pinion as $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} got into
bad company o'late, which $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} wery sorry to see.
DICKENS-1837-1,549.141

Now I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} wish to do anything harsh,"he says,
DICKENS-1837-1,549.142

"but if you $can $n't {TEXT:can't} confine yourself to steady
circles , and find your vay back at reg'lar hours, as sure as $you
$'re {TEXT:you're} a standin'there, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} shut you out
altogether! "DICKENS-1837-1,549.143

The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o'tremblin',
DICKENS-1837-1,549.144

and never vent outside the prison walls artervards! '
DICKENS-1837-1,549.145

As Sam concluded, Mr Pickwick slowly retraced his steps down stairs.
DICKENS-1837-1,549.146

After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was
now dark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr Weller that he thought
it high time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek
a bed in some adjacent public house, and return early in the morning,
to make arrangements for the removal of his master's wardrobe from the
George and Vulture.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.147

This request Mr Samuel Weller prepared to obey, with as good a grace
as he could assume, but with a very considerable show of reluctance
nevertheless.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.148

He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints regarding
the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that night;
DICKENS-1837-1,549.149

but finding Mr Pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions,
finally withdrew.  DICKENS-1837-1,549.150

There is no disguising the fact that Mr Pickwick felt very
low-spirited <P_550> and uncomfortable - not for lack of society,
DICKENS-1837-1,550.151

for the prison was very full, DICKENS-1837-1,550.152

and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost
good-fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony
of introduction; DICKENS-1837-1,550.153

but he was alone in the coarse vulgar crowd, DICKENS-1837-1,550.154

and felt the depression of spirit and sinking of heart, naturally
consequent upon the reflection that he was cooped and caged up without
a prospect of liberation.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.155

As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness
of Dodson & Fogg, it never for an instant entered his thoughts.
DICKENS-1837-1,550.156

In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery,
DICKENS-1837-1,550.157

and walked slowly to and fro.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.158

The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly
suffocating.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.159

There was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went
in and out, DICKENS-1837-1,550.160

and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through
the passages constantly.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.161

A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to
crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage
in conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see her in.
DICKENS-1837-1,550.162

As they passed Mr Pickwick, he could hear the female sob bitterly;
DICKENS-1837-1,550.163

and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled
to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the child in
his arms, and tried to soothe her.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.164

Mr Pickwick's heart was really too full to bear it, DICKENS-1837-1,550.165

and he went up stairs to bed.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.166

Now, although the warden's room was a very uncomfortable one, being,
in every point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees
inferior to the commonest infirmary of a county gaol, it had at present
the merit of being wholly deserted, save by Mr Pickwick himself.
DICKENS-1837-1,550.167

So, he sat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead,
DICKENS-1837-1,550.168

and began to wonder how much a year the warden made out of the dirty room.
DICKENS-1837-1,550.169

Having satisfied himself, by mathematical calculation, that the apartment
was about equal in annual value to the freehold of a small street in the
suburbs of London, he took to wondering what possible temptation could
have induced a dingy-looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons,
to come into a close prison, when he had the choice of so many airy
situations - a course of meditation which led him to the irresistible
conclusion that the insect was insane.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.170

After settling this point, he began to be conscious that he was getting
sleepy; whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in which he had
had the precaution to stow it in the morning, and, leisurely undressing
himself, got into bed, and fell asleep.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.171

'Bravo!  Heel over toe - DICKENS-1837-1,550.172

cut and shuffle - DICKENS-1837-1,550.173

pay away at it, Zephyr!  DICKENS-1837-1,550.174

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} smothered if the Opera House $is $n't {TEXT:isn't}
your proper hemisphere.  DICKENS-1837-1,550.175

Keep it up.  Hooray! 'DICKENS-1837-1,550.176

These expressions, delivered in a most boisterous tone, and <P_551>
accompanied with loud peals of laughter, roused Mr Pickwick from one of
those sound slumbers which, lasting in reality some half hour, seem to
the sleeper to have been protracted for about three weeks or a month.
DICKENS-1837-1,551.177

The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such
violence that the windows rattled in their frames, and the bedsteads
trembled again.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.178

Mr Pickwick started up, DICKENS-1837-1,551.179

and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene
before him.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.180

On the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat,
with corderoy {COM:sic} knee smalls and grey cotton stockings, was
performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and
burlesque caricature of grace and lightness, which, combined with the
very appropriate character of his costume, was inexpressibly absurd.
DICKENS-1837-1,551.181

Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed
by his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as
he could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental
feeling and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads,
was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur,
and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused
Mr Pickwick from his sleep.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.182

This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never
can be seen in full perfection but in such places; DICKENS-1837-1,551.183

- they may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about
stable-yards and public houses; DICKENS-1837-1,551.184

but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds, which
would almost seem to be considerately provided by the Legislature for
the sole purpose of rearing them.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.185

He was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair, and very
thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.186

He wore no neckerchief, as he had been playing rackets all day,
DICKENS-1837-1,551.187

and his open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance.
DICKENS-1837-1,551.188

On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull-caps,
with a gawdy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in keeping with a
common fustian coat.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.189

His legs, which, being long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair
of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of the limbs.
DICKENS-1837-1,551.190

Being somewhat negligently braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly
buttoned, they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a
pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled
white stockings.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.191

There was a rakish vagabond smartness, and a kind of boastful
rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a mine of gold.
DICKENS-1837-1,551.192

This figure was the first to perceive that Mr Pickwick was looking on ;
upon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated him, with mock gravity,
not to wake the gentleman.  DICKENS-1837-1,551.193

<P_552>

{COM:illustration_omitted}

<P_553>

'Why, bless the gentleman's honest heart and soul! 'said the
Zephyr, turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise;
DICKENS-1837-1,553.197

'the gentleman <font> is <$$font> awake.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.198

Hem; Shakspeare.  How do you do, Sir?  DICKENS-1837-1,553.199

How is Mary and Sarah, Sir?  and the dear old lady at home, Sir - eh, Sir?
DICKENS-1837-1,553.200

Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little
parcel $you $'re {TEXT:you're} sending that way, Sir, and say that I
would have sent'em before, only I was afraid they might be broken in
the waggon, Sir? 'DICKENS-1837-1,553.201

'$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} overwhelm the gentleman with ordinary
civilities when you see $he $'s {TEXT:he's} anxious to have something
to drink ,'said the gentleman with the whiskers, with a jocose air.
DICKENS-1837-1,553.202

'Why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you ask the gentleman what $he $'ll
{TEXT:he'll} take? 'DICKENS-1837-1,553.203

'Dear me - I quite forgot,'replied the other.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.204

'What <font> will <$$font> you take, Sir?  DICKENS-1837-1,553.205

Will you take port wine, Sir, or sherry wine, Sir?  DICKENS-1837-1,553.206

I can recommend the ale, Sir; DICKENS-1837-1,553.207

or perhaps $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} like to taste the porter, Sir?
DICKENS-1837-1,553.208

Allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.
'DICKENS-1837-1,553.209

With this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr Pickwick's
head, DICKENS-1837-1,553.210

and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man, who, firmly
impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly,
continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy
strains imaginable.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.211

Taking a man's nightcap from his brow by violent means, and adjusting it
on the head of an unknown gentleman of dirty exterior, however ingenious
a witticism in itself, is unquestionably one of those which come under
the denomination of practical jokes.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.212

Viewing the matter precisely in this light, Mr Pickwick, without the
slightest intimation of his purpose, sprang vigorously out of bed;
DICKENS-1837-1,553.213

struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the chest, as to deprive him of a
considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name;
DICKENS-1837-1,553.214

and then, recapturing his nightcap, boldly placed himself in an attitude
of defence.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.215

'Now,'said Mr Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than from the
expenditure of so much energy,'come on - both of you - both of you.
'DICKENS-1837-1,553.216

And with this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated
a revolving motion to his clenched fists, by way of appalling his
antagonists with a display of science.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.217

It might have been Mr Pickwick's very unexpected gallantry, or it might
have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of
bed, and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his
adversaries.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.218

Touched they were; DICKENS-1837-1,553.219

for, instead of then and there making an attempt to commit manslaughter,
as Mr Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done, they paused,
DICKENS-1837-1,553.220

stared at each other a short time, DICKENS-1837-1,553.221

and finally laughed outright.  DICKENS-1837-1,553.222

<P_554>

'Well; $you $'re {TEXT:you're} a trump, DICKENS-1837-1,554.224

and I like you all the better for it,'said the Zephyr.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.225

'Now jump into bed again, or $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} catch the rheumatics.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.226

No malice, I hope? 'said the man, extending a hand about the size of
the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover's door.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.227

'Certainly not,'said Mr Pickwick, with great alacrity;
DICKENS-1837-1,554.228

for, now that the excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool
about the legs.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.229

'Allow me the honour, Sir? 'said the gentleman with the whiskers,
presenting his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.230

'With much pleasure, Sir,'said Mr Pickwick; DICKENS-1837-1,554.231

and having executed a very long and solemn shake, he got into bed again.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.232

'My name is Smangle, Sir,'said the man with the whiskers.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.233

'Oh,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.234

'Mine is Mivins,'said the man in the stockings.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.235

'I am delighted to hear it, Sir,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.236

'Hem,'coughed Mr Smangle.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.237

'Did you speak, Sir? 'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.238

'No, I did not, Sir,'said Mr Smangle.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.239

'I thought you did, Sir,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.240

All this was very genteel and pleasant; DICKENS-1837-1,554.241

and, to make matters still more comfortable, Mr Smangle assured Mr
Pickwick a great many times that he entertained a very high respect
for the feelings of a gentleman; which sentiment, indeed, did him
infinite credit, as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.242

'Are you going through the Court, Sir? 'inquired Mr Smangle.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.243

'Through the what? 'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.244

'Through the Court - Portugal Street - the Court for the Relief of -
you know. 'DICKENS-1837-1,554.245

'Oh, no,'replied Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.246

'No, I am not. 'DICKENS-1837-1,554.247

'Going out, perhaps? 'suggested Mivins.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.248

'I fear not,'replied Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.249

'I refuse to pay some damages, DICKENS-1837-1,554.250

and am here in consequence. 'DICKENS-1837-1,554.251

'Ah,'said Mr Smangle, DICKENS-1837-1,554.252

'paper has been my ruin. 'DICKENS-1837-1,554.253

'A stationer, I presume, Sir? 'said Mr Pickwick, innocently.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.254

'Stationer!  DICKENS-1837-1,554.255

No, no; confound and curse me!  DICKENS-1837-1,554.256

- not so low as that.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.257

No trade.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.258

When I say paper, I mean bills. 'DICKENS-1837-1,554.259

'Oh, you use the word in that sense.  I see,'said Mr Pickwick.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.260

'$Dam $me {TEXT:Damme}!  a gentleman must expect reverses,'said Smangle.
DICKENS-1837-1,554.261

'What of that?  DICKENS-1837-1,554.262

Here am I in the Fleet Prison.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.263

Well; good.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.264

What then?  DICKENS-1837-1,554.265

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} none the worse for that, am I? ' DICKENS-1837-1,554.266

'Not a bit,'replied Mr Mivins.  DICKENS-1837-1,554.267

And he was quite right; DICKENS-1837-1,554.268

for, so far from <P_555> Mr Smangle being any the worse for it, he was
something the better, inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place,
he had attained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery
, which, long before that, had found their way to the pawnbroker's.
DICKENS-1837-1,555.269

'Well; but come,'said Mr Smangle; DICKENS-1837-1,555.270

'this is dry work.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.271

$Let $'s {TEXT:Let's} rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry;
DICKENS-1837-1,555.272

the last comer shall stand it, DICKENS-1837-1,555.273

Mivins shall fetch it, DICKENS-1837-1,555.274

and $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} help to drink it.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.275

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour,
any how - curse me! 'DICKENS-1837-1,555.276

Unwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr Pickwick gladly assented to the
proposition, DICKENS-1837-1,555.277

and consigned the money to Mr Mivins, who, as it was nearly eleven
o'clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his errand.
DICKENS-1837-1,555.278

'I say,'whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left the room;
'what did you give him? 'DICKENS-1837-1,555.279

'Half a sovereign,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.280

'$He $'s {TEXT:He's} a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,'said Mr Smangle;
-'infernal pleasant.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.281

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know anybody more so; DICKENS-1837-1,555.282

but -'DICKENS-1837-1,555.283

Here Mr Smangle stopped short, DICKENS-1837-1,555.284

and shook his head dubiously.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.285

'You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think there is any probability of
his appropriating the money to his own use? 'said Mr Pickwick.
DICKENS-1837-1,555.286

'Oh, no - mind, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} say that; DICKENS-1837-1,555.287

I expressly say that $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a devilish gentlemanly fellow,
'said Mr Smangle.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.288

'But I think, perhaps, if somebody went down, just to see that he $did
$n't {TEXT:didn't} drop his beak into the jug by accident, or make some
confounded mistake in losing the money as he came up stairs, it would
be as well.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.289

Here, you Sir, just run down stairs, DICKENS-1837-1,555.290

and look after that gentleman, will you? 'DICKENS-1837-1,555.291

This request was addressed to a little, timid-looking, nervous man,
whose appearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been crouching on
his bedstead all this while, apparently quite stupified by the novelty
of his situation.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.292

'You know where the coffee-room is,'said Smangle; DICKENS-1837-1,555.293

'just run down, DICKENS-1837-1,555.294

and tell that gentleman $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} come to help him up with
the jug.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.295

Or - stop - $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you what - $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell
you how $we $'ll {TEXT:we'll} do him,'said Smangle, with a cunning look.
DICKENS-1837-1,555.296

'How? 'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.297

'Send down word that $he $'s {TEXT:he's} to spend the change in cigars.
DICKENS-1837-1,555.298

Capital thought.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.299

Run DICKENS-1837-1,555.300

and tell him that; $d $'ye {TEXT:d'ye} hear?  DICKENS-1837-1,555.301

They $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't} be wasted,'continued Smangle, turning to
Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,555.302

'<font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} <$$font> smoke'em. ' DICKENS-1837-1,555.303

This manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious, and, withal, performed
with such immoveable composure and coolness, that Mr Pickwick would
<P_556> have had no wish to disturb it, even if he had had the power.
DICKENS-1837-1,556.304

In a short time Mr Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr Smangle
dispensed in two little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with
reference to himself, that a gentleman must not be particular under
such circumstances, and, for his part, he was not too proud to drink
out of the jug; in which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged
the company in a draught which half emptied it.  DICKENS-1837-1,556.305

An excellent understanding having been, by these means, promoted, Mr
Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers
romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged,
involving various interesting anecdotes of a thorough-bred horse, and a
magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the
nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.  DICKENS-1837-1,556.306

Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman
were concluded, Mr Mivins had betaken himself to bed, and set in snoring
for the night: leaving the timid stranger and Mr Pickwick to the full
benefit of Mr Smangle's experiences.  DICKENS-1837-1,556.307

Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have
been by the moving passages which were narrated.  DICKENS-1837-1,556.308

Mr Pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time, when he had a
faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic
song, and receiving from Mr Smangle a gentle intimation, through the
medium of the water jug, that his audience were not musically disposed.
DICKENS-1837-1,556.309

He then once again dropped off to sleep, with a confused consciousness
that Mr Smangle was still engaged in relating a long story, the chief
point of which appeared to be, that, on some occasion particularly stated
and set forth, he had'done'a bill and a gentleman at the same time.
DICKENS-1837-1,556.310

<font> Illustrative, like the preceding one, of the old Proverb,

Likewise containing Mr Pickwick's extraordinary and startling announcement
to Mr Samuel Weller <$$font> DICKENS-1837-1,557.315

<$$heading>

When Mr Pickwick opened his eyes next morning, the first object upon which
they rested was Samuel Weller, seated upon a small black portmanteau,
intently regarding, apparently in a condition of profound abstraction,
the stately figure of the dashing Mr Smangle, while Mr Smangle himself,
who was already partially dressed, was seated on his bedstead, occupied in
the desperately hopeless attempt of staring Mr Weller out of countenance.
DICKENS-1837-1,557.317

We say desperately hopeless, because Sam, with a comprehensive gaze ,
which took in Mr Smangle's cap, feet, head, face, legs, and whiskers, all
at the same time, continued to look steadily on with every demonstration
of lively satisfaction, but with no more regard to Mr Smangle's
personal sentiments on the subject, than he would have displayed had
he been inspecting a wooden statue, or a straw-embowelled Guy Faux.
DICKENS-1837-1,557.318

'Well; will you know me again? 'said Mr Smangle, with a frown.
DICKENS-1837-1,557.319

'$I $'d {TEXT:I'd} svear to you any veres, Sir,'replied Sam, cheerfully.
DICKENS-1837-1,557.320

'$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} be impertinent to a gentleman, Sir,'said Mr
Smangle.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.321

'Not on no account,'replied Sam.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.322

'If $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} tell me ven he wakes, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll}
be upon the wery best extra-super behaviour! 'DICKENS-1837-1,557.323

This observation, having a remote tendency to imply that Mr Smangle was
no gentleman, rather kindled his ire.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.324

'Mivins! 'said Mr Smangle, with a passionate air.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.325

'$What $'s {TEXT:What's} the office? 'replied that gentleman from
his couch.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.326

'Who the devil is this fellow? 'DICKENS-1837-1,557.327

'Gad,'said Mr Mivins, looking lazily out from under the bedclothes ,
DICKENS-1837-1,557.328

'I ought to ask <font> you <$$font> that.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.329

$Has $n't {TEXT:Hasn't} he any business here? 'DICKENS-1837-1,557.330

'No,'replied Mr Smangle.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.331

'Then knock him down stairs, DICKENS-1837-1,557.332

and tell him not to presume to get up till I come and kick him,' rejoined
Mr Mivins; DICKENS-1837-1,557.333

and with this prompt advice, that excellent gentleman again betook
himself to slumber.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.334

The conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of rather verging
on the personal, Mr Pickwick deemed it a fit point at which to interpose.
DICKENS-1837-1,557.335

'Sam,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,557.336

<P_558>

'Sir,'rejoined that gentleman.  DICKENS-1837-1,558.338

'Has anything new occurred since last night? 'DICKENS-1837-1,558.339

'Nothin'partickler, Sir,'replied Sam, glancing at Mr Smangle's whiskers;
DICKENS-1837-1,558.340

'the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere has been rayther
favourable to the growth of veeds, of an alarmin'and sangvinary natur
{COM:sic}; DICKENS-1837-1,558.341

but vith that'ere exception things is quiet enough. '
DICKENS-1837-1,558.342

'I shall get up,'said Mr Pickwick; DICKENS-1837-1,558.343

'give me some clean things. 'DICKENS-1837-1,558.344

Whatever hostile intentions Mr Smangle might have entertained, his
thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau; the
contents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable
opinion, not only of Mr Pickwick, but of Sam also, who, he took an
early opportunity of declaring, in a tone of voice loud enough for that
eccentric personage to overhear, was a regular thorough-bred original,
and consequently the very man after his own heart.  DICKENS-1837-1,558.345

As to Mr Pickwick, the affection he conceived for him knew no limits.
DICKENS-1837-1,558.346

'Now is there anything I can do for you, my dear Sir? 'said Smangle.
DICKENS-1837-1,558.347

'Nothing that I am aware of, DICKENS-1837-1,558.348

I am obliged to you,'replied Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,558.349

'No linen that you want sent to the washerwoman's?  DICKENS-1837-1,558.350

I know a delightful washerwoman outside, that comes for my things twice
a week, DICKENS-1837-1,558.351

and, by Jove!  - how devilish lucky!  - this is the very day she calls.

the way to assist another gentleman in the same condition, $what $'s
{TEXT:what's} human nature? 'DICKENS-1837-1,558.356

Thus spake Mr Smangle, edging himself meanwhile as near as possible
to the portmanteau, and beaming forth looks of the most fervent and
disinterested friendship.  DICKENS-1837-1,558.357

'$There $'s {TEXT:There's} nothing you want to give out for
the man to brush, my dear creature, is there? 'resumed Smangle.
DICKENS-1837-1,558.358

'Nothin'whoever, my fine feller,'rejoined Sam, taking the reply into
his own mouth.  DICKENS-1837-1,558.359

'P'raps if vun of us wos to brush, without troubling the man, it
'ud be more agreeable for all parties, as the school-master said
ven the young gentleman objected to being flogged by the butler.
'DICKENS-1837-1,558.360

'And $there $'s {TEXT:there's} nothing that I can send in my little box
to the washerwoman's, is there? 'said Smangle, turning from Sam to Mr
Pickwick with an air of some discomfiture.  DICKENS-1837-1,558.361

'Nothin'whatever, Sir,'retorted Sam; DICKENS-1837-1,558.362

'$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} afeerd the little box must be chock full o'your own
as it is. 'DICKENS-1837-1,558.363

This speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that
particular portion of Mr Smangle's attire, by the appearance of which the
<P_559> skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen's linen is generally
tested, that he was fain to turn upon his heel, and, for the present
at any rate, to give up all design on Mr Pickwick's purse and wardrobe.
DICKENS-1837-1,559.364

He accordingly retired in dudgeon to the racket-ground, where he made
a light and wholesome breakfast upon a couple of the cigars which had
been purchased on the previous night.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.365

Mr Mivins, who was no smoker, and whose account for small articles
of chandlery had also reached down to the bottom of the slate,
and been'carried over'to the other side, remained in bed,
DICKENS-1837-1,559.366

and, in his own words,'took it out in sleep. ' DICKENS-1837-1,559.367

After breakfasting in a small closet attached to the coffee-room, which
bore the imposing title of the Snuggery, the temporary inmate of which
, in consideration of a small additional charge, has the unspeakable
advantage of overhearing all the conversation in the coffee-room
aforesaid; and after despatching Mr Weller on some necessary errands,
Mr Pickwick repaired to the Lodge, to consult Mr Roker concerning his
future accommodation.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.368

'Accommodation, eh? 'said that gentleman, consulting a large book ;
DICKENS-1837-1,559.369

'Plenty of that, Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.370

Your chummage ticket will be on twenty-seven, in the third. '
DICKENS-1837-1,559.371

'Oh,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.372

'My what, did you say? 'DICKENS-1837-1,559.373

'Your chummage ticket,'replied Mr Roker; DICKENS-1837-1,559.374

'$you $'re {TEXT:you're} up to that? 'DICKENS-1837-1,559.375

'Not quite,'replied Mr Pickwick, with a smile.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.376

'Why,'said Mr Roker,'$it $'s {TEXT:it's} as plain as Salisbury.
DICKENS-1837-1,559.377

$You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} have a chummage ticket upon twenty-seven in the
third, DICKENS-1837-1,559.378

and them as is in the room will be your chums. 'DICKENS-1837-1,559.379

'Are there many of them? 'inquired Mr Pickwick, dubiously.
DICKENS-1837-1,559.380

'Three,'replied Mr Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.381

Mr Pickwick coughed.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.382

'One of'em $'s {TEXT:'em's} a parson,'said Mr Roker, filling up a little
piece of paper as he spoke, DICKENS-1837-1,559.383

'$another $'s {TEXT:another's} a butcher. 'DICKENS-1837-1,559.384

'Eh? 'exclaimed Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.385

'A butcher,'repeated Mr Roker, giving the nib of his pen a tap on the
desk to cure it of a disinclination to mark.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.386

'What a thorough-paced goer he used to be sure-ly {COM:sic}!
DICKENS-1837-1,559.387

You remember Tom Martin, Neddy? 'said Roker, appealing to another man in
the lodge, who was paring the mud off his shoes with a five-and-twenty
bladed pocket knife.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.388

'I should think so,'replied the party addressed, with a strong emphasis
on the personal pronoun.  DICKENS-1837-1,559.389

'Bless my dear eyes,'said Mr Roker, shaking his head slowly from side
to side, and gazing abstractedly out of the grated window before him,
as if <P_560> he were fondly recalling some peaceful scene of his early
youth;'it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal-heaver down
Fox-under-the-Hill by the wharf there.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.390

I think I can see him now, a coming up the Strand between the two
street-keepers, a little sobered by the bruising, with a patch o'
winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid, and that'ere lovely
bull-dog, as pinned the little boy arterwards, a following at his heels.
DICKENS-1837-1,560.391

What a rum thing time is, $ai $n't {TEXT:ain't} it, Neddy? '
DICKENS-1837-1,560.392

The gentleman to whom these observations were addressed, who appeared
of a taciturn and thoughtful cast, merely echoed the inquiry;
DICKENS-1837-1,560.393

and Mr Roker, shaking off the poetical and gloomy train of thought into
which he had been betrayed, descended to the common business of life,
DICKENS-1837-1,560.394

and resumed his pen.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.395

'Do you know what the third gentleman is? 'inquired Mr Pickwick,
not very much gratified by this description of his future associates.
DICKENS-1837-1,560.396

'What is that Simpson, Neddy? 'said Mr Roker, turning to his companion.
DICKENS-1837-1,560.397

'What Simpson? 'said Neddy.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.398

'Why him in twenty-seven in the third, that this $gentleman $'s
{TEXT:gentleman's} going to be chummed on. 'DICKENS-1837-1,560.399

'Oh, him! 'replied Neddy: DICKENS-1837-1,560.400

'$he $'s {TEXT:he's} nothing exactly.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.401

He <font> was <$$font> a horse chaunter: DICKENS-1837-1,560.402

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} a leg now. 'DICKENS-1837-1,560.403

'Ah, so I thought,'rejoined Mr Roker, closing the book, and placing the
small piece of paper in Mr Pickwick's hands - DICKENS-1837-1,560.404

'$That $'s {TEXT:That's} the ticket, Sir. 'DICKENS-1837-1,560.405

Very much perplexed by this summary disposition of his person, Mr Pickwick
walked back into the prison, revolving in his mind what he had better do.
DICKENS-1837-1,560.406

Convinced, however, that before he took any other steps it would be
advisable to see, and hold personal converse with, the three gentlemen
with whom it was proposed to quarter him, he made the best of his way
to the third flight.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.407

After groping about in the gallery for some time, attempting in the
dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors, he at length
appealed to a potboy, who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation
of gleaning for pewter.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.408

'Which is twenty-seven, my good fellow? 'said Mr Pickwick.
DICKENS-1837-1,560.409

'Five doors further on,'replied the potboy.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.410

'$There $'s {TEXT:There's} the likeness of a man being hung, and smoking
a pipe the while, chalked outside the door. 'DICKENS-1837-1,560.411

Guided by this direction, Mr Pickwick proceeded slowly along the gallery
until he encountered the'portrait of a gentleman,'above described,
upon whose countenance he tapped, with the knuckle of his fore-finger -
gently at first, and then more audibly.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.412

After repeating this process several times without effect, he ventured
to open the door and peep in.  DICKENS-1837-1,560.413

<P_561>

There was only one man in the room, DICKENS-1837-1,561.415

and he was leaning out of window {COM:sic} as far as he could without
over-balancing himself, endeavouring with great perseverance to spit
upon the crown of the hat of a personal friend on the parade below.
DICKENS-1837-1,561.416

As neither speaking, coughing, sneezing, knocking, nor any other ordinary
mode of attracting attention, made this person aware of the presence of
a visiter {COM:sic}, Mr Pickwick, after some delay, stepped up to the
window, DICKENS-1837-1,561.417

and pulled him gently by the coat-tail.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.418

The individual brought in his head and shoulders with great swiftness,
DICKENS-1837-1,561.419

and surveying Mr Pickwick from head to foot, demanded in a surly
tone what the - something beginning with a capital H - he wanted.
DICKENS-1837-1,561.420

'I believe,'said Mr Pickwick, consulting his ticket,'I believe this is
twenty-seven in the third. 'DICKENS-1837-1,561.421

'Well? 'replied the gentleman.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.422

'I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper,
'rejoined Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.423

'Hand it over,'said the gentleman.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.424

Mr Pickwick complied.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.425

'I think Roker might have chummed you somewhere else,'said Mr Simpson
<paren> for it was the leg <$$paren>, after a very discontented sort of
a pause.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.426

Mr Pickwick thought so also; DICKENS-1837-1,561.427

but, under all the circumstances, he considered it a matter of sound
policy to be silent.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.428

Mr Simpson mused for a few moments after this, DICKENS-1837-1,561.429

and then, thrusting his head out of the window, gave a shrill whistle ,
DICKENS-1837-1,561.430

and pronounced some word aloud several times.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.431

What the word was, Mr Pickwick could not distinguish;
DICKENS-1837-1,561.432

but he rather inferred that it must be some nickname which distinguished
Mr Martin, from the fact of a great number of gentlemen on the ground
below, immediately proceeding to cry'Butcher,'in imitation of the tone
in which that useful class of society are wont diurnally to make their
presence known at area railings.  DICKENS-1837-1,561.433

Subsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of Mr Pickwick's impression
; DICKENS-1837-1,561.434

for, in a few seconds, a gentleman, prematurely broad for his years,
clothed in a professional blue jean frock, and top-boots with circular
toes, entered the room nearly out of breath, closely followed
by another gentleman in very shabby black, and a seal-skin cap.
DICKENS-1837-1,561.435

The latter gentleman, who fastened his coat all the way up to his chin
by means of a pin and a button alternately, had a very coarse red face ,
DICKENS-1837-1,561.436

and looked like a drunken chaplain, which, indeed, he was.
DICKENS-1837-1,561.437

These two gentlemen having by turns perused Mr Pickwick's billet, the
one expressed his opinion that it was'a rig,'and the other his conviction
that it was'a go. 'DICKENS-1837-1,561.438

Having recorded their feelings in these very <P_562> intelligible
terms, they looked at Mr Pickwick and each other in awkward silence.
DICKENS-1837-1,562.439

'$It $'s {TEXT:It's} an aggravating thing, just as we got the beds so
snug,'said the chaplain, looking at three dirty mattresses, each rolled up
in a blanket, which occupied one corner of the room during the day, and
formed a kind of slab, on which were placed an old cracked basin, ewer,
and soap-dish, of common yellow earthenware, with a blue flower:'Very
aggravating. 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.440

Mr Martin expressed the same opinion, in rather stronger terms;
DICKENS-1837-1,562.441

Mr Simpson, after having let a variety of expletive adjectives loose
upon society without any substantive to accompany them, tucked up his
sleeves, DICKENS-1837-1,562.442

and began to wash the greens for dinner.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.443

While this was going on, Mr Pickwick had been eyeing the room, which
was filthily dirty, and smelt intolerably close.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.444

There was no vestige of either carpet, curtain, or blind.
DICKENS-1837-1,562.445

There was not even a closet in it.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.446

Unquestionably there were but few things to put away, if there had been
one; DICKENS-1837-1,562.447

but, however few in number, or small in individual amount, still remnants
of loaves, and pieces of cheese, and damp towels, and scraps of meat,
and articles of wearing apparel, and mutilated crockery, and bellows
without nozzles, and toasting-forks without prongs, <font> do <$$font>
present something of an uncomfortable appearance when they are scattered
about the floor of a small apartment, which is the common sitting and
sleeping room of three idle men.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.448

'I suppose this can be managed somehow,'said the butcher, after a pretty
long silence.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.449

'What will you take to go out? 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.450

'I beg your pardon,'replied Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.451

'What did you say?  DICKENS-1837-1,562.452

I hardly understand you. 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.453

'What will you take to be paid out? 'said the butcher.
DICKENS-1837-1,562.454

'The regular chummage is two-and-sixpence.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.455

Will you take three bob? 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.456

'- And a bender,'suggested the clerical gentleman.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.457

'Well, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind that; DICKENS-1837-1,562.458

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} only twopence a-piece more,'said Mr Martin.
DICKENS-1837-1,562.459

'What do you say now?  DICKENS-1837-1,562.460

$We $'ll {TEXT:We'll} pay you out for three-and-sixpence a week.
DICKENS-1837-1,562.461

Come. 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.462

'And stand a gallon of beer down,'chimed in Mr Simpson.
DICKENS-1837-1,562.463

'There. 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.464

'And drink it on the spot,'said the chaplain.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.465

'Now. 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.466

'I really am so wholly ignorant of the rules of this place,'returned Mr
Pickwick,'that I do not yet comprehend you.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.467

<font> Can <$$font> I live anywhere else?  DICKENS-1837-1,562.468

I thought I could not. 'DICKENS-1837-1,562.469

At this inquiry Mr Martin looked with a countenance of excessive surprise
at his two friends, DICKENS-1837-1,562.470

and then each gentleman pointed with his right thumb over his left
shoulder.  DICKENS-1837-1,562.471

This action, imperfectly described in words by the very feeble term
of'over the left,'when performed by any number of ladies <P_563> or
gentlemen who are accustomed to act in unison, has a very graceful and
airy effect; DICKENS-1837-1,563.472

its expression is one of light and playful sarcasm.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.473

'<font> Can <$$font> you! 'repeated Mr Martin, with a smile of pity.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.474

'Well, if I knew as little of life as that, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd}
eat my hat and swallow the buckle,'said the clerical gentleman.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.475

'So would I,'added the sporting one, solemnly.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.476

After this introductory preface, the three chums informed Mr Pickwick
in a breath, that money was, in the Fleet, just what money was out of
it; that it would instantly procure him almost anything he desired;
and that, supposing he had got it, and had no objection to spend it,
if he only signified his wish to have a room to himself, he might take
possession of one, furnished and fitted to boot, in half an hour's time.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.477

With this, the parties separated, very much to their mutual satisfaction
; Mr Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge, and the three
companions adjourning to the coffee-room, there to expend the five
shillings which the clerical gentleman had, with admirable prudence and
foresight, borrowed of him for the purpose.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.478

'I knowed it! 'said Mr Roker, with a chuckle, when Mr Pickwick stated
the object with which he had returned.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.479

'$Did $n't {TEXT:Didn't} I say so, Neddy? 'DICKENS-1837-1,563.480

The philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an affirmative.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.481

'I knowed $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} want a room for yourself, bless you!
'said Mr Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.482

'Let me see.  $You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} want some furniture.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.483

$You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} hire that of me, I suppose?
DICKENS-1837-1,563.484

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} the reg'lar thing. 'DICKENS-1837-1,563.485

'With great pleasure,'replied Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.486

'$There $'s {TEXT:There's} a capital room up in the coffee-room
flight, that belongs to a Chancery prisoner,'said Mr Roker.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.487

'$It $'ll {TEXT:It'll} stand you in a pound a-week.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.488

I suppose you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind that? 'DICKENS-1837-1,563.489

'Not at all,'said Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.490

'Just step there with me,'said Roker, taking up his hat with great
alacrity; DICKENS-1837-1,563.491

'the $matter $'s {TEXT:matter's} settled in five minutes.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.492

Lord!  why $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} you say at first that you was willing
to come down handsome? 'DICKENS-1837-1,563.493

The matter was soon arranged, as the turnkey had foretold.
DICKENS-1837-1,563.494

The Chancery prisoner had been there long enough to have lost friends,
fortune, home, and happiness, and to have acquired the right of having
a room to himself.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.495

As he laboured, however, under the slight inconvenience of often wanting
a morsel of bread, he eagerly listened to Mr Pickwick's proposal to rent
the apartment; DICKENS-1837-1,563.496

and readily covenanted and agreed to yield him up the sole and undisturbed
possession thereof, in consideration of the weekly payment of twenty
shillings; from which fund he furthermore contracted to pay out any
person or persons that might be chummed upon it.  DICKENS-1837-1,563.497

<P_564>

As they struck the bargain, Mr Pickwick surveyed him with a painful
interest.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.499

He was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous man, in an old great coat and slippers,
with sunken cheeks, and a restless, eager eye.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.500

His lips were bloodless, and his bones sharp and thin.
DICKENS-1837-1,564.501

God help him!  DICKENS-1837-1,564.502

the iron teeth of confinement and privation had been slowly filing them
down for twenty years.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.503

'And where will you live meanwhile, Sir? 'said Mr Pickwick, as he laid
the amount of the first week's rent in advance on the tottering table.
DICKENS-1837-1,564.504

The man gathered up the money with a trembling hand,
DICKENS-1837-1,564.505

and replied that he $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} know yet;
DICKENS-1837-1,564.506

he must go and see where he could move his bed to.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.507

'I am afraid, Sir,'said Mr Pickwick, laying his hand gently and
compassionately on his arm; -'I am afraid you will have to live in some
noisy crowded place.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.508

Now, pray, consider this room your own when you want quiet, or when any
of your friends come to see you. 'DICKENS-1837-1,564.509

'Friends! 'interposed the man, in a voice which rattled in his throat.
DICKENS-1837-1,564.510

'If I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world, tight
screwed down and soldered in my coffin, rotting in the dark and
filthy ditch that drags its slime along beneath the foundations of
this prison, I could not be more forgotten or unheeded than I am here.
DICKENS-1837-1,564.511

I am a dead man - dead to society, without the pity they bestow on those
whose souls have passed to judgment.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.512

Friends to see <font> me!  <$$font> DICKENS-1837-1,564.513

My God!  I have sunk from the prime of life into old age in this place ,
DICKENS-1837-1,564.514

and there is not one to raise his hand above my bed, when I lie dead
upon it, and say,"It is a blessing he is gone! "'DICKENS-1837-1,564.515

The excitement, which had cast an unwonted light over the man's face
while he spoke, subsided as he concluded; DICKENS-1837-1,564.516

and, pressing his withered hands together in a hasty and disordered
manner, he shuffled from the room.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.517

'Rides rather rusty,'said Mr Roker, with a smile.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.518

'Ah!  $they $'re {TEXT:they're} like the elephants; DICKENS-1837-1,564.519

they feel it now and then, DICKENS-1837-1,564.520

and it makes'em wild! 'DICKENS-1837-1,564.521

Having made this deeply-sympathizing remark, Mr Roker entered upon
his arrangements with such expedition, that in a short time the room
was furnished with a carpet, six chairs, a table, a sofa bedstead,
a tea-kettle, and various small <font> et ceteras <$$font>, on hire,
at the very reasonable rate of seven-and-twenty shillings and sixpence
per week.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.522

'Now, is there anything more we can do for you? 'inquired Mr Roker ,
looking round with great satisfaction, and gaily chinking the first
week's hire in his closed fist.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.523

'Why, yes,'said Mr Pickwick, who had been musing deeply for some time.
DICKENS-1837-1,564.524

'Are there any people here who run on errands, and so forth?
'DICKENS-1837-1,564.525

'Outside, do you mean? 'inquired Mr Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.526

'Yes; I mean who are able to go outside.  DICKENS-1837-1,564.527

Not prisoners. 'DICKENS-1837-1,564.528

<P_565>

'Yes, there is,'said Roker.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.530

'$There $'s {TEXT:There's} an unfortunate devil, who has got a friend on
the poor side, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} glad to do anything of that sort.
DICKENS-1837-1,565.531

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} been running odd jobs, and that, for the last
two months.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.532

Shall I send him? 'DICKENS-1837-1,565.533

'If you please,'rejoined Mr Pickwick.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.534

'Stay; DICKENS-1837-1,565.535

- no.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.536

The poor side, you say.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.537

I should like to see it; DICKENS-1837-1,565.538

- $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go to him myself. 'DICKENS-1837-1,565.539

The poor side of a debtor's prison is, as its name imports, that in
which the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined.
DICKENS-1837-1,565.540

A prisoner having declared upon the poor side, pays neither rent nor
chummage.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.541

His fees, upon entering and leaving the gaol, are reduced in amount,
DICKENS-1837-1,565.542

and he becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of food;
to provide which, a few charitable persons have, from time to time,
left trifling legacies in their wills.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.543

Most of our readers will remember, that, until within a very few years
past, there was a kind of iron cage in the wall of the Fleet Prison,
within which was posted some man of hungry looks, who, from time
to time, rattled a money-box, and exclaimed, in a mournful voice,'
Pray, remember the poor debtors; pray, remember the poor debtors.
'DICKENS-1837-1,565.544

The receipts of this box, when there were any, were divided among the
poor prisoners, DICKENS-1837-1,565.545

and the men on the poor side relieved each other in this degrading office.
DICKENS-1837-1,565.546

Although this custom has been abolished, and the cage is now boarded up ,
the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons remains
the same.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.547

We no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison gates to the charity
and compassion of the passers by; DICKENS-1837-1,565.548

but we still leave unblotted in the leaves of our statute book, for the
reverence and admiration of succeeding ages, the just and wholesome law
which declares that the sturdy felon shall be fed and clothed, and that
the penniless debtor shall be left to die of starvation and nakedness.
DICKENS-1837-1,565.549

This is no fiction.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.550

Not a week passes over our heads but, in every one of our prisons for
debt, some of these men must inevitably expire in the slow agonies
of want, if they were not relieved by their fellow-prisoners.
DICKENS-1837-1,565.551

Turning these things in his mind, as he mounted the narrow staircase
at the foot of which Roker had left him, Mr Pickwick gradually worked
himself to the boiling-over point; DICKENS-1837-1,565.552

and so excited was he with his reflections on this subject, that he had
burst into the room to which he had been directed, before he had any
distinct recollection either of the place in which he was, or of the
object of his visit.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.553

The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once;
DICKENS-1837-1,565.554

but he had no sooner cast his eyes on the figure of a man who was brooding
over the dusty fire, than, letting his hat fall on the floor, he stood
perfectly fixed and immoveable with astonishment.  DICKENS-1837-1,565.555

Yes, in tattered garments, and without a coat; his common calico
shirt <P_566> yellow and in rags; his hair hanging over his face;
his features changed with suffering, and pinched with famine, - there
sat Mr Alfred Jingle; his head resting upon his hand, his eyes fixed
upon the fire, and his whole appearance denoting misery and dejection!
DICKENS-1837-1,566.556

Near him, leaning listlessly against the wall, stood a strong-built
countryman, flicking with a worn-out hunting-whip the top-boot that
adorned his right foot: his left being thrust into an old slipper.
DICKENS-1837-1,566.557

Horses, dogs, and drink had brought him there pell-mell.
DICKENS-1837-1,566.558

There was a rusty spur on the solitary boot, which he occasionally jerked
into the empty air, at the same time giving the boot a smart blow, and
muttering some of the sounds by which a sportsman encourages his horse.
DICKENS-1837-1,566.559

He was riding, in imagination, some desperate steeple-chace at that
moment.  DICKENS-1837-1,566.560

Poor wretch!  he never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly
stud, with half the speed at which he had torn along the course that
ended in the Fleet.  DICKENS-1837-1,566.561

On the opposite side of the room an old man was seated on a small
wooden box, with his eyes rivetted on the floor, and his face
settled into an expression of the deepest and most hopeless despair.
DICKENS-1837-1,566.562
