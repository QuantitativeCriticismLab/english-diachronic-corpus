Act II.  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.3

Scene I.  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.4

<$$heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Simon <font>'s House <$$font>.  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.6

<font> Enter Lady <$$font> Raffler, <font> and Mrs. <$$font>
Raffler.  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.7

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Never tell me, Sister, it is
notorious that a Woman of my Virtue and Discretion, and Prudence, shou'd
be eternally tormented with the Suspicions of a jealous-pated Husband.
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.8

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I own it, FIELDING1-1735-2,15.9

but I only propose to you the best Method to quiet them.
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.10

You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} alter his Nature, FIELDING1-1735-2,15.11

and if you wou'd condescend to flatter it a little, you wou'd make your
Life much easier.  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.12

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I flatter it!
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.13

I assure you, I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't}.  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.14

If my Virtue be not clear enough of $itself {TEXT:it_self}, I shall use
no Art to make it so - FIELDING1-1735-2,15.15

must I give a Husband an Account of all my Words and Actions?
FIELDING1-1735-2,15.16

must I satisfy his groundless Fears?  FIELDING1-1735-2,15.17

I am no such poor spirited Wretch; FIELDING1-1735-2,15.18

and I solemnly declare, if I knew any one <P_16> thing that wou'd make
him more jealous, than another, I wou'd do it.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.19

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Then you wou'd do wrong, my Dear
and only revenge your Husband's Jealousy on $yourself {TEXT:your_self}.
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.20

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sister, Sister, $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} preach up any of your Maxims to me.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.21

If the Colonel was of Sir <font> Simon <$$font>'s Temper, you wou'd lead
a worse Life than I do.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.22

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Indeed, you are mistaken;
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.23

if my Husband was as jealous, and as cunning as the Devil, I wou'd engage
to make an arrant Ass of him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.24

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> You wou'd make another sort of
a Beast of him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.25

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} tell
you that.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.26

But if I shou'd, he had better be so, than suspect it -
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.27

his Horns wou'd hurt him less on his Forehead than in his Eyes.
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.28

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I wonder you can talk such stuff
to me, FIELDING1-1735-2,16.29

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} bear to hear it, FIELDING1-1735-2,16.30

the very Name of a Whore makes me swoon; FIELDING1-1735-2,16.31

if any Set of Words cou'd ever raise the Devil, that single one wou'd
do more than all.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.32

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Dear Sister, $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} be so outrageously virtuous.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.33

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> It wou'd be well for you,
if the Colonel had a little of Sir <font> Simon <$$font>'s Temper.
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.34

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help telling you there are some Actions of your
Life, which I am far from approving.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.35

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Come, $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
be censorious.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.36

I never refuse giving my Husband an Account of any of my Actions, when
he desires it - FIELDING1-1735-2,16.37

and that is more than you can say.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.38

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> My Actions give an Account of
themselves, FIELDING1-1735-2,16.39

I am not afraid of the World's looking into'em.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.40

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Take my Word for it, Child,
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.41

pure Nature $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} do, FIELDING1-1735-2,16.42

the World will easily see your Faults, FIELDING1-1735-2,16.43

but your Virtues must be shewn artfully, FIELDING1-1735-2,16.44

or they will be discover'd.  FIELDING1-1735-2,16.45

Art goes beyond Nature: FIELDING1-1735-2,16.46

and a Woman who has only Virtue in her Face, will pass much
better thro'the World, then she who has it only in her Heart.
FIELDING1-1735-2,16.47

<P_17> La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
know what you mean, Madam, FIELDING1-1735-2,17.48

I am sure my Conduct has been always careful of Appearances;
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.49

but as for the Suspicions of my Husband, I despise; and neither
can nor will give $myself {TEXT:my_self} any Trouble about'em.
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.50

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Soh!  here he comes,
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.51

and I suppose we shall have the usual Dialogue.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.52

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.53

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Your Servant, Ladies!
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.54

Why you are at home early to Day.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.55

What, cou'd you find no Diversions in Town?  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.56

Is there no Opera-Rehearsal, no Auctions, no Mall?  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.57

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> No, none: FIELDING1-1735-2,17.58

Besides, my Sister had a mind to be at home.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.59

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> You need not have said that, my Dear,
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.60

I shou'd not have suspected you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.61

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I think, I seldom give you Reason
of suspecting my Fondness for my own House.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.62

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> No, nor of any thing else.
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.63

I am not jealous of you, my Dear.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.64

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> It wou'd give me no Uneasiness,
if you was.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.65

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I am not jealous even of Captain <font>
Spark.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,17.66

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Captain <font> Spark!  <$$font>
who is he?  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.67

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Tho'he is a very pretty Gentleman,
and is very agreeable Company.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.68

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I long to see him mightily.
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.69

$Wo $n't {TEXT:Won't} you invite him hither, my Dear?
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.70

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why shou'd I invite him, when you can
meet him at an Auction as well?  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.71

- Besides, it seems, he is not proper Company for me,
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.72

or you would not have shuffled him away yesterday, when I came.
FIELDING1-1735-2,17.73

You need not have taken such Care to hide him, FIELDING1-1735-2,17.74

I shou'd not have been jealous of him, my Dear.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.75

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> This must be some strange
Chimera of his own: FIELDING1-1735-2,17.76

no such Person was with us.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.77

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,17.78

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> No, my Dear, I know you wou'd not,
tho'he is a very pretty Fellow.  FIELDING1-1735-2,17.79

<P_18> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> The Devil take all such pretty
Fellows!  With all my Heart and Soul.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.80

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.81

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you know,
Sister, he is the most witty, most entertaining Creature in the World?
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.82

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Think whom so?
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.83

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh, the Captain, - Captain, -
$what $'s {TEXT:what's} his $Name?  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.84

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Captain <font> Spark, <$$font> Madam.
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.85

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} assist you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.86

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ay, Captain <font> Spark.
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.87

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I know no Captain <font> Spark,
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.88

nor was any such Person with us yesterday.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.89

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} believe her,
my Dear.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.90

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> No, my Dear, I shall not,
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.91

I assure you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.92

But do you think this Right, my Dear?  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.93

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> What, Right?
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.94

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why being particular with an idle,
rakehelly young Fellow.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.95

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sir <font> Simon <$$font>
, I shall not have my Company prescrib'd to me by any one.
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.96

I will keep what company I please, FIELDING1-1735-2,18.97

I shall answer to the World for my Actions.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.98

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes, Madam, I am to answer to the World
for your Actions too - FIELDING1-1735-2,18.99

I am most concern'd to see that you act right, since I must bear
the greater Part of the Shame, if you $do $n't {TEXT:don't}.
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.100

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sir, this is a Usage I $can $n't
{TEXT:can't} bear, FIELDING1-1735-2,18.101

nor I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} bear!  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.102

trouble not me with your base, groundless Suspicions:
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.103

I believe the whole World is sensible how unworthy you are of a Woman
of my Virtue; FIELDING1-1735-2,18.104

But, henceforth, when ever any of these Chimeras are rais'd in your Head ,
I shall leave you to lay them at your Leisure.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.105

<bracket> <$$font> Exit.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.106

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Is not this intolerable?
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.107

Is not this insufferable!  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.108

This is the comfortable State that a Man is wish'd Joy of by his Friends
: FIELDING1-1735-2,18.109

And yet no man wishes a Man Joy of being Condemn'd or of getting the
Plague.  FIELDING1-1735-2,18.110

But when a Man is marry'd, Give you Joy, Sir, cries one Fool,
FIELDING1-1735-2,18.111

I wish you Joy, says another; FIELDING1-1735-2,18.112

and thus the Wretch is usher'd into the Gallies, with the same Triumph
as he cou'd be exalted with to the Empire of the Great <font> Mogul.
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,18.113

<P_19> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> You $yourself
{TEXT:your_self} make it so, Brother: FIELDING1-1735-2,19.114

if you had less Jealousy in your Temper, or Lady <font> Raffler <$$font>
, more Complaisance, you might be very happy - FIELDING1-1735-2,19.115

You torment $yourself {TEXT:your_self} with groundless Fears,
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.116

and she depends on her own Innocence, FIELDING1-1735-2,19.117

and will not quiet them.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.118

This was the Case just now: FIELDING1-1735-2,19.119

for whatever put this Captain <font> Spark <$$font> into your Head
, I will take my Oath, she spoke to no such Man at the Auction.
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.120

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> You are a trusty Confident, I find -
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.121

but I had it from his own Mouth.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.122

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What had you from his own Mouth?
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.123

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What!  why that my Wife was a tall Woman.
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.124

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  a very good Reason
to be jealous indeed.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.125

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes, Madam, and that she was a fair Woman.
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.126

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Well, and - Ha, ha, ha!
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.127

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Look ye, Sister, if he had told me this
at first, I shou'd not have regarded it: FIELDING1-1735-2,19.128

but I pumpt it out of him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.129

He is a very close Fellow, and proper to be trusted with a Secret,
I can tell you; FIELDING1-1735-2,19.130

for he told me just the contrary; FIELDING1-1735-2,19.131

but Truth will out, Sister: FIELDING1-1735-2,19.132

besides, did you not hear my Wife confess it?  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.133

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> That was only in Revenge,
to plague you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.134

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> A very charitable good sort of Lady,
truly.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.135

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I wish she was of my
Temper, Brother, and wou'd give you Satisfaction in every thing -
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.136

For my part, I own, if I was your Wife, your Jealousy would give me no
Pain, FIELDING1-1735-2,19.137

and I should take a Pleasure in quieting it: FIELDING1-1735-2,19.138

I shou'd never be uneasy at your enquiring into any of my Actions -
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.139

I shou'd rather take it for a Proof of your Love, and be the fonder of
you for it.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.140

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes, Madam, but I do not desire my Wife,
shou'd be like you, neither.  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.141

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Why so, Brother?
FIELDING1-1735-2,19.142

What do you dislike in me?  FIELDING1-1735-2,19.143

<P_20> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Truly, Madam, that Rendezvous of
Fellows you continually keep at your House, and which, if your Husband
was of my Mind - Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> He wou'd be
Jealous of, I suppose.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.144

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Particularly, that tall Fellow, who
breakfasts here, dines here, sups here, and I believe lies here, or will
lie here very shortly.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.145

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Hold, Brother,
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.146

I desire you wou'd not grow scurrilous; FIELDING1-1735-2,20.147

no wonder, my Sister $can $n't {TEXT:can't} bear with this cursed Temper
of yours.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.148

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What can a marry'd Woman mean by an
Intimacy with any other but her Husband?  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.149

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> $What $'s {TEXT:What's} that
to you, Brother?  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.150

who made you the Inquisitor of my Actions?  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.151

Do you think to call me to an Account, as you do your Wife?
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.152

Oh!  if I was marry'd to such a jealous - If I did not give him enough
of his Jealousy in one Week, if I did not make him heartily weary on't -
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.153

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh rare!  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.154

this is the Woman that wou'd take a Pleasure in satisfying her Husband's
Doubts.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.155

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Look ye, Sir <font> Simon
<$$font>, FIELDING1-1735-2,20.156

your Temper is so intolerable, that you are the By-word of every one;
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.157

the whole Town compassionates my Sister's Case, FIELDING1-1735-2,20.158

and if I was she, if a virtuous Woman cou'd not content you, you shou'd
have your Content another way - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.159

If you wou'd have an Account of every thing I did, I wou'd do something
worth giving you an Account of.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.160

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I believe it, FIELDING1-1735-2,20.161

I easily believe it.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.162

It is very plain, who is my Wife's Counsellor - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.163

But I shall take care to get some better Advice; FIELDING1-1735-2,20.164

for I will not be a Cuckold if I can help it, Madam.
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.165

<font> Enter <$$font> Clarinda.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.166

<font> Cla. <$$font> $There $'s {TEXT:There's} my poor Lady <font>
Raffler <$$font> within in the most terrible way - FIELDING1-1735-2,20.167

She has taken a whole Bottle of Hartshorn to keep up her Spirits.
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.168

It has thrown me into the Vapours, to see her in such a Condition,
FIELDING1-1735-2,20.169

and she $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} tell me $what $'s {TEXT:what's} the matter
with her.  FIELDING1-1735-2,20.170

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Can you have liv'd a Fortnight
in the <P_21> House, and want to know it?  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.171

Sir <font> Simon <$$font> has abus'd her in the most barbarous manner.
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.172

You are a wicked Man.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.173

<font> Cla. <$$font> I am sure she is one of the best Women in
the World.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.174

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Any one but a Brute might be
happy with such a Wife.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.175

<font> Cla. <$$font> He that $can $n't {TEXT:can't}, I am sure
can be happy with no Woman.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.176

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh!  that I had but a jealous
Husband for one Month.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.177

<font> Cla. <$$font> Heav'n forbid, I shou'd ever have one.
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.178

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> So the Enemy is reinforc'd,
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.179

and Bravery can hold out no longer.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.180

<font> Cla. <$$font> Dear Uncle, you shall go and comfort her,
and ask her Pardon.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.181

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> She is too good, if she forgives
such base Suspicions.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.182

<font> Cla. <$$font> I am sure she never gave you any Reason
for them.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.183

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} believe, she wou'd do any thing to bring her
Conduct into Question for the World.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.184

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> She is too cautious.
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.185

If I was in her Case, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} make the House too hot for him.
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.186

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> So it is already.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.187

$Who $'s {TEXT:Who's} there?  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.188

bring my Chariot this Instant, FIELDING1-1735-2,21.189

or if that be not ready, get me a Chair, FIELDING1-1735-2,21.190

get me any thing, that will convey me away.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.191

<font> Enter Servant.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,21.192

<font> Serv. <$$font> Madam, Mr. <font> Gaylove <$$font>
desires to know if you are at Home.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.193

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Yes, I shall be glad to see him.
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.194

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Heav'n be prais'd, FIELDING1-1735-2,21.195

my Wife is not in a Condition to see Company.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.196

<bracket> <font> Exit.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,21.197

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> $Here $'s {TEXT:Here's}
a Picture of Matrimony for you, dear <font> Clarinda <$$font>;
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.198

what say you now to a Coach and Six with such a Husband?
FIELDING1-1735-2,21.199

<font> Cla. <$$font> That I had rather walk on Foot all the Days
of my Life.  FIELDING1-1735-2,21.200

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What Difference is there between
<P_22> Mr. <font> Gaylove's <$$font> Temper, and your Uncle's!
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.201

how happy wou'd a Woman be with him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.202

<font> Cla. <$$font> I am not sure of that -
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.203

Men often appear before Marriage different Creatures from what they are
after it - FIELDING1-1735-2,22.204

Besides, there is something in him so - something so - In short, something
in him I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like, FIELDING1-1735-2,22.205

and of all Women in the World, I shall never envy Mrs. <font>
Gaylove.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,22.206

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> $That $'s {TEXT:That's} a Lye,
I am sure FIELDING1-1735-2,22.207

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> FIELDING1-1735-2,22.208

Nay, the Man is agreeable enough, FIELDING1-1735-2,22.209

he is genteel.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.210

<font> Cla. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think so.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.211

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> He has a great deal of Wit.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.212

<font> Cla. <$$font> Then he has Wisdom enough to keep it to
himself.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.213

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> And the best-natur'd Creature
in the World.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.214

<font> Cla. <$$font> It is very good-natur'd in you to think
him so.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.215

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  Indeed and so
it wou'd.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.216

For I have been only telling you the Opinion of the World.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.217

In my own, he has none of these Qualities: FIELDING1-1735-2,22.218

And I wonder how the World came ever to give them to him.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.219

<font> Cla. <$$font> So do I, if he does not deserve them;
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.220

for the World seldom errs on that side the Question.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.221

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> And yet it does in him.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.222

For to me, he is the most agreeable Creature on Earth.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.223

<font> Cla. <$$font> Well, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be of your
Opinion - FIELDING1-1735-2,22.224

there is somewhat in his Countenance when he smiles, so extremely good
humour'd; FIELDING1-1735-2,22.225

I love dearly to see him smile, FIELDING1-1735-2,22.226

and you know $he $'s {TEXT:he's} always a smiling -
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.227

and his Eyes laugh so comically, FIELDING1-1735-2,22.228

and have so much Sweetness in them.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.229

Then he is the most entertaining Creature upon Earth,
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.230

and I have heard some very good-natur'd Actions of his too.
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.231

The World, I dare swear does not think one whit better of him than
he deserves.  FIELDING1-1735-2,22.232

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh, say you so, Madam?
FIELDING1-1735-2,22.233

<P_23> <font> Enter <$$font> Gaylove <font> and <$$font> Mondish.
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.234

Oh!  here he is - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.235

Are you there too?  FIELDING1-1735-2,23.236

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Ladies, your Servant - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.237

To find Mrs. <font> Raffler <$$font> at Home, and without Company
at this high visiting Season, is so surprising - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.238

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Lard, I suppose you think us
like those Country Ladies you have lately convers'd with, who never
owe a Visit at the Weeks-End to any of their Husband's Tenant's Wives -
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.239

Do you think we have nothing else to do in this sweet Town, but to ride
about the Streets, to see if the Knockers of the People's Doors are fast
- FIELDING1-1735-2,23.240

Indeed you have here and there a Country-Gentlewoman <paren> her
Husband being sent up to Parliament for the Sake of his Country, and
the Destruction of his Family <$$paren> who drives regularly round the
Town to see the Streets, and her Acquaintance and Relations, that she
may know when she may be sure of meeting some one to curtsie to at the
Drawing-Room.  And once a Week very charitably gives her Horses Rest at
the Expence of her Wax-Candles; when she sits in her own Dining-Room,
Chair-Woman of a Committee of Fools, to criticize on Fashions, and
register the Weather.  FIELDING1-1735-2,23.241

<font> Gay.  <$$font> But, I think, it is pity so good a Custom is
left off; if it were only for the better Propagation of Scandal.
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.242

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> What signifies Scandal , when no
one is asham'd of doing what they have a mind to?  FIELDING1-1735-2,23.243

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Yes, there is some Pleasure in spreading it,
when it is not true.  FIELDING1-1735-2,23.244

For tho'no one is asham'd of doing what they have a mind to, they
may be asham'd of being suppos'd to do what they have no mind to.
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.245

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I know very few People who are
asham'd of any thing.  FIELDING1-1735-2,23.246

<font> Mon. <$$font> I believe, Madam, none of your Acquaintance
have any Reason for that Passion.  FIELDING1-1735-2,23.247

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Are you sure of that?
FIELDING1-1735-2,23.248

<font> Mon. <$$font> None who have at present that Honour at
least - FIELDING1-1735-2,23.249

For I have that good Opinion of you, that <P_24> such a Discovery wou'd
soon banish them from it.  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.250

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> That, I believe, you have seen
a very late instance of.  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.251

<font> Cla. <$$font> Well, since you are so sollicitous about
the Song, if you will go with me to the Spinet, you shall hear it.
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.252

My playing, Madam, I am sure, is not worth your hearing.
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.253

But since this Creature will not let me be at quiet -
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.254

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Lard, Child, I believe you do
not want so much Entreaty.  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.255

I think one can never be at quiet for you, and your Musick.
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.256

<font> Cla. <$$font> Madam, I ask your Pardon.
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.257

Come, Mr. <font> Gaylove.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,24.258

<bracket> <font> Exeunt.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,24.259

<font> Mon. <$$font> I receiv'd a Letter from you this Morning,
Madam, but of a Nature so different from some I have had from you, that
I cou'd wish your Hand had been counterfeited.  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.260

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> To save you the Trouble of long
Speech, I sent you a Letter, and the last I ever intend to send you;
since I find it has not the Effect, I desir'd, which was to prevent my
ever seeing your Face again.  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.261

<font> Mon. <$$font> So cruel a Banishment, so sudden,
and so unexpected, ought surely to have some Reasons given for it.
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.262

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ask your own Heart,
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.263

that can suggest'em to you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.264

<font> Mon. <$$font> My Heart is conscious of no other, than what
is too often a Reason to your Sex, for exercising all manner of Tyranny
over us: Too much Fondness - FIELDING1-1735-2,24.265

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Fondness!  Impudence!
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.266

to pretend Fondness to a Woman, after a Week's Neglect -
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.267

Did I not meet you at an Assembly, where you made me a Bow as distant
as if we had been scarce acquainted, or rather, as if we were weary of
our Acquaintance?  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.268

<font> Mon. <$$font> Was not that hundred-eyed Monster of Jealousy
, Sir <font> Simon <$$font>, with you?  FIELDING1-1735-2,24.269

Do you object my Care of your Reputation to want of Fondness?
FIELDING1-1735-2,24.270

<P_25> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> The old Excuse for
Indifference.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.271

I wonder Men have not contriv'd to make it Scandalous for their
Wives to be seen with'em, that they might have an Excuse to them too:
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.272

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} likely indeed that you shou'd have more care of my
Reputation than I myself: FIELDING1-1735-2,25.273

It was not the Jealousy of my Husband, but my Rival you was aware of;
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.274

and yet you was not so tender of her Reputation, but that I discover'd
her.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.275

<font> Mon. <$$font> Excellent Justice!  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.276

For since I am to be punish'd for your Falsehood, it is but just I shou'd
be convicted of it.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.277

My Sweet!  what wou'd I give to believe what you are endeavouring to
persuade me - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.278

Come, FIELDING1-1735-2,25.279

I will assist you with all my force of Credulity; FIELDING1-1735-2,25.280

for was your Opinion of my Falshood real, I would give you such convincing
Proofs to the Contrary - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.281

But your Love to another, is no more a Secret to me, than it is that I
owe to that your Slights, your Letter, and your cruel, unjust Accusation.
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.282

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Insupportable Insolence!
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.283

A Husband may plead a Title to be Jealous; FIELDING1-1735-2,25.284

our Love is his Due - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.285

But a Wretch who owes his Happiness to our free Gift -
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.286

<font> Mon. <$$font> Faith, I think otherwise.
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.287

Love to an Husband is a Tradesman's Debt, FIELDING1-1735-2,25.288

the Law gives him the Security of your Person for it;
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.289

but Love to a Gallant is a Debt of Honour, which every Gentlewoman is
oblig'd to pay - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.290

It wou'd be a Treasure indeed finely bestow'd on such a Husband as yours.
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.291

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I am henceforth resolv'd to
give it to no other.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.292

I am so much oblig'd to his good Opinion, I shou'd hate myself if I did
not try to deserve it - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.293

and by thinking me honest he shall keep me so.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.294

<font> Mon. <$$font> He must know less than I, who is so impos'd
on.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.295

But you shall not keep my Rival a Secret from me, FIELDING1-1735-2,25.296

be assur'd you shall not - FIELDING1-1735-2,25.297

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} haunt you with that constant Assiduity,
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.298

you shall not speak to a Man without my Knowledge -
FIELDING1-1735-2,25.299

You shall find that the Jealousy of twenty Husbands is not equal to that
of one abus'd Gallant.  FIELDING1-1735-2,25.300

<P_26> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Villain!  was it not
you that ruin'd me that deceiv'd me, that robb'd me of my Virtue?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.301

<font> Mon. <$$font> How have I robb'd you?  How deceiv'd you
{COM:sic} FIELDING1-1735-2,26.302

Have I not paid you the Price of your Virtue, Eternal Constancy?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.303

Have I not met your Passion still with fresh Desires?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.304

Has not each stolen Meeting been Scene of Joy, which eager Bridegrooms
might envy {COM:sic_missing_punctuation} FIELDING1-1735-2,26.305

What have I done to disoblige you; FIELDING1-1735-2,26.306

or what has another done to oblige you more?  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.307

Have I been outbid in Fondness?  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.308

Has some fresh Lover burnt with warme {COM:sic} Passion?
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.309

Has some Beau drest himself into your Heart or some Wit talk'd himself
into it?  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.310

Be generous FIELDING1-1735-2,26.311

and confess what has ruin'd me in that dear Bosom FIELDING1-1735-2,26.312

and do not cruelly throw it on a poor harmless Husband.
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.313

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Good-manners shou'd oblige you
to mention him with more Civility to me.  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.314

<font> Mon. <$$font> And after what has pass'd between us,
I think you shou'd mention him to me with less.  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.315

Besides, I think you have sometimes been of my Opinion.
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.316

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Women, you know, are subject
to Change FIELDING1-1735-2,26.317

and I may think better of him, as well as worse of you.
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.318

<font> Mon. <$$font> This is trifling with my Passion, the
cruellest Insult you can put upon it - FIELDING1-1735-2,26.319

But I will find out my Rival, FIELDING1-1735-2,26.320

and will be reveng'd.  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.321

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Reveng'd!  Ha, ha!
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.322

<font> Enter Colonel <$$font> Raffler.  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.323

<font> Mon. <$$font> Death and Torments!  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.324

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Heyday!  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.325

What are they acting a Tragedy?  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.326

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> And how will you be reveng'd,
sweet Sir, if you shou'd find him out - FIELDING1-1735-2,26.327

or why shou'd you desire it?  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.328

The Man acts like a Man, FIELDING1-1735-2,26.329

and does by you, as you have done by another.  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.330

<font> Mon. <$$font> This Usage wou'd justify any thing.
FIELDING1-1735-2,26.331

My own Honour secures me, Madam.  FIELDING1-1735-2,26.332

<P_27> Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I hope you wou'd not
tell my Husband - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.333

but he wou'd not believe it if you did.  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.334

<font> Mon. <$$font> Hark ye, Madam, the Town will -
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.335

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Hold, hold,
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.336

I must interpose - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.337

If you will Quarrel let it be at a distance - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.338

What will I not believe?  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.339

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you what I believe; that you are in the wrong.
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.340

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ay, ay, you will take his Part,
to be sure.  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.341

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Mr. <font> Mondish
<$$font> is a Friend of mine, FIELDING1-1735-2,27.342

and it is strange that you are eternally Quarrelling with all my Friends.
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.343

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I desire then, Sir, you wou'd
keep your Friends to yourself, FIELDING1-1735-2,27.344

for I shall not endure their Impertinence: FIELDING1-1735-2,27.345

So $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} leave you together - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.346

But I must tell your Friend one thing before I go, that I desire I may
never see his Face again - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.347

<bracket> <font> Exit.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,27.348

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> All this a Man must bear that

<font> Mon. <$$font> Ay, and a great deal more than this too.
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.350

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Why, it is true -
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.351

and yet have a good Wife - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.352

I have the best Wife in the World, FIELDING1-1735-2,27.353

but Women have Humours.  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.354

<font> Mon. <$$font> Pox take their Humours!
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.355

Let their Husbands bear'em.  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.356

Must we pay the Price of another's Folly?  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.357

- In short, Colonel, I am the most unfit Person in the World, for that
gentle Office you have assign'd me, of entertaining your Lady in your
Absence.  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.358

Besides, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you a Secret - FIELDING1-1735-2,27.359

It is impossible to be very intimate and well with a Woman, without
making Love to her.  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.360

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Well; and why $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} you make Love to her?  Ha, ha!  make Love to her, indeed!
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.361

$She $'d {TEXT:She'd} Love you, I believe, FIELDING1-1735-2,27.362

$she $'d {TEXT:she'd} give you enough of making Love.
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.363

<font> Mon. <$$font> Why do you think no one has made Love to
her then?  FIELDING1-1735-2,27.364

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I think nothing,
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.365

I am sure no one ever has, FIELDING1-1735-2,27.366

for I am sure if they had, she wou'd have told me.
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.367

Perhaps $that $'s {TEXT:that's} a Secret you $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
know, that she never kept one Secret from me in her Life.
FIELDING1-1735-2,27.368

I am certain, <P_28> if it were possible for her to make me a Cuckold
she wou'd tell me on't; FIELDING1-1735-2,28.369

and it is an excellent thing to have such a Security, that one is not
one - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.370

Dear <font> Mondish <$$font> do - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.371

make Love to my Wife, FIELDING1-1735-2,28.372

let me beseech you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.373

<font> Mon. <$$font> Excuse me, dear Colonel -
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.374

but $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} do as well, FIELDING1-1735-2,28.375

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} recommend one to you that shall.
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.376

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ay, who is he?
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.377

<font> Mon. <$$font> What think you of Mr. <font> Gaylove
<$$font>?  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.378

Beside, I believe it will please your Lady better.
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.379

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  I cou'd die with
laughing.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.380

Ha!  ha, ha!  this is the Man now that knows the World, and Mankind,
and Womankind.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.381

You have happen'd to name the very Man whom she detests of all Men
breathing.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.382

She told me so this very Morning.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.383

<font> Mon. <$$font> Then I am satisfy'd.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.384

Damnation and Hell!  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.385

Now can I scarce forbear telling this Fellow he is a Cuckold to his Face
- FIELDING1-1735-2,28.386

$'S $death {TEXT:'Sdeath} FIELDING1-1735-2,28.387

$Hark $'e {TEXT:Hark'e}, Colonel, FIELDING1-1735-2,28.390

you have put a very pleasant Conceit into my Head.
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.391

I think I have heard you say, that you have a great Pleasure in seeing
the Disdain your Lady shews to all Mankind - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.392

Now I have the same Pleasure - FIELDING1-1735-2,28.393

Suppose therefore it was possible to work up <font> Gaylove <$$font>
to make his Addresses to her, FIELDING1-1735-2,28.394

and you and I cou'd convey ourselves where we might see her treat him
as he deserves.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.395

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I like it vastly:
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.396

How I shall hug myself all the while, FIELDING1-1735-2,28.397

I know exactly how she will behave to him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.398

I shall certainly die with Pleasure; FIELDING1-1735-2,28.399

let me tell you, my Dear, let me tell you, there is a great deal of
Pride in having a virtuous Wife.  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.400

<font> Mon. <$$font> If Brilliants were not scarce they would
not be valuable: FIELDING1-1735-2,28.401

And Virtue in a Wife perhaps may be valu'd for the same reason.
FIELDING1-1735-2,28.402

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> But do you think he can be
brought to it?  FIELDING1-1735-2,28.403

<font> Mon. <$$font> I warrant him, FIELDING1-1735-2,28.404

he has Vanity enough to be easily persuaded that a Woman may be fond of
him, and <P_29> Gallantry enough not to let her Fondness be thrown away.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.405

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I am charm'd with the
Contrivance.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.406

But he must never know that I knew any thing of the Matter.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.407

I $sha $n't {TEXT:shan't} know how to behave to him if he shou'd.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.408

<font> Mon. <$$font> You may learn from half your Acquaintance.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.409

How many Husbands do we see caressing Men, whose intrigues with
their Wives, they must be blinder than Darkness itself not to see!
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.410

It is a civil Communicative Age we live in, Colonel.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.411

And it is no more a Breach of Friendship to make use of your Wife,
than of your Chariot.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.412

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> It is a devilish Cuckolding Age,
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.413

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} the truth on't, FIELDING1-1735-2,29.414

and Heaven be prais'd $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} out of Fashion.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.415

<font> Mon. <$$font> Ay, $there $'s {TEXT:there's} the Glory -
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.416

Wealth, Power, ev'ry thing is known by Comparison -
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.417

were all Women Virtuous, you wou'd not taste half of your Blessing.
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.418

The Joy, the Pride, the Triumph is to see The Ills a Neighbour
in a Wife endures, And have a Wife as good and chaste as yours.

Act III.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.421

Scene I.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.422

<$$heading>

Scene, <font> A Street <$$font>.  {TEXT:..} FIELDING1-1735-2,29.424

Mondish, Gaylove.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.425

<font> Gay.  <$$font> And art thou really in earnest?
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.426

and art thou perfectly sure, she has this Passion for me?
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.427

<font> Mon. <$$font> Thou art blind thyself FIELDING1-1735-2,29.428

or thou must have discover'd it, FIELDING1-1735-2,29.429

all her Looks, Words, Actions betray it.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.430

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Thou art a nice Observer, <font> George, <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,29.431

and perhaps in this Case, your own Passion may heighten your Suspicions
; FIELDING1-1735-2,29.432

I know thy Temper is inclin'd to Jealousy.  FIELDING1-1735-2,29.433

<P_30>

<font> Mon. <$$font> Far from it; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.435

I never doubt the Affection of a Woman while she is kind,
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.436

nor ever think any more of'em when she grows otherwise.
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.437

Women undoubtedly are Blessing {COM:sic} to us, if we do not, $ourselves
{TEXT:our_selves} make'em otherwise.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.438

I have just Love enough to assist'em in giving me Pleasure, but not to
put it in their power to give me Pain; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.439

and I cou'd with as much Ease see thee in the Arms of Mrs. <font>
Raffler, <font> as of any Woman in Town.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.440

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Wou'd'st thou?  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.441

$She $'s {TEXT:She's} young, handsome, and witty, FIELDING1-1735-2,30.442

and faith!  I cou'd almost as soon wish myself there.
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.443

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} true, I have an honourable Engagement
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.444

but a Man's having settled his whole Estate, shou'd not prevent his
being charitable, <font> George.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,30.445

<font> Mon. <$$font> Especially when what he bestows does not
hurt his Estate.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.446

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Very true; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.447

therefore if I was sure the Lady was in Necessity, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
know how far my Good Nature might carry me, FIELDING1-1735-2,30.448

for the Devil take me if I am not one of the best-natur'd Creatures in
the World.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.449

<font> Mon. <$$font> I think I am acting a very good-natur'd part
too; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.450

a Man is oblig'd in honour to provide for a Cast Mistress,
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.451

but I do more, FIELDING1-1735-2,30.452

I provide for a Mistress who has cast me off.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.453

<font> Gay.  <$$font> I begin to suspect thou hast some Design of making
me an Instrument in your Reconciliation; FIELDING1-1735-2,30.454

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} see how my Addresses can be of any Use to you,
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.455

but if they can, they are at your Service.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.456

<font> Mon. <$$font> I thank you with all my Heart;
FIELDING1-1735-2,30.457

they serve me at least, so far, as to discover whether you are my innocent
Rival, or whether I am to seek for him elsewhere: FIELDING1-1735-2,30.458

besides, if you are really the Person, and $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care to
be charitable, as you call it, by playing Captain <font> Spark <$$font>
with her, you may pique her back again to me.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.459

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.460

<font> Mon. <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} what do'st thou
laugh at?  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.461

<font> Gay.  <$$font> To see so cool a Lover as thou art, who cares for
a Woman no longer than she is kind, take such Pains to get her again,
after she has jilted you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,30.462

<P_31>

<font> Mon. <$$font> Pshaw!  that - I well -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.464

<font> Gay.  <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.465

<font> Mon. <$$font> You are merry, Sir, FIELDING1-1735-2,31.466

- But I wou'd not have you think that I have any Love for her -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.467

She has hurt my Pride; FIELDING1-1735-2,31.468

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} that, and not my Love that I want to cure -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.469

Damn her!  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.470

If I had her but in my Power; cou'd I but triumph over her, I shou'd
have the End of my Desires, FIELDING1-1735-2,31.471

and then, if her Husband, or the Town, or the Devil had her, it wou'd
give me no Pain.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.472

<font> Gay.  <$$font> I dare swear thou wilt use thy Power very gently.
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.473

I shall sup there this Evening, FIELDING1-1735-2,31.474

and if I have an Opportunity with her, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} do thee all
the Service I can, tho'I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} promise to behave exactly
up to the Character of Captain <font> Spark <$$font>, if she shou'd be
very kind.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.475

<font> Mon. <$$font> Well, make use of your Victory as you please.
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.476

<font> Gay <$$font> But $me $thinks {TEXT:methinks} you take a
preposterous Way.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.477

Wou'd it not be better to alarm her with another Mistress?
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.478

<font> Mon. <$$font> That, perhaps, I intend too.
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.479

<font> Gay.  <$$font> I have overstay'd my time with you,
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.480

- besides I see coming for whose Company I have no great Relish -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.481

So, your Servant.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.482

<bracket> <font> Exit.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,31.483

<font> Mon. <$$font> Whom?  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.484

O, Sir <font> Simon.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,31.485

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} avoid him too.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.486

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.487

<font> Sir Sim. <$$font> Mr. <font> Mondish, <$$font>
Mr. <font> Mondish <$$font> - is there anything frightful in me,
that you run away from me?  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.488

$I fancy my Horns are out, and People think I shall butt at'em -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.489

As for that handsome Gentleman, who sneak'd off so prettily, I shall
not go after him, FIELDING1-1735-2,31.490

- and I wish I may have seen the last of him with all my Heart -
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.491

Is he an Acquaintance of yours, pray?  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.492

For I saw you speak to him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.493

<font> Mon. <$$font> Ay, Sir <font> Simon.  <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.494

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I am sorry for it, FIELDING1-1735-2,31.495

I am sorry you keep such Company.  FIELDING1-1735-2,31.496

<font> Mon. <$$font> How so, Sir <font> Simon?
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.497

<$$font> $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a Man of Honour, $I hope.
FIELDING1-1735-2,31.498

<P_32> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh, a Man of very nice Honour, I
dare answer for him, and one who lies with every Man's Wife he comes near.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.499

<font> Mon. <$$font> Indeed I fear he has been guilty of some
small Offences that way.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.500

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Small Offences!  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.501

and yet to break open a House, or rob on the Highway are great Offences.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.502

A Man that robs me of five Shillings is a Rogue, and to be hang'd;
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.503

but he that robs me of my Wife, is a fine Gentleman, and a Man of Honour.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.504

<font> Mon. <$$font> The Laws shou'd be severer on these Occasions.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.505

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> The Laws shou'd give us more Power over
our Wives.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.506

If a Man was to carry his Treasure about openly among Thieves, I believe
the Laws wou'd be very little Security to him.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.507

<font> Mon. <$$font> And as to prevent Robbing they have put
down all Night-houses, and other Places of Rendezvous, so to prevent
Cuckoldom, we shou'd put down all Assemblies, Balls, Operas, Plays,
in short, all the Publick Places.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.508

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Ay, ay, Publick Places, as they call 'em
are intended only to give People an Opportunity of getting acquainted ,
and appointing to meet in Private Places.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.509

<font> Mon. <$$font> An Assembly, Sir <font> Simon, <$$font>
is an Exchange for Cuckoldom, where the Traders meet, and make
their Bargains, and then adjourn to a private Room to sign and seal.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.510

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Mr. <font> Mondish, <$$font>
I know you are my Friend; FIELDING1-1735-2,32.511

there has been a long Acquaintance and Friendship between our Families,
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.512

I shall tell you, therefore, what I wou'd not tell any other Living.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.513

I have not the least Jealousy in my Temper, FIELDING1-1735-2,32.514

but I have a Wife that wou'd make the Devil Jealous -
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.515

Oh, here comes the Man I have been looking after.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.516

<font> Mon. <$$font> Sir <font> Simon, <$$font> your humble
Servant.  FIELDING1-1735-2,32.517

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Nay, but stay a Moment.
FIELDING1-1735-2,32.518

<P_33> <font> Mon. <$$font> I have business of Consequence,
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.519

and $can $n't {TEXT:can't} possibly - FIELDING1-1735-2,33.520

Your humble Servant.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.521

<bracket> <font> Exit.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,33.522

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well, your Servant.
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.523

<font> Enter Captain <$$font> Spark.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.524

What in the Name of Mischief is he reading?  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.525

A Letter from my Wife, I suppose.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.526

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Sir, your most humble Servant -
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.527

I think I had the Honour of seeing you at my Cousin <font> Mondish
<$$font>'s this Morning.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.528

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Yes Sir, and I shou'd be glad to have
the Honour of seeing you hang'd this Afternoon.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.529

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> FIELDING1-1735-2,33.530

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Pray, Sir, $what $'s {TEXT:what's}
a Clock?  because I have an Engagement at Six.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.531

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh, Sir, it wants considerably of that ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.532

but perhaps your Engagement is with a Lady, FIELDING1-1735-2,33.533

and that makes the Time longer.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.534

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Why, faith!  to be sincere with you,
it is; FIELDING1-1735-2,33.535

but I beg you wou'd not mention that to any body; FIELDING1-1735-2,33.536

tho'if you shou'd, as long as you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know her Name,
$there $'s {TEXT:there's} no Reputation hurt.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.537

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I Suppose, Captain, it is she whom you
met at the Auction.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.538

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> How the Devil came you to guess that?
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.539

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well, but I have guess'd right.
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.540

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> I am not oblig'd to tell -
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.541

but this I will tell you, FIELDING1-1735-2,33.542

Sir, you have a very good knack at guessing.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.543

And yet I will shew you her Christian Name, and lay you a Wager you $do
$n't {TEXT:don't} find out her Sirname.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.544

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> <font> Anne, <$$font> the Devil!
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.545

It is not my Wife's Hand, FIELDING1-1735-2,33.546

but it is her Name.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.547

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Hold, Sir, FIELDING1-1735-2,33.548

that is not fair.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.549

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Let me but see the two first Letters of
her Sirname.  FIELDING1-1735-2,33.550

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> To oblige you, you shall -
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.551

but if you shou'd guess afterwards, you are a Man of Honour.
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.552

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Sir, I am satisfy'd.
FIELDING1-1735-2,33.553

- I am the happiest Man in the World - FIELDING1-1735-2,33.554

dear Captain, I give you ten <P_34> thousand Thanks.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.555

You have quieted my Curiosity.  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.556

I thought, by your Description this Morning, you had meant another Lady.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.557

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Whom did you think?
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.558

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Really I thought the Lady's Name was
<font> Raffler <$$font>, whom you describ'd.  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.559

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Mrs. <font> Raffler, <$$font>
indeed, ha, ha!  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.560

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why, do you know Mrs. <font>
Raffler?  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.561

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Know her, Ay, FIELDING1-1735-2,34.562

who the Devil does not know her?  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.563

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What, what, what do you know of her?
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.564

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Pugh, know of her!  ha, ha!
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.565

Lard help you, FIELDING1-1735-2,34.566

know of her indeed - and with a grave face as if you had never heard
any thing of us two.  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.567

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> My Brother is an errant downright Cuckold.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.568

I never was better pleas'd with any News in my Life.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.569

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Is she a Relation of yours, that
you are so anxious?  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.570

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> No, Sir, no, no Relation of mine, upon
my Honour - FIELDING1-1735-2,34.571

I have some Acquaintance with a Lady of her Name, one Lady <font> Raffler.
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.572

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Ay, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} a good
one too.  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.573

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What, do you know my Lady <font> Raffler?
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.574

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Yes, I think I do.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.575

Ha, ha, ha - faith!  I remember that Woman, a very fine Woman;
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.576

nay, $she $'s {TEXT:she's} well enough still, FIELDING1-1735-2,34.577

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help saying I like her better than her Sister.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.578

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I suppose you have had'em both.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.579

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Who I?  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.580

ha, ha, ha!  no, no, neither of'em; FIELDING1-1735-2,34.581

you are the most Suspicious Person, tho'I believe the World has talk'd
pretty freely.  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.582

But, ha, ha!  the World you know is a censorious World,
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.583

and yet Pox take the Women!  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.584

they owe more Discoveries to their own Imprudence.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.585

I never had a Woman fond of me in my Life, that was able to conceal it ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.586

if I had had her, it might have been a Secret for me.
FIELDING1-1735-2,34.587

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well, Sir, it is no Secret, I assure
you - FIELDING1-1735-2,34.588

ten thousand Devils take'em both!  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.589

<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,34.590

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> I defy any one to say he ever heard
me brag of my Amours, FIELDING1-1735-2,34.591

and yet I have had a few.  FIELDING1-1735-2,34.592

<P_35> Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> And you have had Lady <font>
Raffler <$$font> then?  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.593

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> No, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} too much
to own.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.594

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Not at all; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.595

no one is asham'd to own their Amours now - FIELDING1-1735-2,35.596

fine Gentlemen talk of Women of Quality, in the same manner as of their
Laundresses.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.597

Besides it is known already, FIELDING1-1735-2,35.598

you may own it, especially to me; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.599

for it shall go no farther, I assure you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.600

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Well then, in Confidence that you
are a Man of Honour, I will own it to you; FIELDING1-1735-2,35.601

yes, yes, I have, I have had her.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.602

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Wou'd the Devil had had you.
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.603

Now, if I had the Spirit of a Worm, I wou'd beat this Fellow to Death ;
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.604

but I think I have Spirit enough to beat my Wife.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.605

She shall pay for all; and that immediately.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.606

Your Servant.  FIELDING1-1735-2,35.607

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> I hope you $wo $n't
{TEXT:won't} discover a Word, since I place such Confidence in you.
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.608

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Never fear me, Sir -
FIELDING1-1735-2,35.609

I am much beholden to your Confidence, FIELDING1-1735-2,35.610

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> If I had known you had been in
Town sooner, Madam, I shou'd have done $myself {TEXT:my_self} the
Honour before.  FIELDING1-1735-2,41.812

<font> Cla. <$$font> And now, perhaps, this Visit is not to me,
but to the Ladies.  FIELDING1-1735-2,41.813

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Really Madam, these Ladies I have
not the Honour to be acquainted with.  FIELDING1-1735-2,41.814

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Oh, your Servant,
FIELDING1-1735-2,41.815

Brother, I ask your Pardon - FIELDING1-1735-2,41.816

who is convicted now?  FIELDING1-1735-2,41.817

<P_42> La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Unless at an Auction,
Captain; FIELDING1-1735-2,42.818

I have seen you there.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.819

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Madam, you do me too much Honour
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.820

yes, Madam, I have indeed had the Happiness - tho'the Devil take me,
If I know when or where.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.821

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Oh, I thought they wou'd know one another
by and by.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.822

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> I think you laid out a great
deal o'Money that Morning, Captain - FIELDING1-1735-2,42.823

You bid for almost every thing.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.824

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Yes, Madam, I $am $a {TEXT:am'a}
pretty good Customer to'em generally.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.825

Either I have a damn'd shot Memory, FIELDING1-1735-2,42.826

or this Lady wants a good one.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.827

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> I think, Captain; I
ought to be affronted, you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} remember me too,
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.828

for I was at the same Place with my Sister.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.829

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Madam, I ask ten thousand Pardons.
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.830

Your most obedient Servant, Madam.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.831

$Hark $'e {TEXT:Hark'e} Sir FIELDING1-1735-2,42.832

will you be so good as to tell me, what these Ladies Names are,
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.833

for I have positively forgot.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.834

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> I am surpriz'd at that, Sir;
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.835

why, Sir, that is my good Lady, my Lady <font> Raffler <$$font> - for your
Favours to whom, I am very much oblig'd to you; FIELDING1-1735-2,42.836

and the other, Sir, is Mrs. <font> Raffler, <$$font> Wife to that
Gentleman, who is as much oblig'd to you for your Civilities to her.
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.837

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Soh, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} in a fine way,
faith - FIELDING1-1735-2,42.838

Oh curse on my lying Tongue!  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.839

if I get well out of this Amour, I will never have another as long as
I love {COM:sic}.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.840

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Look ye, Sir, as for me, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm}
an honest sober Citizen, FIELDING1-1735-2,42.841

and shall take my Revenge another way FIELDING1-1735-2,42.842

but my Brother here, is a fighting Man, FIELDING1-1735-2,42.843

and will return your Favour as fighting Men generally do return Favours,
by cutting your Throat.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.844

$Hark $'e {TEXT:Hark'e} Brother FIELDING1-1735-2,42.845

you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} deserve it of me, FIELDING1-1735-2,42.846

yet I must let you know that this Gentleman assur'd me to Day, that he
had done you the Favour with your Wife.  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.847

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> With me!  FIELDING1-1735-2,42.848

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> What Favour?
FIELDING1-1735-2,42.849

<P_43>

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> The Favour, the only Favour which fine
Gentlemen do such Sort of People as us; FIELDING1-1735-2,43.851

but be not dejected, Brother, FIELDING1-1735-2,43.852

I am your Fellow-sufferer, FIELDING1-1735-2,43.853

he has had my Wife too, FIELDING1-1735-2,43.854

he confess'd it to my Face.  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.855

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Not I, upon my Soul, Sir -
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.856

a likely thing I shou'd say that I had an Amour with a Woman that I
never saw before, to my Knowledge!  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.857

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> And have you the Assurance to deny to
my face - FIELDING1-1735-2,43.858

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> I think, Sir, your Assurance
is greater, $to assert a thing to my Face, which I never said;
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.859

I $never nam'd either of the Ladies in my Life.  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.860

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What, Sir!  did you not mention
Mrs. <font> Raffler <$$font>'s Name?  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.861

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Mrs. <font> Raffler!  <$$font>
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.862

Oh, then it is out - FIELDING1-1735-2,43.863

What a Confusion had the Mistake of a Name like $to have occasion'd?
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.864

Ladies, I am under the greatest concern, that I shou'd be ev'n the
innocent Occasion of the least Uneasiness to you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.865

But I believe, Sir, I shall $end yours, when I have put $myself
{TEXT:my_self} to the Blush, by confessing that it was only a <font>
Dutch <$$font> Lady of Pleasure, whom I knew in <font> Amsterdam <$$font>
, that caus'd your Jealousy.  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.866

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What!  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.867

and did not you name my Lady <font> Raffler <$$font> too?
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.868

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Yes, sometimes she is call'd
Mrs. <font> Raffler, <$$font> and sometimes my Lady <font> Raffler.
<$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,43.869

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> An impudent Jade!
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.870

ha, ha, ha!  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.871

ay, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} common enough with'em to have several Names and
titles - FIELDING1-1735-2,43.872

Come, come Brother, FIELDING1-1735-2,43.873

all you have to do, is to ask Pardon of the Gentleman, and your Wife
and mine - FIELDING1-1735-2,43.874

Are not you asham'd to put all the Company into this Confusion, because
there is a Woman of the Town, who wears the same Name with your own Wife?
FIELDING1-1735-2,43.875

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> A Man has some Reason for Confusion;
tho'let me tell you, when a Gentleman, who does not know him, tells him
to his Face, that he has lain with a Woman, who wears the same Name with
his Wife.  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.876

And I think he may be excus'd, if he thinks she wears the same Cloaths
too.  FIELDING1-1735-2,43.877

<P_44> Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Sir, I am very sorry,
any thing of $this Nature shou'd happen.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.878

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Oh, Sir, things of this Nature are
unusual with me, FIELDING1-1735-2,44.879

I beg no Apology.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.880

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Please Heav'n!  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.881

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} make a Voyage to <font> Holland <$$font>, and search
all the Bawdy-houses in <font> Amsterdam <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,44.882

but I will find out whether there be such a Woman or no.
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.883

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Come, Brother,
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.884

ask the Gentleman's Pardon - FIELDING1-1735-2,44.885

I am asham'd of you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.886

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Well, Sir, <paren> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
know how to do it <$$paren> FIELDING1-1735-2,44.887

if I have injur'd you, I ask your Pardon; FIELDING1-1735-2,44.888

and yet I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help thinking still, it was my Lady
<font> Raffler <$$font> you mention'd, FIELDING1-1735-2,44.889

and I believe you spoke Truth too.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.890

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> Sir, I can easily forgive
you suspecting me to be the happiest Person upon Earth;
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.891

if you have this Lady's Pardon, you have mine.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.892

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What, is the Rascal making love to her
before my Face?  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.893

But I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} give him an Opportunity of cutting my Throat
before hers; FIELDING1-1735-2,44.894

for I wou'd not willingly give her so much Pleasure.
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.895

<font> Cla. <$$font> I believe, Madam, the Captain will make $a
fourth at Quadrille.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.896

Cap. <font> Spark.  <$$font> You honour me too much, Madam;
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.897

but if you will bear with a very bad Player - FIELDING1-1735-2,44.898

La. <font> Raff. <$$font> Tho'I hate Cards, I will play
with him if it be only to torment my Husband.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.899

Mrs. <font> Raff. <$$font> This is opportune enough -
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.900

I will see'em together, FIELDING1-1735-2,44.901

and shall soon get some one to hold my Cards, while I go to a better
Appointment.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.902

Come, if you will follow me, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} conduct you to the Cards.
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.903

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> FIELDING1-1735-2,44.904

<font> Manent Sir <$$font> Simon, <font> and Colonel <$$font> Raffler.
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.905

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> This is mighty pretty, mighty fine, truly.
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.906

This is a rare Country, and a rare Age we live in where a Man is
oblig'd to put his Horns in his Pocket, whether he will or no.
FIELDING1-1735-2,44.907

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Fye upon you, Brother, fye
upon you.  FIELDING1-1735-2,44.908

For you, who have one of the most virtuous Women in the World to your
Wife, to be thus tormenting <P_45> $yourself {TEXT:your_self} and her
, your Friends and every one, with those groundless Suspicions, such
unheard of Jealousies!  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.909

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Sir, you injure me, if you call me
jealous; FIELDING1-1735-2,45.910

I have not a Grain of Jealousy within me.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.911

I am not indeed so foolishly blind as you are.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.912

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> And you injure me, if you think
I am not jealous; FIELDING1-1735-2,45.913

I am all over Jealousy, FIELDING1-1735-2,45.914

and if there was at the least Occasion to shew it -
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.915

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Occasion!  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.916

why is not your Wife at this very Instant at Cards with a young Fellow?
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.917

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Well, Sir, and is not your Wife
with her?  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.918

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Sore against my Will, I assure you -
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.919

What, I suppose, you are one of those wise Men, who think one Woman is
a Guard upon another - FIELDING1-1735-2,45.920

now, it is my Opinion, that a Plurality of Women only tend to the making
a Plurality of Cuckolds.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.921

Thieves, indeed, discover one another, because the Discoverer often
saves his Life by it - FIELDING1-1735-2,45.922

But Women do not save their Reputations after the same manner,
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.923

and therefore every Woman keeps her Neighbour's secret, in order to have
her own kept.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.924

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Pshaw!  Sir, I $do
$n't {TEXT:don't} rely upon this, nor that, nor t'other,
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.925

I rely upon my Wife's Virtue.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.926

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> Why truly Sir, that is not relying upon
this, nor that, nor t'other, FIELDING1-1735-2,45.927

for it is relying upon nothing at all.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.928

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> How, Sir!  $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
you think my Wife virtuous?  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.929

- Now Sir, to shew you to your Confusion, what an excellent Creature this
is, I gave her leave once to go to a Masquerade, FIELDING1-1735-2,45.930

and follow'd her thither $myself {TEXT:my_self}, where tho'I knew her
Dress, I did not find her, FIELDING1-1735-2,45.931

- and where do you think she was?  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.932

Where do you think this good Creature was?  but at supper in private,
with a poor Female Relation of hers, who keeps a Milliner's Shop at
St. <font> James <$$font>'s.  FIELDING1-1735-2,45.933

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> O Lud!  O Lud!  O Lud!
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.934

- and are you, brother, really wise enough to think she was there -
FIELDING1-1735-2,45.935

or if she was there, do you think she was alone, with this poor Female
Relation?  who is a Relation of mine <P_46> too, I thank Heav'n, and is,
I dare swear, as useful $a Woman as any in the Parish of St. <font>
James <$$font>'s.  FIELDING1-1735-2,46.936

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> Brother, you are -
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.937

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> What am I, Brother?  -
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.938

Col. <font> Raff. <$$font> I can bear this no longer.
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.939

You are - I need not tell you, FIELDING1-1735-2,46.940

you know what you are - FIELDING1-1735-2,46.941

Sir <font> Sim. <$$font> And I know what you are too,
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.942

you are a Cuckold, FIELDING1-1735-2,46.943

and so am I, I dare swear - Notwithstanding this Evasion of the Captain's
, FIELDING1-1735-2,46.944

however, I shall not rest so - FIELDING1-1735-2,46.945

If I am what I think, I will make an ample Discovery of it;
FIELDING1-1735-2,46.946

tho'if I was to find them in one another's Arms, the poor Husband wou'd
always be found in the Wrong.  FIELDING1-1735-2,46.947
