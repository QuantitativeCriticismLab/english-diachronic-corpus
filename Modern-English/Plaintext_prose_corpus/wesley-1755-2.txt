<P_5>

The Nature of Enthusiasm.  WESLEY-1755-2,5.2

Acts xxvi. 24.  WESLEY-1755-2,5.3

<font> And <$$font> Festus <font> said with a loud Voice <$$font>,
Paul <font> Thou art beside thyself.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,5.4

I.  WESLEY-1755-2,5.5

And so say all the World, the Men who know not God, of all that are of
<font> Paul <$$font>'s Religion; of every one who is so a Follower of him,
as he was of Christ.  WESLEY-1755-2,5.6

It is true, there is a Sort of Religion, nay and it is called Christianity
too, which may be practised without any such Imputation, which is
generally allowed <P_6> to be consistent with common Sense.  That is,
a Religion of Form, a Round of outward Duties, performed in a decent
regular Manner.  WESLEY-1755-2,6.7

You may add Orthodoxy thereto, a System of right Opinions; yea, and some
Quantity of Heathen Morality.  WESLEY-1755-2,6.8

And yet not many will pronounce, That <font> much <$$font> Religion <font>
hath made you mad.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,6.9

But if you aim at the Religion of the Heart, if you talk of Righteousness
and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost, then it will not be long before
<font> your <$$font> Sentence is past, WESLEY-1755-2,6.10

<font> thou art beside thyself.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,6.11

II.  WESLEY-1755-2,6.12

And it is no Compliment which the Men of the World pay you herein.
WESLEY-1755-2,6.13

They, for once, mean what they say.  WESLEY-1755-2,6.14

They not only affirm, but cordially believe, That every Man is <font>
beside himself <$$font>, who says, The Love of God is shed abroad in
his Heart, by the Holy Ghost given unto him, and that God has enabled
him to rejoice in Christ, with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.
WESLEY-1755-2,6.15

If a Man is indeed alive to God, and dead to all Things here below;
if he continually sees <P_7> him that is invisible, and accordingly
walks by Faith and not by Sight: then they account it a clear Case;
beyond all Dispute, WESLEY-1755-2,7.16

<font> much <$$font> Religion <font> hath made him mad.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,7.17

III.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.18

It is easy to observe, That the determinate Thing which the World
accounts Madness, is that utter Contempt of all temporal Things, and
steady Pursuit of Things eternal; that divine Conviction of Things not
seen; that rejoicing in the Favour of God; that happy, holy Love of God;
and that Testimony of his Spirit, with our Spirit that we are the Children
of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.19

That is, in Truth, the whole Spirit and Life and Power of the Religion
of Jesus Christ.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.20

IV.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.21

They will however allow, in other Respects, the Man acts and talks like
one in his Senses.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.22

In other Things, he is a reasonable Man: WESLEY-1755-2,7.23

it is in these Instances only his Head is touched.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.24

It is therefore acknowledged, that the Madness under which he labours,
is of a particular Kind.  WESLEY-1755-2,7.25

And <P_8> accordingly they are accustomed to distinguish it by a
particular Name, Enthusiasm.  WESLEY-1755-2,8.26

V.  A Term this, which is exceeding frequently used, which is scarce
ever out of some Men's Mouths.  WESLEY-1755-2,8.27

And yet it is exceedingly rarely understood, even by those who use
it most.  WESLEY-1755-2,8.28

It may be therefore not unacceptable to serious Men, to all who desire
to understand what they speak or hear, if I endeavour to explain the
Meaning of this Term, to shew what <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> is.
WESLEY-1755-2,8.29

It may be an Encouragement to those who are unjustly charged therewith:
WESLEY-1755-2,8.30

and may possibly be of Use, to some who are justly charged with it, at
least to others, who might be so, were they not cautioned against it.
WESLEY-1755-2,8.31

VI.  WESLEY-1755-2,8.32

As to the Word itself, it is generally allowed to be of Greek Extraction.
WESLEY-1755-2,8.33

But whence the Greek Word {COM:greek_omitted}, is derived, none has yet
been able to shew.  WESLEY-1755-2,8.34

<P_9>

Some have endeavoured to derive it from {COM:greek_omitted}, <font>
in God <$$font>, because all <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> has Reference
to him.  WESLEY-1755-2,9.36

But this is quite forced; there being small Resemblance between the Word
derived, and those they strive to derive it from.  WESLEY-1755-2,9.37

Others would derive it from {COM:greek_omitted}, <font> in Sacrifice
<$$font>, because many of the <font> Enthusiasts <$$font> of old, were
affected in the most violent Manner, during the Time of Sacrifice.
WESLEY-1755-2,9.38

Perhaps it is a fictitious Word, invented from the Noise, which some
those made who were so affected.  WESLEY-1755-2,9.39

VII.  WESLEY-1755-2,9.40

It is not improbable, that one Reason why this uncouth Word has been
retained in so many Languages, was because Men were no better agreed,
concerning the {TEXT:the_the} Meaning than concerning the Derivation
of it.  WESLEY-1755-2,9.41

They therefore adopted the Greek Word, because they did not understand
it: WESLEY-1755-2,9.42

they did not translate it into their own Tongues, because they knew
not how to translate it: it having been always a <P_10> Word of a
loose, uncertain Sense, to which no determinate Meaning was affix'd.
WESLEY-1755-2,10.43

VIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,10.44

It is not therefore at all $surprizing {TEXT:surprizng}, that it is
so variously taken at this Day: different Persons understanding it in
different Senses, quite inconsistent with each other.  WESLEY-1755-2,10.45

Some take it in a good Sense, for a divine Impulse or Impression, superior
to all the natural Faculties, and suspending for the Time, either in whole
or in part, both the Reason and the outward Senses.  WESLEY-1755-2,10.46

In this Meaning of the Word, both the Prophets of old, and the Apostles
were proper <font> Enthusiasts: <$$font> being at divers Times so filled
with the Spirit, and so influenced by Him who dwelt in their Hearts,
that the Exercise of their own Reason, their Sense, and all their natural
Faculties being suspended, they were wholly actuated by the Power of
God, and <font> speak <$$font> only <font> as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,10.47

<P_11>

IX.  WESLEY-1755-2,11.49

Others take the Word in an indifferent Sense, such as is neither morally
Good nor Evil.  WESLEY-1755-2,11.50

Thus they speak of the <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> of the Poets;
of <font> Homer <$$font> and <font> Virgil <$$font> in particular.
WESLEY-1755-2,11.51

And this a late eminent Writer extends so far as to assert, there
is no Man excellent in his Profession, whatsoever it be, who has
not in his Temper a strong Tincture of <font> Enthusiasm.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,11.52

By <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> these appear to understand, an uncommon
Vigour of Thought, a peculiar Fervour of Spirit, a Vivacity and Strength
not to be found in common Men: elevating the Soul to greater and higher
Things, than cool Reason could have attained.  WESLEY-1755-2,11.53

X.  WESLEY-1755-2,11.54

But neither of these is the Sense wherein the Word <font> Enthusiasm
<$$font> is most usually understood.  WESLEY-1755-2,11.55

The Generality of Men, if no farther agreed, at least agree thus far
concerning it, That it is something Evil: WESLEY-1755-2,11.56

and this is plainly the Sentiment of all those, who call the Religion
of the Heart, <font> Enthusiasm.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,11.57

<P_12>

Accordingly I shall take it in the $following {TEXT:fol-} Pages, as an
Evil: a Misfortune, if not a Fault.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.59

XI.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.60

As to the Nature of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>, it is undoubtedly
a Disorder of the Mind; and such a Disorder, as greatly hinders the
Exercise of Reason.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.61

Nay sometimes, it wholly sets it aside: WESLEY-1755-2,12.62

it not only dims, but shuts the Eyes of the Understanding.
WESLEY-1755-2,12.63

It may therefore well be accounted a $Species {TEXT:Spieces} of Madness
; of Madness rather than of Folly: seeing a Fool is properly one who
draws wrong Conclusions from right Premises: where a Madman draws right
Conclusions, but from wrong Premises.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.64

And so does an Enthusiast.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.65

Suppose his Premise true, WESLEY-1755-2,12.66

and his Conclusions would necessarily follow.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.67

But here lies his Mistake, WESLEY-1755-2,12.68

his Premises are false.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.69

He imagines himself to be what he is not: WESLEY-1755-2,12.70

and therefore setting out wrong, the farther he goes, the more he wanders
out of the Way.  WESLEY-1755-2,12.71

<P_13>

XII.  WESLEY-1755-2,13.73

Every <font> Enthusiast <$$font> then is properly a Madman.
WESLEY-1755-2,13.74

Yet his is not an ordinary, but a religious Madness.  WESLEY-1755-2,13.75

By religious, I do not mean, that it is any Part of Religion.  Quite the
reverse: WESLEY-1755-2,13.76

Religion is, the Spirit of a sound Mind: WESLEY-1755-2,13.77

and consequently stands in direct Opposition to Madness of every Kind.
WESLEY-1755-2,13.78

but {COM:sic_lowercase} I mean, it has Religion for its Object; it is
conversant about Religion.  WESLEY-1755-2,13.79

And so the <font> Enthusiast <$$font> is generally talking of Religion,
of God, or of the Things of God: But talking in such a Manner that
every reasonable Christian may discern the Disorder of his Mind.
WESLEY-1755-2,13.80

<font> Enthusiasm <$$font> in general may then be described in some such
Manner as this: a religious Madness arising from some falsely imagined
Influence or Inspiration of God: at least, from imputing something to
God which ought not to be imputed to him, or expecting something from
God which ought not to be expected from him.  WESLEY-1755-2,13.81

XIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,13.82

There are innumerable Sorts of <font> Enthusiasts.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,13.83

Those which are most common, <P_14> and for that Reason most dangerous ,
I shall endeavour to reduce under a few general Heads, that they may be
more easily understood and avoided.  WESLEY-1755-2,14.84

The First Sort of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> which I shall mention,
is that of those who imagine they have the <font> Grace <$$font> which
they have not.  WESLEY-1755-2,14.85

Thus some imagine, when it is not so, that they have <font> Redemption
<$$font> through Christ, <font> even the Forgiveness of Sin.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,14.86

These are usually such as <font> have no Root in themselves <$$font>;
no deep Repentance or thorough Conviction.  WESLEY-1755-2,14.87

<font> Therefore they receive the Word with Joy.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,14.88

And because <font> they have no Deepness of Earth <$$font>, no deep
Conviction $in their Heart, therefore the Seed <font> immediately
springs up.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,14.89

There is immediately a superficial Change, which together with that light
Joy, striking in with the Pride of their unbroken Heart, and with their
inordinate Self-love, easily persuades them, they have already <font>
tasted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come.
<$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,14.90

<P_15>

XIV.  WESLEY-1755-2,15.92

This is properly an Instance of the first sort of <font> Enthusiasm:
<$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,15.93

it is a kind of Madness, arising from the Imagination, that they have
that Grace which in Truth they have not; so that they only deceive their
own Souls.  WESLEY-1755-2,15.94

Madness it may justly be termed: WESLEY-1755-2,15.95

for the Reasonings of these poor Men are right, were their Premises good:
WESLEY-1755-2,15.96

but as those are a mere Creature of their own $Imagination
{TEXT:Imgination}, so all that is built on them falls to the Ground.
WESLEY-1755-2,15.97

The Foundation of all their Reveries is this: they imagine themselves
to have Faith in Christ.  WESLEY-1755-2,15.98

If they had this, they would be <font> Kings and Priests to God <$$font>
, possest {COM:sic} of a Kingdom which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be moved.
<$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,15.99

But they have it not.  WESLEY-1755-2,15.100

Consequently, all their following Behaviour, is as wide of Truth and
Soberness, as that of the ordinary Madman, who fancying himself an
earthly King, speaks and acts in that Character.  WESLEY-1755-2,15.101

<P_16>

XV.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.103

There are many other <font> Enthusiasts <$$font> of this Sort.
WESLEY-1755-2,16.104

Such, for instance, is the fiery Zealot for Religion; or <paren> more
probably <$$paren> for the Opinions and Modes of Worship, which he
dignifies with that Name.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.105

This Man also strongly imagines himself, to be a Believer in Jesus,
yea, that he is a Champion for the Faith, which was once delivered to
the Saints.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.106

Accordingly all his Conduct is formed, upon that vain Imagination.
WESLEY-1755-2,16.107

And allowing his Supposition to be just, he would have some tolerable Plea
for his Behaviour: whereas now it is evidently the Effect of a distempered
Brain, as well as of a distempered Heart.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.108

XVI.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.109

But the most common of all the <font> Enthusiasts <$$font> of this
Kind, are those who imagine themselves Christians, and are not.
WESLEY-1755-2,16.110

These abound not only in all Parts of our Land, but in most Parts of
the habitable Earth.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.111

That they are not Christians is clear and undeniable, if we believe the
Oracles of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,16.112

For Christians are holy; WESLEY-1755-2,16.113

these <P_17> are unholy: WESLEY-1755-2,17.114

Christians love God; WESLEY-1755-2,17.115

these love the World.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.116

Christians are humble; WESLEY-1755-2,17.117

these are proud: WESLEY-1755-2,17.118

Christians are gentle; WESLEY-1755-2,17.119

these are passionate.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.120

Christians have the Mind which was in Christ; WESLEY-1755-2,17.121

these are at the utmost Distance from it.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.122

Consequently they are no more Christians, than they are Archangels.
WESLEY-1755-2,17.123

Yet they imagine themselves so to be; WESLEY-1755-2,17.124

and they can give several Reasons for it.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.125

For they have been <font> called so <$$font> ever since they can remember
: WESLEY-1755-2,17.126

they were <font> christened <$$font> many Years ago: WESLEY-1755-2,17.127

they embrace the <font> Christian Opinions <$$font> vulgarly termed,
the Christian or Catholick Faith.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.128

They use the <font> Christian Modes of Worship <$$font>, as their Fathers
did before them.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.129

They live what is called a good, <font> Christian Life, <$$font> as the
rest of their Neighbours do.  WESLEY-1755-2,17.130

And who shall presume to think or say, that these Men are not Christians ?
Though without one Grain of true Faith in Christ, or of real, inward
Holiness!  without ever having tasted the Love of God, or been <font>
made Partakers of the Holy Ghost!  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,17.131

<P_18>

XVII.  WESLEY-1755-2,18.133

Ah poor Self-deceivers!  WESLEY-1755-2,18.134

Christians ye are not.  WESLEY-1755-2,18.135

But ye are <font> Enthusiasts <$$font> in an high Degree.
WESLEY-1755-2,18.136

Physicians heal yourselves.  WESLEY-1755-2,18.137

But first, know your Disease: WESLEY-1755-2,18.138

your whole Life is <font> Enthusiasm: <$$font> as being all suitable to
the $Imagination {TEXT:Imigination}, that you have received that Grace
of God which you have not.  WESLEY-1755-2,18.139

In Consequence of this grand Mistake, you blunder on, Day by Day,
speaking and acting under a Character which does in no wise belong to you.
WESLEY-1755-2,18.140

Hence arises that palpable, glaring Inconsistency, that runs thro'
your whole Behaviour: which is an aukward {COM:sic} Mixture of real
Heathenism and imaginary Christianity.  WESLEY-1755-2,18.141

Yet still, as you have so vast a Majority on your Side, you will always
carry it by mere Dint of Numbers,"That $you {TEXT:your} are the only
Men in your Senses, and all are Lunaticks who are not as you are.
"WESLEY-1755-2,18.142

But this alters not the Nature of Things.  WESLEY-1755-2,18.143

In the sight of God and his holy Angels, yea, and all the Children of
God upon Earth, you are mere Madmen, mere <font> Enthusiasts <$$font>
<P_19> all.  WESLEY-1755-2,19.144

Are you not?  WESLEY-1755-2,19.145

Are you not <font> walking in a vain Shadow <$$font>, a Shadow of
Religion, a Shadow of Happiness?  WESLEY-1755-2,19.146

Are you not still <font> disquieting yourselves in vain?  <$$font>
With Misfortunes as imaginary as your Happiness or Religion?
WESLEY-1755-2,19.147

Do you not fancy yourselves great or good?  WESLEY-1755-2,19.148

Very knowing, and very wise!  WESLEY-1755-2,19.149

How long?  WESLEY-1755-2,19.150

Perhaps till Death brings you back to your Senses; to bewail your Folly
for ever and ever!  WESLEY-1755-2,19.151

XVIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,19.152

A second sort of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>, is that of those who
imagine they have such <font> Gifts <$$font> from God as they have not.
WESLEY-1755-2,19.153

Thus some have imagined themselves to be endued with a Power of working
Miracles, of healing the Sick by a Word or a Touch, or restoring Sight
to the Blind; yea, even of raising the Dead, a notorious Instance of
which is still fresh in our own History.  WESLEY-1755-2,19.154

Others have undertaken to prophesy, to foretell Things to come, and that
with the utmost Certainty and Exactness.  WESLEY-1755-2,19.155

But a little Time usually convinces these <font> Enthusiasts.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,19.156

When plain Facts run counter to their Predictions, <P_20> Experience
performs what Reason could not, WESLEY-1755-2,20.157

and sinks them down into their Senses.  WESLEY-1755-2,20.158

XIX.  WESLEY-1755-2,20.159

To the same Class belong those, who in Preaching or Prayer, imagine
themselves to be so influenced by the Spirit of God as in Fact they
are not.  WESLEY-1755-2,20.160

I am sensible indeed, that without him we can do nothing: more especially
in our publick Ministry; That all our Preaching is utterly vain, unless
it be attended with his Power, and all our Prayer, unless his Spirit
therein help our Infirmities.  WESLEY-1755-2,20.161

I know, if we do not both preach and pray by the Spirit, it is all but
lost Labour: WESLEY-1755-2,20.162

seeing the Help that is done upon Earth, he doth it himself, who worketh
all in all.  WESLEY-1755-2,20.163

But this doth not effect {COM:sic} the Case before us.
WESLEY-1755-2,20.164

Though there is a real Influence of the Spirit of God, there is also an
imaginary one; WESLEY-1755-2,20.165

and many there are who mistake the one for the other.
WESLEY-1755-2,20.166

Many suppose themselves to be under that Influence, when they are not,
when it is far from them.  WESLEY-1755-2,20.167

And many others suppose, they are more <P_21> under that Influence then
they really are.  WESLEY-1755-2,21.168

Of this Number, I fear, are all they who imagine, that God dictates
the very Words they speak: and that consequently, it is impossible they
should speak any Thing amiss, either as to the Matter or Manner of it.
WESLEY-1755-2,21.169

It is well known, how many <font> Enthusiasts <$$font> of this sort also
, have appeared during the present Century: some of whom speak in a far
more authoritative Manner, than either St. <font> Paul <$$font>
or any of the Apostles.  WESLEY-1755-2,21.170

XX.  WESLEY-1755-2,21.171

The same sort of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>, tho'in a lower Degree,
is frequently found in Men of a private Character.  WESLEY-1755-2,21.172

They may likewise imagine themselves to be influenced or directed by
the Spirit, when they are not.  WESLEY-1755-2,21.173

I allow, <font> if any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none
of his: <$$font> and that if ever we either think {TEXT:missing_comma}
speak or act aright, it is through the Assistance of that blessed Spirit.
WESLEY-1755-2,21.174

But how many impute Things to him, or expect Things from him, without
any rational or scriptural Ground?  WESLEY-1755-2,21.175

Such are <P_22> they who imagine, they either do or shall, receive <font>
particular Directions <$$font> from God, not only in Points of Importance,
but in Things of no Moment, in the most trifling Circumstances of Life.
Whereas in these Cases God has given us our own Reason for a Guide:
tho'never excluding the <font> secret Assistance <$$font> of his Spirit.
WESLEY-1755-2,22.176

XXI.  WESLEY-1755-2,22.177

To this Kind of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> they are peculiarly exposed ,
who expect to be directed of God, either in spiritual Things or in common
Life, in what is justly called, an <font> extraordinary <$$font> Manner.
WESLEY-1755-2,22.178

I mean, by Visions or Dreams, by strong Impressions, or sudden Impulses
on the Mind.  WESLEY-1755-2,22.179

I do not deny, that God has of old Times manifested his Will in this
Manner.  Or, that he can do so now.  WESLEY-1755-2,22.180

Nay, I believe, he does, in some very rare Instances.
WESLEY-1755-2,22.181

But how frequently do Men mistake herein?  WESLEY-1755-2,22.182

How are they misled by Pride and a warm Imagination, to ascribe such
Impulses or Impressions, Dreams or Visions to God, as are <P_23> utterly
unworthy of him?  WESLEY-1755-2,23.183

Now this is all pure <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>, all as wide of Religion
as it is of Truth and Soberness.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.184

XXII.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.185

Perhaps some may ask,"Ought we not then to enquire, what is <font>
the Will of God <$$font> in all Things?  WESLEY-1755-2,23.186

And ought not his Will to be the Rule of our Practice? "
WESLEY-1755-2,23.187

Unquestionably it ought.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.188

But how is a sober Christian to make this Enquiry?  To know, <font>
what is the Will of God?  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,23.189

Not by waiting for supernatural Dreams.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.190

Not by expecting God to reveal it in Visions.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.191

Not by looking for any <font> particular Impressions <$$font>, or sudden
Impulses on his Mind.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.192

No: But by consulting the Oracles of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.193

<font> To the Law and to the Testimony.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,23.194

This is the general Method of knowing what is <font> the holy and
acceptable Will of God.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,23.195

XXIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,23.196

"But how shall I know what is <font> the Will of God <$$font>, in such
and such a particular Case?  WESLEY-1755-2,23.197

The Thing proposed is in <P_24> itself of an indifferent Nature, and so
left undetermined in Scripture. "WESLEY-1755-2,24.198

I answer, the Scripture itself gives you a general Rule, applicable to
all particular Cases, WESLEY-1755-2,24.199

<font> The Will of God is our Sanctification.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,24.200

It is his Will that we should be inwardly and outwardly holy; that we
should <font> be good and do good <$$font> in every Kind, and in the
highest Degree whereof we are capable.  WESLEY-1755-2,24.201

Thus far we tread upon firm Ground.  WESLEY-1755-2,24.202

This is as clear as the shining of the Sun.  WESLEY-1755-2,24.203

In order therefore to know, what is <font> the Will of God <$$font>
in a particular Case, we have only to apply this general Rule.
WESLEY-1755-2,24.204

XXIV.  WESLEY-1755-2,24.205

Suppose, for Instance, it were proposed to a reasonable Man, to marry;
or to enter into a new Business: WESLEY-1755-2,24.206

in order to know, whether this is <font> the Will of God, <$$font>
being assured,"It is <font> the Will of God <$$font> concerning me,
that I should be as holy and do as much Good as I can,"he has only to
inquire,"In which of these States can I be most holy, and do the most
Good? "WESLEY-1755-2,24.207

And <P_25> this is to be determined, partly by Reason, and partly by
Experience.  WESLEY-1755-2,25.208

Experience tells him what Advantages he has in his present State, either
for being or doing Good: WESLEY-1755-2,25.209

and Reason is to shew, what he certainly or probably will have in the
State proposed.  WESLEY-1755-2,25.210

By comparing these he is to judge, which of the two may most conduce to
his being and doing Good: WESLEY-1755-2,25.211

and as far as he knows this, so far he is certain, what is <font> the
Will of God.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,25.212

XXV.  WESLEY-1755-2,25.213

Meantime, the Assistance of his Spirit is supposed, during the whole
Process of the Inquiry.  WESLEY-1755-2,25.214

Indeed it is not easy to say, in how many Ways, that Assistance is
conveyed.  WESLEY-1755-2,25.215

He may bring many Circumstances to our Remembrance, WESLEY-1755-2,25.216

may place others in a stronger and clearer Light; WESLEY-1755-2,25.217

may insensibly open our Mind to receive Conviction, and fix that
Conviction upon our Heart.  WESLEY-1755-2,25.218

And to a Concurrence of many Circumstances of this Kind, in Favour of what
is acceptable in his Sight, he may superadd such an unutterable <P_26>
Peace of Mind, and so uncommon a Measure of his Love, as will leave
us no Possibility of doubting, That <font> this <$$font> even <font>
this <$$font>, is his Will concerning us.  WESLEY-1755-2,26.219

XXVI.  WESLEY-1755-2,26.220

This is the plain, scriptural, rational Way to know, what is <font>
the Will of God <$$font> in a particular Case.  WESLEY-1755-2,26.221

But considering how seldom this Way is taken, and what a Flood of <font>
Enthusiasm <$$font> must needs break in, on those who endeavour to know
<font> the Will of God <$$font> by unscriptural, irrational Ways: it were
to be wished, that the Expression itself, were far more sparingly used.
WESLEY-1755-2,26.222

The using it, as some do, on the most trivial Occasions, is a plain
Breach of the third Commandment.  WESLEY-1755-2,26.223

It is a gross Way of taking the Name of God in vain, WESLEY-1755-2,26.224

and betrays great Irreverance {COM:sic} toward him.  WESLEY-1755-2,26.225

Would it not be far better then, to use other Expressions, which are
not liable to such Objections?  WESLEY-1755-2,26.226

For Example.  Instead of saying on any particular Occasion,"I want to
know what is <font> the Will of God.  <$$font>"Would it <P_27> not be
better to say,"I want to know, what will be most for my Improvement:
and, what will make me most useful. "WESLEY-1755-2,27.227

This Way of speaking is clear and unexceptionable.  WESLEY-1755-2,27.228

It is putting the Matter on a plain, scriptural Issue, and that without
any Danger of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>.  WESLEY-1755-2,27.229

XXVII.  WESLEY-1755-2,27.230

A third very common sort of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> <paren> if it
does not co-incide {COM:sic} with the former <$$paren> is that of those
who think to attain the End without using the Means, by the immediate
Power of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,27.231

If indeed those Means were providentially withheld, they would not fall
under this Charge.  WESLEY-1755-2,27.232

God can, and sometimes does, in Cases of this Nature, exert his own
immediate Power.  WESLEY-1755-2,27.233

But they who expect this when they have those Means, and will not use
them, are proper <font> Enthusiasts.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,27.234

Such are they who expect to understand the holy Scriptures, without
reading them and meditating thereon: yea, without using all such Helps
as are in their Power, and may probably conduce to <P_28> that End.
WESLEY-1755-2,28.235

Such are they who <font> designedly <$$font> speak in the publick Assembly
, without any Premeditation.  WESLEY-1755-2,28.236

I say <font> designedly: <$$font> because there may be such Circumstances
, as at some Times make it unavoidable.  WESLEY-1755-2,28.237

But whoever <font> despises <$$font> that great Means of speaking
profitably, is so far an <font> Enthusiast.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,28.238

XXVIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,28.239

It may be expected that I should mention what some have accounted, a
fourth sort of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>, namely, The imagining those
Things to be owing to the Providence of God, which are not owing thereto.
WESLEY-1755-2,28.240

But I doubt.  WESLEY-1755-2,28.241

I know not what Things they are, which are not owing to the Providence
of God: in ordering, or, at least, in governing of which, this is not
either directly or remotely concerned.  WESLEY-1755-2,28.242

I except nothing but Sin: WESLEY-1755-2,28.243

and even in the Sins of others, I see the Providence of God to <font> me.
<$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,28.244

I do not say, his <font> general Providence <$$font>; WESLEY-1755-2,28.245

for this I take to be a sounding Word, which <P_29> means just nothing.
WESLEY-1755-2,29.246

And if there be a <font> particular Providence <$$font>, it must extend
to all Persons and all Things.  WESLEY-1755-2,29.247

So our Lord understood it, WESLEY-1755-2,29.248

or he could never have said, <font> Even the Hairs of your Head are
all numbred.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,29.249

And, <font> Not a Sparrow falleth to the Ground, without the Will of
your Father which is in Heaven.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,29.250

But if it be so, if God presides <font> universis tanquam singulis,
et singulis tanquam universis <$$font>; over the whole Universe as over
every single Person, over every single $Person {TEXT:Per-} as over the
whole Universe: What is it <paren> except only our own Sin <$$paren>
which we are not to ascribe to the Providence of God?  So that I $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} apprehend, there is any Room here, for the Charge of
<font> Enthusiasm.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,29.251

XXIX.  WESLEY-1755-2,29.252

If it be said, The Charge lies here:"When you impute <font> this <$$font>
to Providence, you imagine yourself the peculiar Favourite of Heaven. "I
answer, you have forgot some of the last Words I spoke, <P_30> <font>
Praesidet universis tanquam singulis.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,30.253

His Providence is over all Men in the Universe, as much as over any
single Person.  WESLEY-1755-2,30.254

Do not you see, that he who believing this, imputes any Thing which
befalls him to Providence, does not therein make himself any more the
Favourite of Heaven, than he supposes every Man under Heaven to be?
WESLEY-1755-2,30.255

Therefore you have no Pretence, upon this Ground, to charge him with
<font> Enthusiasm.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,30.256

XXX.  WESLEY-1755-2,30.257

Against every sort of this, it behoves {COM:sic} to guard, with the utmost
Diligence: considering the dreadful Effects it has so often produced,
and which indeed naturally result from it.  WESLEY-1755-2,30.258

Its immediate Offspring is Pride; WESLEY-1755-2,30.259

it continually increases this Source from whence it flows,
WESLEY-1755-2,30.260

and hereby it alienates us more and more, from the Favour and from the
Life of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,30.261

It dries up the very Springs of Faith and Love; of Righteousness and
true Holiness.  Seeing all these flow from Grace.  WESLEY-1755-2,30.262

But God <font> resisteth the <P_31> Proud, WESLEY-1755-2,31.263

and giveth Grace <$$font> only <font> to the humble.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,31.264

XXXI.  WESLEY-1755-2,31.265

Together with Pride there will naturally arise an unadvisable and
unconvincible Spirit.  So that into whatever Error or Fault the <font>
$Enthusiast {TEXT:Enthusiasts} <$$font> falls, there is small Hope of
his Recovery.  WESLEY-1755-2,31.266

For Reason will have little Weight with him <paren> as has been justly
and frequently observed <$$paren> who imagines he is led by an higher
Guide, by the immediate Wisdom of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,31.267

And as he grows in Pride, so he must grow in Unadvisableness and in
Stubbornness also.  WESLEY-1755-2,31.268

He must be less and less capable of being convinced, less susceptible of
Persuasion; more and more attached to his own Judgment and his own Will,
till he is altogether fixt and immoveable.  WESLEY-1755-2,31.269

XXXII.  WESLEY-1755-2,31.270

Being thus fortified both against the Grace of God, and against all Advice
and Help from Man, he is wholly left to the Guidance of his own Heart,
and of the <P_32> King of the Children of Pride.  WESLEY-1755-2,32.271

No Marvel then that he is daily more rooted and grounded in Contempt
of all Mankind, in furious Anger, in every unkind Disposition, in every
earthly and devilish Temper.  WESLEY-1755-2,32.272

Neither can we wonder at the terrible outward Effects, which have flowed
from such Dispositions in all Ages: even all Manner of Wickedness, all the
Works of Darkness, committed by those who called themselves Christians,
while they wrought with Greediness such Things, as were hardly named
even among the Heathens.  WESLEY-1755-2,32.273

Such is the Nature, WESLEY-1755-2,32.274

such is the dreadful Effects, of that many-headed Monster <font>
Enthusiasm!  <$$font> From the Consideration of which, we may
now draw some plain Inferences, with regards to our own Practice.
WESLEY-1755-2,32.275

XXXIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,32.276

And, First, If <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> be a Term, though so frequently
used, yet so <P_33> rarely understood, take <font> you <$$font> Care, not
to talk of you know not what, not to use the Word, till you understand it.
WESLEY-1755-2,33.277

As in all other Points, so likewise in this, learn to think before
you speak.  WESLEY-1755-2,33.278

First know the Meaning of this hard Word; WESLEY-1755-2,33.279

and then use it, if Need require.  WESLEY-1755-2,33.280

XXXIV.  WESLEY-1755-2,33.281

But if so few, even among Men of Education and Learning, much more among
the common Sort of Men, understand this dark, ambiguous Word, or have
any fixt Notion of what it means: Then, Secondly, Beware of judging
or calling any Man an <font> Enthusiast <$$font> upon common Report.
WESLEY-1755-2,33.282

This is by no Means a sufficient Ground, for giving any Name of Reproach
to any Man, WESLEY-1755-2,33.283

least of all is it a sufficient Ground, for so black a Term of Reproach
as this.  WESLEY-1755-2,33.284

The more Evil it contains, the more cautious you should be, how you apply
it to any one: to bring so heavy an Accusation without full <P_34> Proof,
being neither consistent with Justice nor Mercy.  WESLEY-1755-2,34.285

XXXV.  WESLEY-1755-2,34.286

But if <font> Enthusiasm <$$font> be so great an Evil, beware you are
not intangled therewith yourself.  WESLEY-1755-2,34.287

Watch and pray that you fall not into the Temptation.
WESLEY-1755-2,34.288

It easily besets those who fear or love God.  WESLEY-1755-2,34.289

O beware you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to think.
WESLEY-1755-2,34.290

Do not imagine you have attained the Grace of God, to which you have
not attained.  WESLEY-1755-2,34.291

You may have much Joy: WESLEY-1755-2,34.292

you may have a Measure of Love, and yet not have Living Faith.
WESLEY-1755-2,34.293

Cry unto God that he would not suffer you, blind as you are, to go out
of the Way; that you may never fancy yourself a Believer in Christ,
till Christ is revealed in you, and till his Spirit witnesses with your
Spirit, and that you are a Child of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,34.294

<P_35>

XXXVI.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.296

Beware you are not a fiery, persecuting <font> Enthusiast.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,35.297

Do not imagine that God has called you, <paren> just contrary to the
Spirit of him you stile your Master <$$paren> to destroy Mens'Lives,
and not to save them.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.298

Neither dream of forcing Men into the Ways of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.299

Think yourself, WESLEY-1755-2,35.300

and let think.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.301

Use no Constraint in Matters of Religion.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.302

Even those who are farthest out of the Way, never <font> compel to
come in <$$font>, by any other Means, than Reason, Truth and Love.
WESLEY-1755-2,35.303

XXXVII.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.304

Beware you do not run with the common Herd of <font> Enthusiasts <$$font>
, fancying you are a Christian when you are not.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.305

Presume not to assume that venerable Name, unless you have a clear,
scriptural Title thereto: unless you have the Mind which was in Christ,
and walk as he also walked.  WESLEY-1755-2,35.306

<P_36>

XXXVIII.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.308

Beware you do not fall into the second sort of <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>
, fancying you have those <font> Gifts <$$font> from God which you
have not.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.309

Trust not in Visions or Dreams; in sudden Impressions, or Strong Impulses
of any Kind.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.310

Remember, it is not by these you are to know, what is <font> the Will
of God <$$font> on any particular Occasion; but by applying the plain
Scripture Rule, with the Help of Experience and Reason, and the ordinary
Assistance of the Spirit of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.311

Do not lightly take the Name of God in your Mouth: WESLEY-1755-2,36.312

Do not talk of <font> the Will of God <$$font> on every trifling Occasion.
WESLEY-1755-2,36.313

But let your Words, as well as your Actions, be all tempered with
Reverence and godly Fear.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.314

XXXIX.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.315

Beware, lastly, of imagining you shall obtain the End, without using
the $Means {TEXT:Meads} conducive to it.  WESLEY-1755-2,36.316

God <font> can <$$font> <P_37> give the End, without any Means at all;
WESLEY-1755-2,37.317

but you have no Reason to think he <font> will.  <$$font>
WESLEY-1755-2,37.318

Therefore constantly and carefully use these Means, which he has appointed
to be the ordinary Channels of his Grace.  WESLEY-1755-2,37.319

Use every Means which either Reason or Scripture recommends, as conducive
<paren> through the free Love of God in Christ <$$paren> either to the
obtaining, or increasing any of the Gifts of God.  WESLEY-1755-2,37.320

Thus expect a daily Growth in that pure and holy Religion, which the
World always did, and always will call <font> Enthusiasm: <$$font> but
which to all who are saved from real <font> Enthusiasm <$$font>, from
mere nominal Christianity, is the Wisdom of God and the Power of God,
the glorious Image of the Most High: Righteousness and Peace : a Fountain
of living Water, springing up into everlasting Life!  WESLEY-1755-2,37.321

<font> Finis.  <$$font> WESLEY-1755-2,37.322
