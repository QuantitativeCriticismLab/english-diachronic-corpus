She Wiping down the Dust with her Handkerchief.  <$$font> <$$heading>
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.5

<font> Enter <$$font> Judith.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.6

<font> Widow.  <$$font> Judith!  What hast thou been doing all this
Morning, that my Dressing-Room is in this Pickle?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.7

<font> Jud. <$$font> Pickle!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.8

<font> Wid. <$$font> Ay, Pickle, Sauce-box; Why dost thou Eccho me?
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.9

<font> Jud. <$$font> Eccho you!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.10

<font> Wid. <$$font> Again!  - Indeed I shall slap your Chaps, if
you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} learn to leave off repeating my Words after me.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.11

<font> Jud. <$$font> After you!  - Marry, I -
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.12

<font> Wid. <$$font> <bracket> <font> Gives her a Box o'the Ear
<$$font> <$$bracket> You will do it then.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.13

<font> Jud. <$$font> Will do what?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.14

$Ch $em {TEXT:Chem} zhour, $chem can do nothing to please you!

<font> Wid. <$$font> Life!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.18

What is thy Life, Muck-worm, to a clean Room?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.19

Dost thou imagine Rooms lie thus at Court?  Ha, Slattern?
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.20

<font> Jud. <$$font> They $can $n't {TEXT:can't} lie better,
I think, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,35.21

<P_36>

<font> Wid. <$$font> Think!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.23

Why dost thou think, Animal?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.24

What hast thou to do with Thought?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.25

Mind thy own Business.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.26

and never puzzle thy Noddle with Thought.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.27

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Philip, <font> and <$$font> Tally.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.28

Bless me!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.29

my Lord, and Sir <font> Philip!  <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.30

- I am asham'd to be caught in this Disorder!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.31

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> My Lord and I have been fetching a Walk
, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.32

and I could not persuade his Lordship to pass by your Door, Cousin,
without calling.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.33

You are his North, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.34

and he is embark'd in the Cock-boat of Love, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.35

and is constantly pointing this way.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.36

<font> Wid. <$$font> You are very pleasant this Morning, Sir
<font> Philip.  <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.37

But.  - CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.38

<font> Tally.  <$$font> I ask your Pardon, Madam; CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.39

but finding your Door open, and no-body in the way, the Knight
undertook to be Master of the Ceremonies, as well as to answer the
Reproaches I might reasonably expect from you, for this Liberty -
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.40

<font> Wid. <$$font> Oh, good my Lord, no Apology!
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.41

That ought to be done by me for the Disorder your Lordship finds me in.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.42

- Go, Beesom, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.43

and look for your Fellow-Puzzles, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.44

and ask'em, Why they leave my Doors open?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.45

I shall be robb'd one of these Days.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.46

- Sure, never any-body was so fatigu'd with Servants as I am.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.47

Did you ever visit a Lady in a Stable before, my Lord? !
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.48

I shall be stuck, mir'd, laid fast, and forc'd to be dug out like
a Potatoe.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.49

<bracket> <font> Holds up her Coats, CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.50

and walks cautiously.  <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.51

<font> Tally.  <$$font> A Stable, Madam!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.52

I protest I think your House is as much in Order, as any Lady's in
<font> London.  <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.53

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> Ay, my Lord, there are few of the
Quality such Housewives, as my Cousin.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.54

If it be your Lordship's good Fortune to marry her, $she $'ll
{TEXT:she'll} set the Ladies at Court a Pattern.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.55

<font> Wid. <$$font> Fy, Sir <font> Philip <$$font>!
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.56

This to my Face!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.57

it looks like Flattery.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,36.58

<P_37>

<font> Tally.  <$$font> What would be Flattery to another, is but doing
you Justice, Madam.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.60

- <font> Wid. <$$font> Women have no Defence against the fine
Things you well-bred Men say.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.61

To raise our Vanity, and make us have a good Opinion of ourselves,
you are sure, is one way to be well in our Esteem.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.62

<font> Tally.  <$$font> I should think myself the happiest Man
living, if I cou'd perceive I had the least Share in yours, Madam.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.63

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> His Lordship complains, Cousin, that
you are Inexorable.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.64

- Hark ye, one Word with you.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.65

- $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} over-stand your Market.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.66

A Man of Quality is not to be caught every Day.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.67

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} an old Rogue, now!  <bracket> <font> Aside.
<$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.68

<font> Wid. <$$font> Wou'd you have me marry a Man as soon as he
asks me the Question, Sir <font> Philip?  <$$font> CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.69

I think, to have an Amour with a Person of Rank known and talk'd of,
is one of the greatest Inducements to Matrimony; especially if it gives
the rest of my Sex Pain.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.70

<font> Fain.  <$$font> <bracket> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$bracket>
Right Woman, on my Conscience!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.71

<font> Tally.  <$$font> More than your whole Sex.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,37.78

<font> Wid. <$$font> Your Lordship will make me vain.

<font> Wid. <$$font> How often must I instruct you to behave
$yourself {TEXT:your_self} before Company?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,38.91

Will you never learn Manners, Booby?  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,38.92

Ay!  but <font> Curst Cows have short Horns, <$$font> we say in our

Nothing but thy Twenty thousand Pounds could make Amends for thy

<P_41>

- I admire you give your-self the Trouble of Country-Servants, Madam.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.188

<font> Wid. <$$font> I would not keep a Town-Servant, my Lord,
if they would live with me for nothing.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.189

Their whole Attention is Drunkenness and Pride.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.190

The dirtiest Trollup in the Town must have her Top-knot and Tickin-shoes.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.191

This City spoils all Servants.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.192

I took a <font> Welsh <$$font> Runt last Spring, whose Generation scarce
ever knew the Use of Stockens: CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.193

And - will you believe me, my Lord?  She had not liv'd with me Three
Weeks, before she sew'd Three Penny-Canes round the Bottom of her Shirt,
instead of a Hoop-Petticoat.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.194

<font> Sir Phil. <$$font> That was something better than a Wench
at my House, who dis-rob'd a Barrel, and let all the Ale about the Cellar.
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.195

One of the Ends of the Hoop working out, discover'd the Trick,
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.196

and at the same time flung down a Side-Board of Glasses.  - Ha, ha, ha!
CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.197

<font> Tally.  <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.198

<font> Wid. <$$font> Ay, they do more Mischief than their Necks

If the Parliament $do $n't {TEXT:don't} lay a Tax upon their Pride,
there will be no living.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,41.200

I wish your Lord-ship would take it into Consideration.

The People are related to a Friend of mine in <font> Holland <$$font>

I believe they let no Lodgings.  CENTLIVRE-1723-2,67.1026
