<font> January 4, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.3

My dears, I am in such a hurry to tell you my own story my own way,
as we have it from the very best authority, for fear you should hear
it differently, from those vile papers, that I must jump at once in
medias res.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.4

The Pope has been very ill, so ill from Influenza that he was obliged
to get out of his bed on Friday to go to the Gesu`, for the Thanksgiving
Service, and only went because the Jesuits would certainly have made it a
tool against him, if their service had been the only one he had neglected.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.5

Secondly, it had always been said that there would be a row on New Year's
Day - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.6

the Austrians have only withdrawn from Ferrara, in order to prosecute
their intrigues with less suspicion in Rome, under colour of that retreat.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.7

There is a Jesuit-Austriaco party which on one side, irritates and excites
the people, on the other, alarms the Pope.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.8

On Friday night, all the troops were ordered to be under arms, and 7,000
of the Civic Guard to be at their quarters.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.9

On Saturday the whole of the University wished to go to the Quirinal
and wish the Pope buon capo d'Anno - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.10

they went - their officers, among whom was our friend Orioli
going with them to keep order and make it look respectable.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.11

But when they, with a great collection of people, got to the Quirinal,
the palace gates were shut.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.12

With great difficulty the officers succeeded in getting them home again
, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.13

and they determined to send a deputation of four to the Pope to make
their excuses and their explanations.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.14

Orioli was one, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.15

but when he went to the place of rendezvous to meet his colleagues,
he found only one other - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.16

they were frightened or cautious.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.17

However, he determined to go, and do his duty by the Scolaresca, whether
he was received or not.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.18

The Pope did not receive him, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,156.19

but sent word that he was indisposed, which was true, and that Orioli
was to say his say to the Cameriere, which he did, and which was only to
the <P_157> effect that the Scolaresca was very sorry that it had been
so ill interpreted to the Pope as having meant insurrection, that all
it desired was to wish him a buon Capo d'Anno.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.20

Meanwhile the people, infuriated at finding the palace gates shut, and
at a report which the Jesuit-Austriaco party had circulated among them,
that orders had been given to the Governor of Rome to fire upon them,
<paren> which last order you will, I have no doubt see gravely asserted
in the papers to be true, as the S. Herberts implicitly swallowed
it - and some English goose will write it home <$$paren> - the people
ran to the Senator, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.21

and tumultously {COM:sic} insisted on his going to His Holiness to inquire
why the Palace gates were shut, what had become of His Holiness, that
they would see him, that they were very anxious about him, that they
were very angry at having been so mistrusted and misinterpreted, that
they only wanted to know how he was, and had some advice to give him,
etc. etc. - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.22

in short, behaved like naughty children, but nothing more.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.23

Prince Corsini, the Senator, at first tried to pacify them,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.24

but when he found that rather the more a tumult was made, he agreed to
go to the Pope, provided they would disperse, and would promise, none of
them, to go with him, <paren> the Pope besides having a terrible attack
of grippe <$$paren>.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.25

He went, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.26

but the people forgetting their promise joined him half way
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.27

and went too - so that when he got to the Palace, there was a perfect
rout.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.28

{COM:ellipsis}

here my story necessarily is imperfect.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.30

On Sunday at 1$$2 past 3 we were to have an audience of the Pope,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.31

but at 2 o'clock we were put off - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.32

the Pope had been obliged to drive out to show himself to the people;
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.33

he went to all the quarters of the Civic Guard, himself, <paren> and
was received with unprecedented enthusiasm, <$$paren> though he was so
ill that he fainted in the carriage coming back, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.34

was attended home by twelve thousand people.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.35

Ciceruacchio got up behind the attendants carriage,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.36

drove into the Quirinal with them - where the Pope said he was too
ill to give the Benediction, but he was with the people and for them.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.37

C. went out with this message, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.38

said A casa, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,157.39

and within 1$$4 of an hour <P_158> all were dispersed.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.40

All this sounds very childish, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.41

but will be represented in France as an insurrection.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.42

{ED:Letter_XXIX_Addressed_to_W._E._Nightingale._Embley}

<font> January 8, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.44

I hope Mr. Bracebridge finished my story for me, dear people,
last Tuesday.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.45

I left off where Corsini, the Senator, went in to the Pope.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.46

The Pope was amazed and indignant at finding from him that the gates
of the Quirinal were shut and himself barricaded in his own palace
, which had been done without his orders, or even his knowledge;
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.47

he instantly sent to have the gates opened, and the guards dismissed -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.48

and the Governor of Rome, who was the author of it, is to resign.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.49

This Governor, who is in the Jesuit-Austriaco service, had gone the night
before to frighten Pius with the news of an insurrection, who had simply
said to him, Take the measures you think proper, whereupon the man had
done all this.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.50

Pius then went out to all the Civic Guard quarters himself, as I told you,
contrary to the advice of his physician, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.51

for he fainted coming back, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.52

and has been very ill since, to their great alarm -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.53

but he insisted upon going, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.54

and would only have four Guardia Nobili with him,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.55

and those were not allowed to ride by the carriage, that the people might
come up to the very windows, if they liked it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.56

Mr. B. was out NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.57

and saw it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,158.58

He would not go through the Corso for fear of disturbing <P_159> the
Sunday promenade, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.59

but the people intreated him to go, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.60

and he did.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.61

He was exceedingly pleased with his reception, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.62

the people insisted on kissing his hand through the window -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.63

one man, a well dressed man, addressed him NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.64

and said, Believe me, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.65

you may believe me, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.66

the Jesuits are in"trama"against you and your life.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.67

The new Government does not give satisfaction.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.68

Mezzofanti, who in all but languages, is an Asino, is to have Public
Instruction, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.69

Cardinal Riario Sforza, who has always been considered quite"stupido
"is to have Agriculture and Commerce - judge what he will make of it -
<paren> I hope you got our last Tuesday's Motu Proprio <$$paren> and
Amici, Internal Affairs.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.70

Oh would that the Pope had some good man about him -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.71

but he has none, no not one, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.72

and God must send his good angels to inspire him.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.73

Mr. B. has been to see Ventura NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.74

and took S. Herbert there yesterday.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.75

Ventura has but one panacea for Ireland, repeal.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.76

But, said S. H. {COM:sic} that $wo $n't {TEXT:won't}
prevent them from starving, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.77

"Pardonnez moi, Monsieur, la liberte` donne du pain. "
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.78

What was to be done with the me`contens?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.79

"Oh, they were to be pendus, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.80

and the rest were to have repeal.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.81

He had seen Wiseman and Lord Arundel about Ireland,"he said,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.82

"but they were des Anglais, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.83

what could they know about Ireland - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.84

they knew nothing - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.85

he believed no one but MacHale.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.86

The monarchie Anglaise was chancelante - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,159.87

there had been a conspiracy in the commencement du re`gne de la <P_160>
Reine Victoire among the Aristocracy to renverser the Queen <paren>
the Bedchamber Plot you know, <$$paren> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.88

and the throne might not stand such another! ! " NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.89

S. H. told him he was an Irish proprietor
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.90

and tried to set him right about some things, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.91

but though exceedingly cordial, he said S. H. could know
nothing about it, and begged them to come again, etc. etc.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.92

He has been prevented from preaching however during the Epiphany, for
fear he should do something incautious.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.93

Meanwhile Pio Nono is more popular than ever, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.94

but no one else is, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.95

it is the Pope and the People, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.96

that is the misfortune.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.97

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} think P. Ventura is a fool,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.98

far from it, he knows a great deal - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.99

he knew the whole Hampden story - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.100

but he has two ide`es fixes NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.101

<paren> most men have but one <$$paren> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.102

and they are absolute and entire liberty politically, absolute and entire
despotism religiously.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.103

At the same time you understand he has not the least idea of the <font>
real <$$font> workings of a free country - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.104

for to all S. H.'s questions as to <font> how <$$font> you would
do this and that in Ireland, he only answered as if the Sovereign had
nothing to do but put out her hand, and Jericho's walls would fall on
the one party, and repeal and bless the other.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.105

Alas!  alas.  He would not believe S. H. when he told him
that he, a proprietor, paid dimes, P. Ventura asserting that the
great hardship was that the tenants, the Catholics, paid the tithes, while
the proprietor, the Protestant, paid none.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.106

He is a good natured, burly friar, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.107

was sitting at dinner with four obedient $Yamens {ED:?} <paren> priests
<$$paren> waiting his nod, three of whom he dismissed, when he received
Messrs. B. and H.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,160.108

, and went on cutting great slices of cheese, and extending his forefinger
in absolute <P_161> conviction all the while he was talking to them.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.109

He is extremely eloquent and fluent.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.110

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} go into the Artist question now, having done
that to Aunt Patty.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.111

I am in furious haste too, as you see by this political nonsense -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.112

it all sounds very childish, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.113

but as my reminiscences will keep, and Pio is of rather more importance
than my feelings about Rome, I send what I think most interesting.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.114

Bless you all, my dear people - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.115

bless me too - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.116

and bless this poor noble victim of ignorance and difficulty, who is
struggling so gloriously to the light.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.117

You see the misery is, that the people will think now, that they can
get anything by making a little row.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.118

There was a cry of Morte ai Gesuiti, the other night,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.119

but the people for once, had the good sense to cry out, E pagato,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.120

and the fellow was arrested.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.121

The people cry but too often, Viva Pio Nono <font> solo.  <$$font>
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.122

The affair of the poor man who attacked Torlonia about the Tabacchi e
Sale is going badly - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.123

they say he will be convicted and condemned - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.124

for how can he prove his libel to be true?  - though no one has any doubt
of its being a libel, i. e. of its being strictly true.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.125

{ED:Letter_XXX_Addressed_to_Mrs._Nightingale._Embley}

<font> January 11, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.127

My dear people, I do trust that you are not taken in by Rossi.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.128

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} read anything except what $is on one side -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.129

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} my way - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.130

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} listen to anything but what is against him.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.131

Dear Mme. Sismondi knows nothing about it.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,161.132

Aunt Patty has written <P_162> to me - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.133

she is taken in $by Mme. S. - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.134

do You preserve the right amount of prejudice pure and undivided in your
minds - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.135

if there is anything aggravating in this world, it is to see the absolute
success of intellect.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.136

Rossi is a man who has no faith, in any thing, no principle upon anything
- NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.137

but see how talent does instead of faith.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.138

A capital name has been given him, the"condottiere"of intelligence -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.139

he <font> has <$$font> served under every $banner -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.140

at Geneva he was praying in the prayers of every religion,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.141

in France he is a Catholic.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.142

Cappellari <paren> the future Gregory XVI <$$paren> speaks thus of the
future Ambassador of L. Philippe to Gregory XVI, un certo avvocato,
cattolico rinnegato.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.143

But I must speak of him in the words of a greater man, who says, that
his principal aim is success.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.144

Ambition inspired him with the science of expediency,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.145

$revealed to him the vulnerable points of many an amour-propre,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.146

$he possesses the key of the passions of humanity,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.147

he uses $"$...  fruitful art.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.148

"$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you see how he is a Jesuit against $Jesuits,
out Jesuiting Jesuitism -'NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.149

he is the"truchement du pou $...  $"and nothing else.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.150

The"condottiere"has <font> no <$$font> country, no opinions $to defend -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.151

ideas, the tree of life to us, are wanting to $him.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.152

He does not care for the Jesuits, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.153

he cares for nothing but Rossi.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.154

I beg Gioberti's pardon - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.155

but he is taking Pius's name in vain, to talk of Rossi as his supporter,
as Mme. Sismondi does.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,162.156

<P_163>

Last Tuesday we were presented to the Pope.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.158

We went to the Quirinal at half past four, as we had received the
notification, where our Monsignore <paren> Hamilton <$$paren> joined us.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.159

We waited a few minutes by the fire in a little waiting room -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.160

there were no other females but us, a few other gentlemen.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.161

Then Hamilton was sent for, and a moment after, we.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.162

The Santo Padre stood in a small oblong room by a table with a crucifix
upon it, with his face to the light.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.163

Vengano, vengano, vengano pure avanti, he said, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.164

We kissed his hand.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.165

Then he talked a little in Italian about the bankruptcies in England
, the distress, the Statistical returns of deaths being increased,
etc. NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.166

and gave us his blessing.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.167

His voice is one of the most charming I have ever heard,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.168

and his manner easy, courteous, benevolent, is quite that of a
man of the world, with the grace besides of his own good heart.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.169

It is a very pretty picture, the reception room, that beautiful old man
<paren> for his hair is very grey, and his face wrinkled, though he is but
55, and walks so fast, he outstrips all his court <$$paren> entirely in
white, with his little white cap, standing by the table, covered with a
crimson table cloth, an ivory crucifix and book upon it, under a crimson
canopy, the black figure of a woman in a veil curtseying at the door,
and the little group of uniforms behind her.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.170

There were only two priests in the room, so that we had him all to
ourselves.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.171

You make three distinct genuflexions as you go up.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.172

When I reached him, I curtsied as low as I possibly could,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.173

and gave his hand a most fervent press - with my lips.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.174

I was not in the least frightened - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.175

I should have thought it so wicked to have gone into the presence of
that good man with one worldly thought.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.176

I said to myself, If I can get out of the room without having had one
earthly idea, I shall be satisfied - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.177

but you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know how the coeur vous serre, when you
do get out, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.178

and you think, Now I shall never see that beautiful countenance again
on earth.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.179

I did not quite succeed in what I intended, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.180

but I did penance for it afterwards.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.181

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do justice to the benevolence of his expression
, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,163.182

<P_164>

but I am afraid of dwelling upon it to you usque ad nauseam.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.184

I wish he had somebody to take care of him.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.185

Have popes mothers?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.186

I never thought of that.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.187

Mr. Herbert had a private interview with the Santo Padre
<paren> through our Monsignore <$$paren> upon Irish affairs.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.188

Pius listened very attentively, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.189

did not say much, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.190

but I am happy to say, quite converted Mr. Herbert to him.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.191

I was sure he would, if they once got face to face.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.192

These rows at Milan make people very uneasy.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.193

I was introduced to Confalonieri's widow the other night -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.194

she remembered our name, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.195

and we were great friends in a moment.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.196

I am to go and see her - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.197

she talked a great deal about him.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.198

You know that he died at Ospenthal on St. Gottard {COM:sic} upon
his way to Italy, where he longed to return.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.199

It is intensely cold here now.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.200

I have been doing a good many convents and hospitals with Mrs.
Herbert, to which her Russian cousin obtains {TEXT:obtain} entrance
for her.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.201

They are too long to tell about now.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.202

I have had some charming letters from you, dear people.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.203

The Pontifical Government is fitted up, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.204

people are somewhat dissatisfied.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.205

Cardinal Massimo had died since his appointment NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.206

and they hope that his place may be filled by a layman.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.207

Ventura is not nearly so often with the Pope as formerly.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.208

The Municipio has gone te`te baisse`e into ferreting out all the abuses,
scandals, pecuniary mismanagements of the charity and city revenues.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.209

Sparing nothing, it has wisely taken the old bull by the horns -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.210

and such abuses have come out.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,164.211

The <font> balance <$$font> of Cardinal Tosti's administration of the
<P_165> Ospedale di S. Michele proves to be a <font> deficit
<$$font> of 4 1$$2 millions of scudi <paren> in the last 10 years
<$$paren>.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.212

In no city in the world, not even in London, are such sums given for
charity.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.213

The Municipio has disinterred the accounts of all these -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.214

and the scandals are really too atrocious to repeat.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.215

All has been given by favour, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.216

and people driving in the Corso in their own carriages receive 50, 60,
70 scudi a month from charity.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.217

In one case, the woman reserved it for her tea parties.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.218

I hope that, in our old pension list, favouritism as tremendous, existed.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.219

Still, in the Holy City, such scandals cause more"ribrezzo".
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.220

Having some respect for Religion, one is sorry for it, for her sake.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.221

But Pius has heard the voice, Arise, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.222

shine, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.223

for thy light is come, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.224

and has arisen.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.225

The difficulty is, who are to be his advisers?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.226

The College of Cardinals is so notoriously incapable, that every one says
, there are <font> none <$$font> in it less unfit {COM:"un"_in_italics}
to be his Ministers than those just chosen who are giving so much
dissatisfaction.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.227

A lay ministry is too much to hope for just at present,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.228

but it must come.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.229

Meanwhile patience, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.230

these people are babies in the art of governing,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.231

they have not learned even to walk yet, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.232

how can one expect them to walk well?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.233

But the faith and the will are there, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.234

and faith is every thing.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.235

$The Consulta is also doing its duty, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.236

but its difficulties are awful indeed - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.237

without any definite track of what its duties are to be, it has the
ungrateful task of routing out abuses without, like the Municipio, having
the remedy in its own hands - as the Municipio is without appeal, and has
no responsibility towards any other Council.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.238

The accounts from Naples are tremendous, the cruelties exercised by
the Government.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.239

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} believe the stories of tortures we hear.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.240

Austria has applied to the Santo Padre for permission to send
a body of troops through the Pontifical States to Naples -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.241

it is impossible that he can grant it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.242

How grateful our proud England ought to be for her insular position which
has enabled her to mature her liberties, amid the lull of continental
storms, more terrible than those of <font> her <$$font> winds and waves.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,165.243

<P_166>

There is a curious mixture here of every sort of life, from the holy
Sister of S. Vincent de Paul, who asked me yesterday whether
England was far from here, and whose whole soul was in her little
foundlings, to the struggling, quivering, Roman heart, which sees for
the first time liberty within the grasp of its hand and trembles lest
it should escape him - and the Holy Father, partaking of both sorts of
life - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.245

how can his mind suffice it?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.246

He is an ascetic in practice - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.247

during Advent he fasted 18 hours a day.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.248

The greatest comfort I have had respecting him was seeing his little
Oratory, with two Bibles - dear people, I will swear to the Bibles,
in it, and such a Guido.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.249

There, I trust he finds peace.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.250

I could be more homey myself with Guido than with any other painter -
even Raphael himself.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.251

I wish I had time to tell you all about it in this letter -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.252

farewell, dear people, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.253

and may we all live to see Rome the city of the Free -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.254

pardon this stupid letter.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.255

St. Antonio, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.258

January 17, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.259

My dearest people, I am really ashamed of you.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.260

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} speak to me in that manner.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.261

I am surrounded here by enemies of Pius, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.262

and shall I find foes in mine own household?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.263

Is Pius to wait till all his convictions are made up before he acts?
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.264

he would never act at all.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.265

What did we abuse all the former Popes for, but because they would never
listen to any body, but went on tramping on their own stupid, brutal,
wicked course.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.266

And now we despise Pius, because he listens - and acts accordingly.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.267

I thought that old cry of Consistency was blown up, sunk and
gone to the bottom with the chew-the-end thing it represents.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.268

Pius is no Napoleon in the talent of discrimination,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.269

I know that - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.270

but to be consistent, a man must be either superhuman or subhuman.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.271

Now for what he really is, such as those most indifferent to him,
represent him.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,166.272

His first desire is the good of his <P_167> people -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.273

it is his <font> real fervent pursuit <$$font>, that all acknowledge -
but with one condition: NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.274

- what is that?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.275

You do not expect, as the English do here, that he is to turn Protestant ,
do you?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.276

The one condition is, that he will do nothing contrary to his quality
as Pope.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.277

Now Jesuitical wretches get to him, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.278

and represent that this, and that are contrary to his quality as Pope.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.279

He is sincerely religious, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.280

and confesses once a week.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.281

Pollotta, a mock Saint, is his Confessor.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.282

This man stays 1$$4 of an hour before every image of a Madonna he meets
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.283

and recites 300 Aves, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.284

and thumps his breast with hard blows to make known to every one that
he is a vilissimus peccatore.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.285

He pulls his hat over his eyes, not that he may not see, but per non
essere veduto, mentre ei vede.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.286

He sees all that is doing 100 miles off, while he is looking in his
prayerbook.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.287

He has visions, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.288

and St. Antony appears to him one day, and St. $Thingumibob
one night, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.289

and tells him to run immediately in to the Pope and tell him that, if
he does not do this or that, he will injure the Catholic Religion or
the Pontificate.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.290

Pius, who never believed in any one's hypocrisy yet, has given this man
$a key, it is said, to his apartment, to come in at any hour $without
{TEXT:with_out} being announced, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.291

and hence comes a world of damage.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.292

No one suspects the Santo Padre's sincere piety -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.293

those indifferent to him say it is impossible to see him in church,
and not to see how he prays.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.294

The respect for the Church here is amazingly fallen.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.295

People used to be ready to fall on their knees when a Cardinal passed;
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.296

now they look the other way.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.297

Pius himself is loved as Papa Principe and not as Papa Papa.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.298

Meanwhile the Consulta and the Municipio boldly go their way.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.299

All sorts of abuses they have unveiled.  Imprigati, who receive
pensions for 40 years of <font> service <$$font>, and who are 30 years
of <font> age.  <$$font> Convents which receive the Pension granted to
them by Pius VII when he returned from Paris, because their lands were
taken away from them under Napoleon, and who now enjoy their lands and
pensions too - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.300

and $what $'s {TEXT:what's} more, 30 or 40 monks are enjoying what was
intended for 3 or 400 - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.301

for nobody makes himself a monk now, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.302

so the numbers are"decimated".  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,167.303

Tosti, besides his deficit as Chancellor <P_168> of the Exchequer, of 4
1$$2 millions, <paren> which I am afraid I represented to you as being
the deficit of S. Michele <$$paren> has <font> besides <$$font>
his nice little balance <font> there.  <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.304

I have told you what a"balance"means here.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.305

All these things the Consulta is dragging to light, a fanno inorridire.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.306

Vizardelli is to be the new Cardinal - a professor of the Sapienza
College here.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.307

Now, my dear people, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you give in about Pius.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.308

I never set him up as a Lycurgus, but as something better, the sincerest
and most benevolent of men, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.309

and I am sure I have been candid enough about his mistakes.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.310

The whole of Sicily, they say, is ready for revolt -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.311

Lord Minto had a courier yesterday.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.312

The King went to S. Carlo - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.313

the people did not dare hiss him, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.314

but a new ballet, which they had always applauded, they hissed every
step of.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.315

The King understood it full well, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.316

went home, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.317

and went <font> to bed <$$font>, where he has been ever since - e certo
non sara` pianto da Napoli, si viene a morire.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.318

He is entirely in the hands of a certain Monsignor Cocle, his confessor.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.319

A good many Neapolitan troops have been sent to Sicily.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.320

$It is said that Austria wants to get up a Rival Lega Dogonale with poor
little Parma and Modena.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.321

Heaven confound them!  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.322

But I was going to tell you about the Oratory of the Sto. Padre.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.323

The first time we went to be presented, and he was obliged to go out
because of the row, we thought as we were once in, we would do something
before we were got out, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.324

and I asked to see this Oratory, which is never seen, because he can
come in to it at any moment.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.325

It is the prettiest little cheerful place - one little chair in the
middle for him - all in disorder, just as he left it - a'heap of books
on one chair, i. e. two well-thumbed, well-dog's-eared,
old-women's, bound-in-black, fat bibles, then 3 or 3 little books ,
missals, and then a little thin book, which looked like a $Greek
$Testament.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.326

All looked and smelt as if it was constantly inhabited,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,168.327

two large bright windows, the altar quite plain, perfectly without
artificial flowers, or any ornament whatever - over it a large Guido of
the Annunciation - on one wall the Virgin making up domestic linen, and
an angel on each side learning to sew <P_169> from her, who are going to
help her, and are watching how she does it - a Padre Eterno in the little
cupola, with a Gloria of angels looking up - and a Virgin in adoration -
patriarchs and prophets about in odd corners.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.328

They are all Guido's very, very best.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.329

The flamingo who showed us in, a Cameriere in red, was in a great
fright to get us out, because there is a door into the Pope's own room.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.330

But I took a good look first.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.331

Here he had evidently just been, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.332

here he takes refuge from the troubles of his conscientiousness, <paren>
which have made him a grey old man at 55, <$$paren> - from the doubts,
the difficulties, <paren> which must tear a sincere man like wild horses ,
in twain <$$paren> - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.333

for he is scrupulous, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.334

and only Napoleons, without consciences, are"consistent"-
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.335

here he prays for light, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.336

and here that beautiful Angel of the Annunciation looks down upon him,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.337

and when he remembers the answer of the humble, hopeful Mary, he feels
that the day will come when all doubts shall be done away for him too,
when fears and hesitations shall vanish, and when those who have indeed
said from their very hearts,"Behold the servant of the Lord,"as I verily
believe {TEXT:believes} he has done, shall <font> also <$$font> be able
to say,"be it unto me according to thy word", all anxieties being removed
as to what that"word"is, and all fears as to whether we are not following
our own will after all, instead of discerning what the will of God for
us is.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.338

One might have more admiration for the intellect of Pius,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.339

but one would not have half the sympathy for him, if he were not beset
with anxieties.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.340

But I hope that to him too the angel brings peace.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.341

I had such pleasure in seeing his little Oratory,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.342

and I shall $bring {TEXT:being} home {COM:sigma}'s New Year's
gift as a remembrance of many things, both in heaven and earth.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.343

Orioli, the Professor at the Sapienza, and leader of the
Moderate party here, is my authority for these things about Pius.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.344

He is giving a course in Geology, the first man who has dared to do it in
Rome - but wisely opening his course with quoting St. Augustine,
who differs from Moses, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.345

and finding Minds Attentive, what he began with prudence, he has continued
with boldness.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.346

Mr. Colyar proves a most delightful acquaintance -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.347

he has taken us to the Lateran and Vatican - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.348

and Col. Lindsay says, is the best authority, not excepting Nibby,
in Rome.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.349

He is a fervent Catholic, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.350

but has taken no trouble with us - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.351

he has been quite a father to me.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,169.352

<P_170>

I have been once more to the Sistine, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.354

but am quite afraid of approaching that great subject.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.355

Five of the nine compartments of the roof <paren> the other four I do
not trouble myself about <$$paren> seem to me upon the very limits of
the Supernatural.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.356

The first I do not understand, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.357

there is an appearance of exertion, of effort about the Creator in the
act of creation.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.358

- but the second where the Padre Eterno creates the Sun and the Moon,
who can describe it?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.359

In the same compartment is a flying figure with its back to us, called
the Padro Eterno creating vegetation.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.360

I will never believe it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.361

I believe Michael Angelo intended it for the Spirit of Darkness flying
away before the Creator of Light.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.362

That was his idea, I am sure.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.363

It is a crouching, crestfallen figure, so well befitting the Spirit of
Darkness - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.364

and the Creator in the same picture is so divine -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.365

there is nothing material about the Act of Creation, nothing in
the movement of the arms to remind me of moulding or fashioning;
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.366

- it is,"he spake the word and it was done", that is, he willed and
it was.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.367

Oh how <font> could human <$$font> genius approach such a conception.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.368

Then the little Cherubim <paren> shrinking from the Moon, <$$paren>
clinging to Him, to this awful Majesty, in perfect love and confidence ,
afraid of his <font> works <$$font>, but not <font> of him <$$font> ,
it is so touching.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.369

I suppose that in all art, the idea must be one, and undivided;
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.370

human imperfection must come in at last, and prevent even a M.
Angelo from representing more than one of the attributes <paren> of
Him who has all attributes in Himself, <$$paren> in one great shadowing
forth - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.371

therefore the Omnipotence alone could be represented in this figure of
the Creator - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.372

but M. Angelo, unwilling to leave poor Mortals crushed and
annihilated under the idea of <font> Power Divine <$$font>, imagined
all these cari agnoletti clinging to the Great Unknown to show us that
though unknown even to them, he was not unloved and he was unfeared.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.373

Oh M. Angelo, arch priest of the Divinity, thou real priest and
minister of the Most High, art thou now an Archangel Michael, even as
he was perhaps once a mortal like thee.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.374

The next compartment is the Gathering of the Waters -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.375

and here too, there is nothing to remind one of earth in the drapery -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.376

it is all wonderfully carrying out the divine conception.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,170.377

But the three next speak perhaps the most fervently to the hearts of
poor mortals, i. e. the Creation <P_171> of Man, of Woman,
and their Fall.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.378

The difference between the characters of man and woman is so
extraordinarily kept.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.379

What we have just left was the Creation of Matter,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.380

we are come now to the Creation of Soul.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.381

The Padre Eterno having breathed into Adam the breath of life
, is just leaving him, committing to him his last behests.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.382

He veils none of the glory of his majesty from him,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.383

He appears before him in the full light of His presence, which none was
since to see and live, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.384

and Adam half rising from the earth, in the perfect sinless human
nature, <paren> there is nothing of the God, of the Apollo, about him,
he is perfectly fearless, but perfectly a subject, <$$paren> looks at
Him NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.385

and is not ashamed.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.386

There is however, nothing of the <font> inward <$$font> consciousness of
the Divine Presence in it; no speaking purely from <font> heart <$$font>
to <font> heart - <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.387

the Creator has made himself known to man by an outward manifestation,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.388

and man has understood and accepted it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.389

I do not make it clear, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.390

but any body looking at the Creation of <font> Woman <$$font>, will see
the difference - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.391

there she kneels, the lovely new born woman, before her Creator, who ,
in his unspeakable Goodness, has stripped himself of all his Power and
his Majesty, and stands before her in the semblance of a man, her father,
and her friend, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.392

and yet, such is the sublime idea of M. Angelo, that there is
nothing lost of dignity in the figure.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.393

Adam continues sleeping.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.394

No woman would have done this, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.395

she would have been warned <paren> by her quicker perception <$$paren>
of the presence of a supernatural being.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.396

Eve, kneeling in perfect love and devotion, receives with entire
submission, the commands of her Creator, which come straight from His
<font> spirit <$$font> to hers, without any material manifestation
of Power.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.397

She is lovely beyond description.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.398

But"devotion is not religion"- NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.399

and next, oh woe woe to us, comes the Fall.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.400

The Tempter, a female figure, is bewitchingly beautiful.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.401

<font> Adam <$$font> again does not see her, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.402

but <font> Eve <$$font>, lying quite quiet, close to the earth, anxious
to disguise from herself, her sin, and fearful to move, just stretches
out her arm, as a naughty child does, without making one motion towards
the forbidden fruit, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.403

and receives it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.404

Poor, poor Eve - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.405

in the same picture is the instant punishment - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.406

the difference between Man and Woman, between Reasoning and Inward
Perception, is still preserved.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,171.407

Adam's thoughts are towards <P_172> the favoured Paradise and the
Avenging Angel, <paren> who is still tender even in his wrath <$$paren>.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.408

He seems to address himself only to him, and to leave Eve to her own
feelings, which are enough.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.409

Adam regrets, departs, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.410

and it is done.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.411

Eve, crouching and heart stricken, scarcely giving a thought to what
she has lost, nor to the Material punishment awarded her, is an image
of the anguish of the soul, the long inward writhings of remorse,
which receive no alleviation and no embitterment from eternal things.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.412

She seems literally"swallowed up"by self-abasement.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.413

This, a wonderful conception, and these three, though less striking ,
are to me as superior in genius to the first, as the Creator of the Soul
is to that of Earth.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.414

The last of the 9 is the Drunkenness of Noah, as if M. Angelo
wished to show us to what depths human nature could descend, before he
came to the Judgement.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.415

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} make myself understood by these words
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.416

<paren> when I come home, we will have long talks about these fruitful
Five <$$paren>.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.417

The other day S, Mrs. Herbert and I went to see the Hospital of
Sto. Spirito, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.418

but when we got there, we found a permission was necessary,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.419

and the priest whom we spoke to, said O vadano, vadano pure loro stesso
dal Monsignore sopra, la dara` loro.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.420

Rather unwillingly we went up, having first sent up the servant, who
was refused it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.421

The Monsignore's servant took in our Card, also rather unwillingly,
we only meaning the Card to ask permission - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.422

and after a few moments came back NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.423

and desired us to follow him - we, hardly knowing whether it was to the
awful presence, or to the Enfans trouve`s, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.424

But, to provide against all dangers, we made Mrs. Herbert
, who is accustomed to speak to live cardinals, go first.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.425

Presently in the opening of the third door, I saw her curtseying on the
threshold, lower and lower - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.426

I thought she was going to kneel down - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.427

we went in - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.428

an immense round table separated the sacred Monsignore on one side and
the three impudent females on the other.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.429

Half rising, half ready to run round one side if we attempted to run at
him by the other, he asked us what we wanted - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.430

the hospital, he said, $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} be opened at all hours,
it was not to be expected, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.431

e` un affare molto curioso, he said - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,172.432

curiosissimo, I <P_173> thought.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.433

In a half scolding, half complaining voice, he asked whether we were
going to leave Rome soon.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.434

Nobody answered, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.435

so I thought they meant me to tell the lie, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.436

and bowing to the earth, I replied, <font> Very <$$font> soon.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.437

Well then, he said, when do you want to see the Convent?
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.438

Tomorrow, I said, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.439

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} too soon, he said, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.440

we $can $n't {TEXT:can't} get it ready.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.441

Well then Wednesday, I said very angrily.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.442

And do you want to see the Conservatorio <font> too <$$font>, in a
despairing tone.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.443

To be sure, I said, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.444

and again prostrating ourselves, we withdrew.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.445

I was laughing too much to make the least apology,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.446

but after we had finished our genuflexions, Mrs. Herbert went
back NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.447

and made one.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.448

Now mind that this story be locked in your breasts -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.449

it was so truly impudent - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.450

Inglesissimo, is the only adjective it deserves.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.451

However we got what we wanted NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.452

and tomorrow I will tell the result.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.453

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} suppose you want to hear about Dr. Hampden.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.454

I am convinced the great cause of the wrath and clamour against him is
that he has been incautious enough to <font> say <$$font> what half the
ecclesiastics <font> think <$$font>, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.455

and that has always been the unforgiven sin.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.456

If on the other hand, one is candidly to say which is the real Trinitarian
and which the infidel, he who believes the Trinity upon his own grounds
of conviction, or he who believes it upon those of others, whom he calls
authority, let any child decide.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.457

I have read more of the Bampton Lectures here, than I ever read in my
life NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.458

and think them beautiful.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.459

Enough of that.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.460

I have saved myself much trouble of investigation by coming at once to
the conclusion that every body has disgraced themselves but Lord John
and Dr. Hampden.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.461

$Wo $n't {TEXT:Won't} that do?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.462

I have a deal to say about home, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.463

but that is not exactly what you want to hear.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.464

Goodnight dear people.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,173.465

{ED:Letter_XXXII_Addressed_to_Mrs._Nightingale._Embley}

<font> Rome.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.468

January 18, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.469

My dearests, I have just had your welcome description of your Old Year:
s estremo istante.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.470

Mine was spent in my own room - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.471

and as the last toll of the great bell striking twelve sounded from
the Trinita` del Monte, I felt as if my breath stood still, and my
heart stopped beating, and as if the instant of death could scarcely be
more solemn.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.472

I could not begin my N. Year's Day at St. Peter's as I
intended, it rained so.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.473

I have a little corner of my own behind the left hand support looking
from the High Altar, where I always go - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.474

but I went to the Trinita` NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.475

and heard the nuns sing Adeste fideles with heavenly voices.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.476

Then we went to church, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.477

called upon the Herberts with our N. Year's wishes,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.478

then I had a talk with {COM:sigma}, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.479

went by myself to Vespers at the Trinita` - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.480

{COM:sigma} does not care for music, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.481

and when I came back, my children brought me a nosegay, which
measured a foot across, and some oranges out of their own garden.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.482

And so passed our N. Year's Day in great peace and joy,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.483

thanks be to God for it.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.484

The next day which was Sunday {COM:sigma} and I took Sacrament together
, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.485

and we did not go out again.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.486

Mr. B. did not come in till very late, it being the day
of the row, and the Santo Padre's going out to the Guardia Civica.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.487

Monday I went to St. Peter's before breakfast - to my own place
and home therein.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.488

Mr. B. and I called upon Mrs. Colyar next door,
who is uncommonly friendly when we are there, but determined to have
nothing to say to us.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.489

He on the contrary.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.490

And my affections, oh che contraste orrible between him and the Santo
Padre.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.491

Orioli came in to give us the account of the row.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.492

And then we dressed to kiss my Pius's hand, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.493

and the disgrazia happened to the"poor dogs"which I told you of, amply
remedied by our seeing the Oratory.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.494

Afterwards we went to see the Mausoleum of Augustus,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,174.495

but <P_175> the pieces of travertine, upon which the Emperors were burnt,
are now in the Vatican.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.496

Tuesday, we had a little Emerson boy in the morning to amuse,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.497

so I did not go out - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.498

and in the afternoon I was initiated into the awful presence of the
Countess Woronzow, late dame d'honneur to the Emperor Paul, and all
but witness of his murder, Mr. Herbert's aunt, and the"Baron "-
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.499

and went with them and Mrs. H. to the Bon Pasteur.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.500

<paren> I have been doing a course of convents and hospitals <$$paren>.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.501

I tumbled in love with the Mother Superior - herself a dame d'honneur
of the Bavarian court, and really a sort of Mme. de Sevigne`
turned nun.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.502

But oh the waste of life in this place, the intense cold, the miserable
pozza-smelling rooms, the shortening of life in consequence of these
good women, their hopeless task - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.503

for this order, of which the Good Shepherd at Hammersmith is a branch,
is devoted to the reclaiming of Penitents, or rather Non-Penitents,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.504

for all their sheep are goats, sent to them by the government, and
hopeless goats.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.505

A husband, father, or son, has here nothing else to do but to go to
the Vicario, and desire from him an order to send his refractory wife
, mother, or daughter to the Bon Pasteur - which order is generally
executed in the night, so that the goat arrives kicking, screaming,
violently agitated and perfectly unmanageable for two or three days,
during which time they are obliged to keep her in a room to herself,
or she would do a mischief.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.506

This order may be obtained for extravagance, or <font> any <$$font>
troublesome conduct.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.507

Mr. B. says he wishes there were some such law in England.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.508

We saw one woman there of the highest rank in Rome shut up by her son
for extravagance, and two young noble women, who however I believe were
really bad.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.509

But conceive the punishment it must be.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.510

The patience of the good nuns is admirable, a` toute e`preuve,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,175.511

<P_176>

they have no means of compelling subordination, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.513

and one, who had refused the night before to go to bed, the poor nun who
slept in her room, only said, Well, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} go to bed
till you do, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.514

and there they sat, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.515

and all I could do she said, was to pray the Holy Virgin to inspire her
with the thought of bed.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.516

If ever I saw sanctity upon earth,"holiness purified from self denial,
"it was among these women, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.517

but they admitted that they made hardly any reformations -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.518

if the case was only come in for 6 months, they considered it quite
hopeless, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.519

if for several years, they did hope.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.520

But none ever came voluntarily, they said, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.521

and many tried to run away.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.522

Those who married when they went out, which they sometimes do, because
they are well taught, <paren> everything but kitchen work is taught
them here.  No Italian woman learns that, because they all have their
dinners from Traitore <$$paren>, or get into good places, they do well
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.523

and then they always let the nuns hear from them.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.524

They never try to make them take the veil, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.525

and there is no temptation, because the nuns of the Bon Pasteur <font>
must <$$font> be women of good character.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.526

But they being all there under a sense of oppression, it is hoping
against hope - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.527

and even the Abbess admitted, if they come but for a short time, it
is hardly worth while to teach the uneducated ones to read or work.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.528

I thought their faces horrible; NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.529

they were merry, no formality, but no humility.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.530

The nuns keep them generally singing to prevent talking.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.531

And there these real martyrs go on working against hope.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.532

Many of the Penitents come in upon the verge of madness,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.533

and go mad in the convent.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.534

There was a poor Arab there, who was miserable.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.535

But the cold, how it must exasperate them.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.536

The nun, who was teaching them to work, seemed an admirable creature.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.537

There are but 9 nuns altogether, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.538

and some are always ill - hardly any of them Italians.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.539

The Superior showed me a head of Our Saviour crowned with thorns, which
had been the Holy Father's own, and which he gave to them because he
found it affected him too much, and worked upon his feelings unduly.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.540

But what a waste of energy of these poor nuns - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.541

one of my companions said how grateful the Penitents must be -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.542

Oh no, she said, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.543

they are not grateful, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.544

what cause have they?  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.545

They are here against their will NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.546

and they are very miserable here.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.547

They have no way of exercising them either NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,176.548

and it seems still an <P_177> untried region that of reclaiming
them, though few have, like these, the candour to say so.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.549

I went in the evening to Mrs. Sartoris's with the Herberts.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.550

I do so like incautious women, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.551

and Mrs. Sartoris is always saying incautious things <paren>
about her own childhood and education <$$paren> without seeing how she
shocks the good Lindsays.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.552

Then she is such a pendulum twixt a smile and tear, as I think I told
you - how she was moved to tears when I asked her to sing something
of Mendlesohn - and then pitied Abdel Kader, because she"fancied
the horror of having all the French women making love to one. "
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.553

Then she is such a perfect gentlewoman about her own former life, never
avoiding the subject of the stage, but saying quite simply that she had
not dared to be presented to the Pope, because she was one of those"
horrid singing women. "NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.554

But I must go, dearest mother.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.555

{ED:Letter_XXXIII_Addressed_to_R._Fowler,_Esq.,_M.D._Salisbury}

<font> Rome.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.557

January 21, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.558

My dear Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Herbert has handed over your
question to me about the Eleusinian mysteries NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,177.559

and I should <P_178> have a chapter to write in answer to it, did I not
think that Hope and some others would make a reply much more worthy of
you than I can.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.560

Do read the chapter in Thomas Hope's Essay on Architecture,
called"Heathen Customs kept up or emulated by the Christians.
"NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.561

It is the 17th of his first Vol., NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.562

and the previous chapter on the Symbols used by the early
Christians, as well as the 18th chapter bear up on the subject.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.563

The whole book is most interesting, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.564

but, though <font> his <$$font> prejudices are in favour of embracing a
Pagan faith, I think he might accord to <font> my <$$font> prejudices,
which are for the Christian one, the same toleration which I am quite
ready to grant to his.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.565

Though I quite agree that the early Christians were very provoking and
teased the Roman religion into giving them martyrdom, which they would
have, and would not be denied.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.566

Lord Lindsay <paren> whose book on Christian Art you perhaps know
<$$paren> recommends you"Sylvester Douglas"on"the remains of the Ancient
manners of Greece,"which will give a much better account than I can.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.567

With regard to the introduction however of Roman observances into our
religion, which is Mr. Hope's theory, Lord Lindsay tells me that
they are of still earlier date.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,178.568

The bonfires lighted here on St. John's Day for instance, the
origin of which Hope assigns to the fires kindled by the Romans in <P_179>
honour of the summer solstice, are anterior - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.569

and date from the worship of Baal.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.570

Among the Celtic nations the name even is preserved,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.571

and they are called the fires of Baal.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.572

Our Maypole in the same way takes its origin from the same time and
worship <paren> of Baal <$$paren>.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.573

Lord Lindsay's theory is that the Southern nations represent the principle
of <font> inclusiveness - <$$font> the Northern of <font> Protestantism.
<$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.574

Now the Italian nations are descendants of Greece and Rome, whose
principle was to incorporate all new religions, to assimilate all
conquered churches to their own.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.575

The German and English nations, on the other hand, descend from
the Persians, who represent the principle of Protestantism.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.576

The Persians protested against all other religions,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.577

they went forth determined to put down all but their own spiritual
worship of the unseen fire.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.578

The Persian contest with Greece and Rome was that between Protestantism
and Catholicism.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.579

You meet in these Southern lands with no fairies, gnomes, or supernatural
stories - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.580

they have all become angels or devils i. e. they are all
Christianized, assimilated.  Whereas, in Northern lands, all the stories
of heathen times remain.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.581

In France, which is a descendant of the <font> Roman <$$font>, S.
Denis is only the worship of Bacchus - Dionysos being his very name.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.582

SS. Eleutheros and Rusticus, his two companions, are
only the one, another name for Bacchus, the other for his rites.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.583

The Christians did themselves much harm by this assimilation of heathen
rites and symbols.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.584

But I am afraid that I am mangling what Lord Lindsay told me, which I
wish he would give to the world in print.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.585

I have wished that I could send you some account of the Deaf and Dumb
establishment here, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.586

but as there is only one for boys, females, who appear to
exist in Rome only upon sufferance, are not admitted to see it.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,179.587

Mrs. Herbert desires me to tell you that the direction of
Dr. So`stz, the person to whom you wished to send Dr.
Howe's and the Abbe $Carton $'s {TEXT:Carton's} <P_180> papers,
is Ehrenbreitstein, Coblentz - and that the parcel had better be
dispatched straight to Coblentz, as he will be delighted to have them.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.588

You are rejoicing as we are over this glorious Sicilian news.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.589

What a bombardment it was NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.590

and what a new life for a magnificent country, so long oppressed and
depopulated as poor Sicily.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.591

Of course the Obscuranti, as they are called here, meaning the old Tories,
object to the clause in the new Constitution, providing that Sicilian
employment shall be filled by Sicilians, and Neapolitan by Neapolitans,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.592

and say that fusion is the principle of the day.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.593

Yes, and pretty work we have made of fusion in Ireland.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.594

The Sicilian race is as superior to the Neapolitan, as the Greek was to
the Roman; NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.595

and yet the principle of fusion was to fill both Neapolitan and Sicilian
offices with <font> Neapolitans.  <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.596

The spot of the houses of Hortensius and Cicero is supposed to be
ascertained with tolerable exactness NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.597

but the palace of Augustus was built over their site,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.598

and now there is nothing left but a hideous English villa.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.599

The ruins of the Palatine are the despair of Antiquaries.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.600

Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge desire their kindest remembrance.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.601

So do Mr. and Mrs. Herbert, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.602

and believe me, my dear Dr. Fowler, with my very best love to dear
Mrs. Fowler, and hopes that neither you nor she have been <font>
aggrippate <$$font> as the Romans call being attacked with influenza.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,180.603

Your ever grateful and affectionate Florence Nightingale.

{ED:Letter_XXXIV_Addressed_to_E._E._Nightingale._Embley}

<font> Rome, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.607

this glorious day of her liberty.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.608

January 21, 1848 <$$font> NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.609

Well, my dear people, what do you think of this?
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.610

Is not this the most glorious news you have heard this many a day?
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.611

Oh if you knew how these Sicilians have fought!
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.612

For seven days!  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.613

They have behaved themselves like men NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.614

and so have the women.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.615

But you will see all that in the papers.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.616

The long and short of it is that the King has been obliged to give in,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.617

at least he had not sense enough himself to see that he must,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.618

but his brother did NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.619

and told him that he would not be a king the next day, if he did not.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.620

There is to be an amnesty, and liberty of the press,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.621

and Sicily is to have a constitution, and a Repeal of the Union
and to be governed only by Sicilians, and to have a Consulta -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.622

for all the people's cry was, We will have Pio Nono's reforms, nothing
less, nothing else.  So that it is he who has done it, and not they
themselves, after all.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.623

They say he is radiant, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.624

and I thought him so ill and so subdued at the Consistory yesterday,
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.625

and now he is as happy as he deserves to be.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.626

And Sicily will be herself again.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.627

You may believe all the stories of the iniquities practised at Naples
at the beginning of this revolt.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.628

Yes, the King actually had some old Sicilian noblemen, who had been taken
up for this revolt, branded in his presence, clothed as galley-slaves
and sent to the prisons at Procida.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.629

Absolute tortures Lord Eastnor tells {TEXT:tell} of, who is just come
back from Naples.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.630

But that is the way these Anointed of Heaven always begin -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.631

but the gallant Sicilians persisted, as you will see in the papers the
account of the siege, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.632

and have carried the day.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.633

The dear old Colyar rushed up to tell us the moment he had the news
this morning.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.634

I was out, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.635

so he came again tonight.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.636

But this is not all.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.637

Hurra for the greatest step Pio Nono has made yet.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.638

The government is secularized!  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.639

We have got laity into the ministry.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.640

Now, call him a priest and a coward any more, if you dare.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.641

Prince Gabrielli is at the head of the Army - Monsignor Savelli, who
was the Governor and had the department of Police besides, being sent
off to foreign parts as a nuncio; NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.642

Gaetani, an able man, has the Police - Monsignor Morichini being got
rid of $for a bishopric, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,181.643

and <P_182> Ferretti, the Cardinal's brother, has the Finance - Monsignor
Spada, who looked very glum at St. Peter's on Sunday, being got
rid of too.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.644

Cardinal Ferretti goes to Ravenna, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.645

and Cardinal Bofondi, the Pope's successor at his own bishopric of
Imola , succeeds him as Prime Minister, President of the Council and
Foreign Affairs.  So that you see the three departments of Arms, Finance
and Police are all in secular hands.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.646

But it is the principle, the great principle of breaking into this court
of priests, which is the thing.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.647

{COM:semantics_of_pseudo-imperative} Once let in the Atlantic
of secular knowledge and learning, and Mother Partington's
red_gloved {TEXT:red_gloved} hands can never bar it out again.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.648

Nobody thought that Pius would have the courage to do it -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.649

all hail to him - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.650

and they say that he is brilliant with joy.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.651

And these moments must repay him - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.652

for he said to Monsignor Rusconi, his own friend, who had the Arms,
when he sent him off to Ancona and Rusconi looked aghast, I know that
it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be very agreeable to you to leave the centre
of all things, Rome, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.653

but our life is one of sacrifice.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.654

I would I were back at my bishopric of Imola - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.655

but it is good for me to be here and for you to be at Ancona.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.656

Now, my dear friends, let us rejoice, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.657

for I too have behaved like a man, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.658

I have told you all my Pius's mistakes, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.659

his faults and his sufferings have not been hid from you -
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.660

and now let us sing and be glad at his success.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.661

And is not this the opening of a great day for Italy?
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.662

Now Naples $will join the Lega Doganale, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.663

now Italy will become $united $and independent, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.664

and perhaps the sun of our lives will not have set, before that of Austria
in Lombardy is gone down never to rise again.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.665

Metternich seems to be really dead, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.666

and the long prayed for moment may really yet be held in the lap of the
19th century, when Austria shall see the necks of her eagle cut off by
the Italian good sword.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.667

1848 has entered bravely on her course - bless her!
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.668

And so has the Municipio.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,182.669

To give you an idea.  Cardinal Tosti's brother, in the year of the
Cholera, 1834, was provided a nice little place by the Cardinal to
see after the cholera at the rate of so many scudi a <P_183> month.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.670

The cholera stopped, not so the salary, which has regularly entered the
monthly ragamuffin pocket of Mr. Tosti.  NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.671

Ah ha!  says the Municipio, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.672

and presents its compliments to Mr. Tosti, desiring him
not only to eject himself, but to refund this 13 years salary.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.673

The man demurs, and grumbles, NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.674

the Municipio persists - NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.675

and to do this to the brother of the late Treasurer and present
Cardinal, is a good daring Municipio, $me $seems {TEXT:meseems}.
NIGHTINGALE-1848-2,183.676
