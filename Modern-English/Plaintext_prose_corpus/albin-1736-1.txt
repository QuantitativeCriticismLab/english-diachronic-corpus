A <font> Natural History <$$font> of Spiders, <font> &c. <$$font>
ALBIN-1736-1,1.3

N=o=. I.  ALBIN-1736-1,1.4

<$$heading>

This Spider was of a scarlet colour, much resembling that of velvet;
ALBIN-1736-1,1.6

its feelers were something longer than is usually found in Spiders of
this bigness.  ALBIN-1736-1,1.7

It was found in <font> Cain-Wood <$$font> at the beginning of <font>
June <$$font>.  ALBIN-1736-1,1.8

They are likewise found in gardens on the bodies of trees:
ALBIN-1736-1,1.9

these last are something smaller than those found in the woods.
ALBIN-1736-1,1.10

These Spiders are accounted venomous.  ALBIN-1736-1,1.11

<heading>

N=o=. II.  ALBIN-1736-1,1.13

<$$heading>

This Spider was of an ash colour, the upper side of the belly marked
with black, the under side, of the same colour, without marks or spots.
ALBIN-1736-1,1.15

It had two black shining spots on the fore part of the body, and <P_2>
three on each side, two between the feelers, ALBIN-1736-1,2.16

in these spots stand their eyes, in number eight, placed in a semicircular
manner, the two uppermost being the largest.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.17

I have observed the Spiders, which have their eyes standing in this
manner, catch their prey, by jumping on it.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.18

<heading>

N=o=. III.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.20

<$$heading>

These Spiders are of a blackish colour, with a lightish streak on
their back.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.22

They are found in the spring time running on the ground, under the dead
grass in the fields and hedges.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.23

In the beginning of <font> June <$$font>, they are found with their
egg-bag, which is flattish and of a darkish colour, fastned to the
under part of their bellies, which they run very lightly away with.
ALBIN-1736-1,2.24

By the best observation with glasses, they are found to have but four
eyes; which are placed as they are expressed over the head of the Spider
in the Plate.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.25

<heading>

N=o=. IV.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.27

<$$heading>

This Spider is of a dark ash colour, finely spotted with black all over
the belly, back, and legs; having a streak of white in the middle of
the back, and upper side of the belly.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.29

Its legs are something lighter than the other parts, and the specks
something smaller.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.30

It had six eyes, standing as they are placed over the Spider in the Plate,
the two foremost of which are the least.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.31

<heading>

N=o=. V.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.33

<$$heading>

The back of this Spider was of a lead colour, the upper side of the
belly of a reddish or brownish cast, finely marked.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.35

The legs were marked with large spots of black and hair-colour.
ALBIN-1736-1,2.36

Its feelers are like shining globes, a little inclining to an oval figure,
of a dark colour, almost black.  ALBIN-1736-1,2.37

It could not be distinctly observed how many eyes it had.
ALBIN-1736-1,2.38

It was taken, in the beginning of <font> April <$$font>, on a burdock.
ALBIN-1736-1,2.39

<P_3>

<heading>

N=o=. VI.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.42

<$$heading>

The body and legs of this Spider was of a hair-colour, with a small black
mark across the upper end of the back: its belly of a blackish colour.
ALBIN-1736-1,3.44

It was taken in the fields, in the beginning of <font> April <$$font>.
ALBIN-1736-1,3.45

The eyes are so small, that it could not be perceived how many it had,
or their manner of standing.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.46

<heading>

N=o=. VII.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.48

<$$heading>

This Spider was all over of a light hair-colour, with a black spot on the
upper side of its belly, the under side of which was of an ash colour;
ALBIN-1736-1,3.50

it was taken in the fields, in the beginning of <font> April <$$font>
, running amongst the leaves and dead grass.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.51

<heading>

N=o=. VIII.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.53

<$$heading>

This Spider was of a dark colour, the upper side of the belly being
finely marked with a row of circular spots from the back to the end of
the tail with a scolloped {COM:sic} line on each side; ALBIN-1736-1,3.55

the back was dark on each side, and light in the middle.
ALBIN-1736-1,3.56

It had two eyes standing as they are placed in the Plate, over the head
of the Spider.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.57

Its feelers were long and slender, as are all those of the female Spiders
, the male having globular bunches or knobs at the ends of their horns
or feelers: ALBIN-1736-1,3.58

the young ones are marked exactly like the old ones; ALBIN-1736-1,3.59

only they look very pale which makes them appear as if they were naked,
ALBIN-1736-1,3.60

but may be easily known.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.61

This is one of the house Spiders, whose vertues are excellent in the cure
of intermitting fevers, when the bark and other remedies have failed,
as I have often experienced on several, both old and young; the use of
which I will now publish for the benefit of the poor and country people,
who are remote from the help of physicians.  ALBIN-1736-1,3.62

<font> The Use.  <$$font> ALBIN-1736-1,3.63

"Rx. As much of the clean web of the house Spider as the weight
of two scruples; Mithridate two drams; mix and give <P_4> it to the
patients the night before the fit; let them take after it four ounces
of treacle-water, and go to bed and cover themselves warm, endeavouring
to sweat.  They will have a most severe fit after the taking the first
dose, ALBIN-1736-1,4.64

but after the second dose it will leave them.  ALBIN-1736-1,4.65

By this method I have cured many people of stubborn and long continu'd
<font> tertian <$$font>, <font> quartan <$$font>, and <font> quotidian
<$$font> Fevers, particularly some of the servants of the Honourable
Colonel <font> Schutz <$$font>, when their taking the Bark for a long
time failed: as also Dame <font> Hughs <$$font> of <font> Tottenham-Court
<$$font> Road of a <font> tertian <$$font> Ague of three years continuance
, with many others.  ALBIN-1736-1,4.66

I have likewise cured several children, both male and female, by hanging a
large Spider confined alive in a box about their neck, reaching to the pit
of the stomach, without giving any internal remedies.  ALBIN-1736-1,4.67

Their web, with the addition of Frog-spawn, is a most excellent
styptick for bleeding at the nose, or any slight wound of the body.
"ALBIN-1736-1,4.68

<font> The Use.  <$$font> ALBIN-1736-1,4.69

Rx."The clean web of the house Spider, ALBIN-1736-1,4.70

and dip it in the spawn of Frogs, beaten as you would the whites of eggs,
several times letting it dry on pewter, or earthen plates, between each
time of dipping it, ALBIN-1736-1,4.71

and keep it in a box close stopt from air, ALBIN-1736-1,4.72

and apply it when you have occasion.  ALBIN-1736-1,4.73

With this remedy I saved a gentleman of worth in <font>
Lincolns-Inn-Fields <$$font>, who had bled at the nose several hours,
when all the applications failed which were used by two eminent Surgeons.
"ALBIN-1736-1,4.74

I have observ'd, since I writ this, a small Ichneumon Fly to lay its
eggs on the egg-bags of the house Spider, ALBIN-1736-1,4.75

the worms of them penetrating the bag, eat up the eggs, leaving the
skins; ALBIN-1736-1,4.76

and then make themselves small brown cases, in which they change
into Flies, which come out in the beginning of <font> May <$$font>.
ALBIN-1736-1,4.77

<heading>

N=o=. IX.  ALBIN-1736-1,4.79

the legs of this Spider are pretty long and of a redish {COM:sic} colour
, ALBIN-1736-1,5.91

the feelers were globular and hairy, ALBIN-1736-1,5.92

and on the outsides of them there was a bright knob of white, incircled
with yellow, which made it appear as if a little stone had been set
therein: ALBIN-1736-1,5.93

it had eight eyes standing as they are expressed over the Spider in
the Plate.  ALBIN-1736-1,5.94

This was a male Spider, ALBIN-1736-1,5.95

and was taken in a house in the beginning of <font> April <$$font>.
ALBIN-1736-1,5.96

It was taken in a garden in <font> April <$$font>.  ALBIN-1736-1,5.103

<heading>

N=o=. XII.  ALBIN-1736-1,5.105

ALBIN-1736-1,5.108

ALBIN-1736-1,5.109

and can move backwards and forwards, or sideways at its pleasure with
great agility.  ALBIN-1736-1,5.110

It was taken in a garden about the middle of <font> April <$$font>.

, with a large bag of eggs fastned to its tail, the outside of which
was white, with a cast of blew.  ALBIN-1736-1,6.120

There has been found several degrees in bigness of these Spiders, and
the colours the same; so that they do not alter or change their colours
as they grow bigger.  ALBIN-1736-1,6.121

An endeavour was made to take the egg from it; ALBIN-1736-1,6.122

but she was not willing to part with it, ALBIN-1736-1,6.123

but strove to hold it by clapping her legs about it a great many times:
ALBIN-1736-1,6.124

and when taken away, would run to it, and catch hold of it, endeavouring
to pull it to her again.  ALBIN-1736-1,6.125
