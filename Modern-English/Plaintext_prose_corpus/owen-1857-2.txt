Life of Robert Owen.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.3

Recollections of my Early Life.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.4

<$$heading>

As it appears in the family great Bible, I was born in Newtown ,
Montgomeryshire, North Wales, on the 14th of May, 1771, OWEN-1857-2,1,1.6

and was baptised on the 12th of June following.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.7

My father was Robert Owen.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.8

He was born in Welsh Pool, OWEN-1857-2,1,1.9

and was brought up to be a saddler, and probably an ironmonger also,
as these two trades were at that period often united in the small towns
on the borders of Wales.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.10

He married into the family of Williams, a numerous family, who were
in my childhood among the most respectable farmers around Newtown.
OWEN-1857-2,1,1.11

I think my mother <paren> who was deemed beautiful, as I was informed ,
when she was married <$$paren> was the eldest sister of the family, and,
for her class, superior in mind and manner.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.12

I suppose that on their marriage they settled in Newtown, - my father
taking up his own calling as a saddler and ironmonger.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.13

He was also post-master as long as he lived.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.14

He had the general management of the parish affairs, being better
acquainted, as it appears, with its finances and business, than any
other party in the township.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.15

I never thought of enquiring of him for any particulars respecting his
father or mother, both being dead before I was born; OWEN-1857-2,1,1.16

and owing to the then very bad state of the roads there was comparatively
little communication for young persons between Newtown and Welshpool.
OWEN-1857-2,1,1.17

All that I can recollect respecting my father's family is, hearing my
father say, in a conversation with older members of the family, that he
lost an estate of the value of five hundred pounds a year in a lawsuit,
which he afterwards ascertained was lost through his own lawyer being
bribed.  OWEN-1857-2,1,1.18

Newtown was at this period a very small market town, not containing
more than one thousand inhabitants, - a neat, <P_1,2> clean, beautifully
situated country village, rather than a town, with the ordinary trades,
but no manufactures except a very few flannel looms.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.19

I have not seen it since this clean village has been converted
into a dirty but thriving manufacturing town of some consequence.
OWEN-1857-2,1,2.20

At this period there was a bridge of wood over the river Severn, which
I remember with a deep impression, having nearly lost my life upon it,
as I will relate hereafter.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.21

I was the youngest but one of a family of seven, - two of whom died young.
OWEN-1857-2,1,2.22

The survivors, - William, Anne, and John, were older, and Richard was
younger than myself.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.23

The principal adjacent estate was <font> Newtown Hall, <$$font> at
the period of my birth and for a few years afterwards the property and
residence of Sir John Powell Price, Bart; OWEN-1857-2,1,2.24

- and my first recollection is of Sir John opening a glass door which
divided my father's shop from the dwelling part of the house, and setting
a bird flying towards us, saying there was something for the children's
amusement, and they must take care of it.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.25

This must have been shortly before he left his estate, I suppose from
being in debt, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.26

for it soon passed into other hands.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.27

My next recollection is being in school in apartments in the mansion of
this estate, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.28

and a Mr. Thickness, or some such name, was the schoolmaster.
OWEN-1857-2,1,2.29

I must have been sent young to school, - probably at between four and
five years of age, - OWEN-1857-2,1,2.30

for I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} remember first going there.
OWEN-1857-2,1,2.31

But I recollect being very anxious to be first in school and first home
, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.32

and the boys had always a race from the school to the town,
OWEN-1857-2,1,2.33

and, being a fast runner, I was usually at home the first, and almost
always the first at school in the morning.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.34

On one occasion my haste nearly cost me my life.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.35

I used to have for breakfast a basin of flummery, - a food prepared in
Wales from flour, and eaten with milk, and which is usually given to
children as the Scotch use oatmeal porridge.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.36

It is pleasant, and nutritious, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.37

and is generally liked by young persons.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.38

I requested that this breakfast might be always ready when I returned
from school, so that I might eat it speedily, in order to be the first
back again to school.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.39

One morning, when about five years old, I ran home as usual from school
, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.40

found my basin of flummery ready, and as I supposed sufficiently cooled
for eating, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.41

for no heat appeared to arise from it.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.42

It had skinned over as when quite cold; OWEN-1857-2,1,2.43

but on my hastily taking a spoonful of it, I found it was quite scalding
hot, the body of it retaining all its heat.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.44

The consequence was an instant fainting, from the stomach being scalded.
OWEN-1857-2,1,2.45

In that state I remained so long, that my parents thought life was
extinct.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.46

However, after a considerable period I revived; OWEN-1857-2,1,2.47

but from that day my stomach became incapable of digesting food, except
the most simple and in small quantity at a time.  OWEN-1857-2,1,2.48

This made me attend to the effects of different qualities of food on my
changed constitution, OWEN-1857-2,1,2.49

and gave me the habit of close <P_1,3> observation and of continual
reflection; OWEN-1857-2,1,3.50

and I have always thought that this accident had a great influence in
forming my character.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.51

In schools in these small towns it was considered a good education if
one could read fluently, write a legible hand, and understand the four
first rules of arithmetic.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.52

And this I have reason to believe was the extent of Mr. Thickness's
qualification for a schoolmaster, - because when I had acquired these
small rudiments of learning, at the age of seven, he applied to my father
for permission that I should become his assistant and usher, as from
that time I was called while I remained in school.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.53

And thence forward my schooling was to be repaid by my ushership.
OWEN-1857-2,1,3.54

As I remained at school about two years longer, those two years were
lost to me, except that I thus early acquired the habit of teaching
others what I knew.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.55

But at this period I was fond of and had a strong passion for reading
every thing which fell in my way.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.56

As I was known to and knew every family in the town, I had the libraries
of the clergyman, physician, and lawyer, - the learned men of the town -
thrown open to me, with permission to take home any volume which I liked,
OWEN-1857-2,1,3.57

and I made full use of the liberty given to me.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.58

Among the books which I selected at this period were Robinson Crusoe,
Philip Quarle, Pilgrim's Progress, Paradise Lost, Harvey's Meditations
among the Tombs, Young's Night Thoughts, Richardson's, and all other
standard novels.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.59

I believed every word of them to be true, OWEN-1857-2,1,3.60

and was therefore deeply interested; OWEN-1857-2,1,3.61

and I generally finished a volume daily.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.62

Then I read Cook's and all the circumnavigators'voyages, - the history
of the world, - Rollin's ancient history, - and all the lives I could
meet with of the philosophers and great men.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.63

At this period, probably when I was between eight and nine years of age,
three maiden ladies became intimate in our family, OWEN-1857-2,1,3.64

and they were Methodists.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.65

They took a great fancy to me, OWEN-1857-2,1,3.66

and gave me many of their books to read.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.67

As I was religiously inclined, they were very desirous to convert me to
their peculiar faith.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.68

I read and studied the books they gave me with great attention;
OWEN-1857-2,1,3.69

but as I read religious works of all parties, I became surprised, first
at the opposition between the different sects of Christians, afterwards
at the deadly hatred between the Jews, Christians, Mahomedans, Hindoos ,
Chinese, &c., &c., and between these and what they called
Pagans and Infidels.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.70

The study of these contending faiths, and their deadly hatred to each
other, began to create doubts in my mind respecting the truth of any
one of these divisions.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.71

While studying and thinking with great earnestness upon these subjects,
I wrote three sermons, OWEN-1857-2,1,3.72

and I was called the little parson.  OWEN-1857-2,1,3.73

These sermons I kept until I met with Sterne's works, in which I found
among his sermons three so much like them in idea and turn of mind,
that it occurred to me as I read them that I should be considered a
plagiarist, OWEN-1857-2,1,3.74

<P_1,4>

and without thought, as I could not bear any such suspicion, I hastily
threw them into the fire; which I often after regretted, as I should like
to know now how I then thought and expressed myself on such subjects.
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.76

But certain it is that my reading religious works, combined with my
other readings, compelled me to feel strongly at ten years of age that
there must be something fundamentally wrong in all religions, as they
had been taught up to that period.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.77

During my childhood, and for many years afterwards, it never occurred
to me that there was anything in my habits, thoughts, and actions,
different from those of others of my age; OWEN-1857-2,1,4.78

but when looking back and comparing my life with many others, I have been
induced to attribute any favorable difference to the effects produced at
the early period when my life was endangered by the spoonful of scalding
flummery.  Because from that time I was compelled to notice the effects
produced by different kinds of food on my constitution, which had been
also deeply injured in its powers of digestion.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.79

I could not eat and drink as others of my age, OWEN-1857-2,1,4.80

and I was thus compelled to live in some respects the life of a hermit
as regards temperance.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.81

I entered however into the amusements of those of my own standing,
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.82

and followed the games played by boys at that period in that part
of the country, - such as marbles, hand and foot ball, &c.
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.83

I also attended the dancing school for some time, OWEN-1857-2,1,4.84

and in all these games and exercises I excelled not only those of my
own age, but those two or three years older, OWEN-1857-2,1,4.85

and I was so active that I was the best runner and leaper, both as to
height and distance, in the school.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.86

I attempted also to learn music, and to play upon the clarionet,
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.87

and during my noviciate, as my father's house was in the middle of
the principal $street {TEXT:stree}, I fear I must have annoyed all the
neighbourhood, OWEN-1857-2,1,4.88

- for my"God Save the King"and similar tunes were heard almost all over
the town.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.89

But I do not recollect that any formal complaint was ever made.
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.90

I was too much of a favorite with the whole town for my benefit,
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.91

and was often pitted against my equals, and sometimes against my
superiors in age, - sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another.
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.92

I have often reflected since how unjust such proceedings are in principle
, and how injurious in practice.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.93

One instance of this made a deep impression on my mind.
OWEN-1857-2,1,4.94

Some party bet with another that I could write better than my next eldest
brother, John, who was two years older; OWEN-1857-2,1,4.95

and upon a formal trial, at which judges were appointed, it was decided
that my writing was the better, although as far as I could then form an
opinion I thought my brother's was as good as my own.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.96

From that day I do not think my brother had as strong an affection for
me as he had before this unwise competition.  OWEN-1857-2,1,4.97

I have said that such competitions are unjust, because, as no two
organisations are the same, there can be no just comparison <P_1,5>
between the competing efforts of any two individuals, - while the
successful one is thus taught vanity, and the unsuccessful, jealousy
and hatred.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.98

When between six and eight years of age, I was often a visitor at Parson
Drake's, of the Rowe, who was the rector or vicar of an adjoining parish
- OWEN-1857-2,1,5.99

I think it was the parish with the name of which I have often amused
myself with my English, Scotch, and other friends, by asking them,
when speaking of it, to pronounce it after my spelling it, or to spell
it after my pronunciation.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.100

This puzzling name is spelled thus, Llanllwchaioin.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.101

Those accustomed to it can easily pronounce it; but not those who
are unacquainted with Welsh names and the mode of spelling them.
OWEN-1857-2,1,5.102

This clergyman was a direct descendant of Admiral Drake,
OWEN-1857-2,1,5.103

and was very eccentric as a minister.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.104

He took me to church with him on a sunday after he had had a difference
with the squire of the parish, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.105

and to my surprise and the astonishment of the congregation he gave a most
severe personal lecture to the squire during his sermon, - so personal and
severe, that before its conclusion the squire, who was present with his
family, became extremely uneasy in his very conspicuous pew, and at length
prepared to leave it, when Mr. Drake stopped, and looking towards
him, said,"$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} be in a hurry, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.106

I shall have done soon OWEN-1857-2,1,5.107

and you had better sit quiet. "OWEN-1857-2,1,5.108

This scene made a deep impression upon me, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.109

and never left my memory.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.110

About this period also a young gentleman, a Mr. James Donne,
who was studying for the church, either at Oxford or at Cambridge,
came upon a visit to Newtown during a vacation, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.111

and I became his every day companion.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.112

He was then about nineteen OWEN-1857-2,1,5.113

and I was between eight and nine.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.114

The country around Newtown is I believe generally considered to be
interesting and beautiful, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.115

and Mr. Donne and myself, while he remained upon his visit,
rambled about the woods and lanes and higher grounds to examine the
scenery in all directions.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.116

These excursions with a man of his cultivated taste and superior
conversation awakened in me a sense of pleasure which I ever afterwards
experienced in observing nature in its every variety - a pleasure which
as I advanced in years continued and increased.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.117

The friendship thus commenced, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.118

strengthened with our years, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.119

and continued to the death of Mr. Donne, who became well known
and highly respected as Dr. Donne of Oswestry.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.120

We had much correspondence, OWEN-1857-2,1,5.121

and when I had aroused the thinking faculties of the civilised world by
the great public meetings which I held in the City of London Tavern in
1817, I was surprised by receiving a letter from my much valued friend,
Dr. Donne, to inform me that he had taken a pleasant task upon
himself, which was to trace my pedigree, and had discovered that I was
a regular descendant from the Princes of North Wales.  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.122

Good man!  OWEN-1857-2,1,5.123

I have no doubt he thought it was information that would <P_1,6> gratify
me, and that therefore he had taken all that trouble.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.124

But being at that time occupied with great public questions and extensive
private business, I neglected this private affair, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.125

and never made the least enquiry respecting it, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.126

and I am afraid, owing to these circumstances, that I never made any
suitable acknowledgement for the kindness intended.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.127

During the school holidays I was in the habit of visiting my
relations , who were farmers living at no great distance from Newtown.
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.128

Among these I remember three.  Turners of Penarth, Goodwins of the Court,
and Williams of Vaynor, but afterwards of Old Hall near Kerry, a village
three or four miles from Newtown.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.129

The two first named were married to sisters of my mother, as I now
conjecture; OWEN-1857-2,1,6.130

the third was brother to my mother, and I believe her only brother living
at that period.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.131

My most frequent visits was to this family, in which was an only child,
a son named Richard after his father, and one year younger than myself.
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.132

We were always great friends, much attached to each other and delighted
to be together.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.133

My cousin had the finest natural qualities I have ever seen in any youth
, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.134

and he had received a superior education for the time and for the locality
in which his father resided.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.135

He had been sent to a distant boarding school.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.136

Although a year younger, he was much my superior in almost everything -
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.137

for in whatever he attempted he far excelled all of his age.
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.138

And yet what he did was done in a quiet manner without apparent effort.
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.139

He seemed to be unconscious of his own extraordinary powers.
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.140

The Williamses, as I have said, were naturally a superior family of
their class, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.141

and the mother of my cousin was one of the best of women I ever saw in
her rank of life.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.142

Every one who knew her, loved her, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.143

and every one liked to enjoy the hospitality of the family, which was well
known over the country to a considerable distance.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.144

Our grandfather lived with them until he was upwards of ninety,
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.145

and one of my earliest recollections is the sight of this old man sitting
by the fire in his son's house.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.146

My cousin and I read and thought much, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.147

and yet we were both generally very active.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.148

But one very hot day in hay-harvest time we felt ourselves, being
over-clothed, quite overcome with heat while we sauntered from the house
towards a large field where numerous hay-makers were actively at work.
OWEN-1857-2,1,6.149

They appeared to us, who had been doing nothing and yet were overcome
with heat, to be cool and comfortable.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.150

I said"Richard!  how is this?  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.151

These active workpeople are not heated, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.152

but are pleasantly cool, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.153

and do not suffer as we do from the heat.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.154

There must be some secret in this.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.155

Let us try to find it out.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.156

Let us do exactly as they do, and work with them. "OWEN-1857-2,1,6.157

He willingly agreed.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.158

I was, I suppose, between nine and ten years of age, OWEN-1857-2,1,6.159

and he was between eight and nine.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.160

We observed that all the men were without their coats and waistcoats,
and had their shirts open.  OWEN-1857-2,1,6.161

We adopted the same <P_1,7> practice, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.162

- procured the lightest rakes and forks - OWEN-1857-2,1,7.163

for both were used occasionally, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.164

- and Richard and I, unburthened of our heavy clothing, led the field
for several hours, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.165

and were cooler and less fatigued than when we were idle and wasting
our time.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.166

This became ever afterwards a good <font> experience <$$font> and <font>
lesson <$$font> to both; OWEN-1857-2,1,7.167

for we found ourselves much more comfortable with active employment than
when we were idle.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.168

My cousin grew up the finest young man in the whole country round - a lion
in strength, active and courageous far beyond all his fellows , excelling
in everything which he undertook, but yet quiet and unpretending, and
beloved by all who knew him.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.169

It always occurred to me that had he been favourably placed in superior
society, he would have made a second and perhaps a superior"Admirable
Crichton. "OWEN-1857-2,1,7.170

Being an only child, and such a child, he was doated upon by his parents,
OWEN-1857-2,1,7.171

and he was at all times, instead of being spoiled by such affection,
a most obedient and attentive son to them.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.172

But a single error of his father, who was obstinate in abiding by what
he deemed just, destroyed the high promise of this fine human being.
OWEN-1857-2,1,7.173

He fell in love, and deeply in love, with a cousin of his mother's family,
- in all ways his equal in station and property, and also an only child.
OWEN-1857-2,1,7.174

The fathers of the two lovers could not agree regarding the fortune to
be given to each.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.175

Richard's father could give and was willing to give his son a sum at
that time considered large to commence life with, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.176

and he wished the father of the young lady to advance an equal sum,
as he thought he could well afford it.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.177

But the latter either could not then, or would not agree to the terms
proposed; OWEN-1857-2,1,7.178

and on this my cousin's father, anxious for his son's pecuniary standing
in society, refused his consent to the marriage, except on the terms he
thought just.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.179

Thus was destroyed the permanent happiness of his son, who was too fond
of his parents to act in opposition to their wishes, and too high spirited
to complain.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.180

A coolness arose between the families.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.181

Richard suffered more than any one suspected.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.182

His feelings were strongly affected, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.183

but the obstinacy of his father was immoveable, having once declared
his determination.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.184

The son, who had previously been an example of temperance, began to
change in this habit, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.185

- gradually became intemperate, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.186

and died prematurely, a victim to the disappointment of his affections;
another warning to parents not unreasonably to interfere with the settled
affections of their children.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.187

While the families were estranged, the young lady married,
OWEN-1857-2,1,7.188

and shortly afterwards she became heir to a relative, who left her forty
thousand pounds.  OWEN-1857-2,1,7.189

These particulars were given to me too late for interference,
OWEN-1857-2,1,7.190

or, as I had influence with my uncle and aunt, I might perhaps have
given a very different result to these unfortunate proceedings.
OWEN-1857-2,1,7.191

There was a strong early imbibed affection between my cousin and myself
, OWEN-1857-2,1,7.192

and many years after, while I was directing Mr. Drinkwater's
establishment, I <P_1,8> felt a great inclination to send for him to
take part in it; OWEN-1857-2,1,8.193

for among his other qualifications he had an extraordinary genius for
mechanical inventions, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.194

and he would have made a splendid engineer.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.195

I was withheld from following my inclination by the consideration that
he was an only son, the stay of his parents, - that he was already in
an independent position through the property of those parents, and that
their separation might be painful to all the parties.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.196

When however I had been informed of the previous proceedings, I regretted
that I had not induced my cousin to join me; as when I was 24 years of
age, and he was 23, I could have given him the situation which I held
at five hundred a year.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.197

But it was not to be, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.198

for the influence of circumstance prevented it.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.199

But to return to my early life.  I have narrated my narrow escape from
being killed by the scalding of my stomach.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.200

Shortly before this event, I was doing something with the key-hole of a
large door in a passage between my father's house and that of our next
neighbour, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.201

and by some means I got one of my fingers fast in the key-hole,
OWEN-1857-2,1,8.202

and in my attempt to get it out it was twisted so painfully that I
fainted, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.203

and I know not how it came loose, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.204

for I was found in a swoon lying on the ground.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.205

On another occasion my life was periled, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.206

and I again escaped without knowing how.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.207

Newtown is situated on the banks of the river Severn, over which at
that time there was a bridge that had been erected many years before,
of wood.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.208

It admitted of a wagon way with a narrow footpath on each side.
OWEN-1857-2,1,8.209

My father had a favorite cream coloured mare, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.210

and her pasture fields were on the side of this bridge opposite to where
we lived.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.211

When my father required this mare, as it was a favorite of mine also,
I frequently went for it to the field, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.212

and rode it home, although a young horseman, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.213

for at this period I was only six or seven years old.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.214

One day when returning from the field mounted on this mare, I was passing
homeward over the bridge, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.215

but before I was half over, a wagon had made some progress from the
opposite side.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.216

There was not room for me to pass without my legs coming in contact
with the wheels of this wagon or with the rails of the bridge.
OWEN-1857-2,1,8.217

I had not sense enough to turn back, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.218

and endeavoured to pass the wagon.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.219

I soon found that my leg was in danger of being grazed by the wheels,
OWEN-1857-2,1,8.220

and I threw it over the saddle, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.221

and in consequence I fell on the opposite side, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.222

but in falling I was so alarmed lest I should drop into the river
or should strike against the bridge, that I lost all recollection.
OWEN-1857-2,1,8.223

How I escaped I know not; OWEN-1857-2,1,8.224

but on recovering I found myself on the footpath of the bridge, the mare
standing quietly near me, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.225

and the wagon had fairly passed, OWEN-1857-2,1,8.226

and I was unhurt.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.227

Since that occurrence I have always felt a more especial liking for
cream colored horses than for any others.  OWEN-1857-2,1,8.228

Our next neighbours were two maiden ladies of the name of Tilsley,
OWEN-1857-2,1,8.229

and they kept a superior country shop for the sale of <P_1,9> drapery and
haberdashery on one side, and groceries on the other.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.230

One of these ladies changed her situation by marrying a Mr. Moore
, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.231

and as he enlarged the business so as to add a wholesale branch to their
former retail trade, they required more assistance, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.232

and as I was active, it was supposed I could be useful to them,
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.233

and my services were borrowed, at first on market and fair days;
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.234

and as I had then been two years in the capacity of usher, learning
nothing but how to teach, Mr. Moore requested my father to permit
me to be with them every day in the week, instead of, as hitherto,
on their more busy days only; OWEN-1857-2,1,9.235

and thus I was occupied for one year, but living in my own family.
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.236

Having by this period read much of other countries and other proceedings,
and, with my habits of reflection and extreme temperance, not liking
the habits and manners of a small country town, I began to desire a
different field of action, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.237

and wished my parents to permit me to go to London.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.238

I was at this time about nine years and half old; OWEN-1857-2,1,9.239

and at length, although I was a great favorite at home, it was promised
that when I should attain my tenth year I should be allowed to go.
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.240

This promise satisfied me in the meantime, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.241

and I continued to gain knowledge of the business in which I was
occupied, - continuing also to read and to take lessons in dancing.
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.242

During the period I remained giving this friendly assistance to Mr.
Moore, a ludicrous circumstance occurred, which left an impression which
vividly remains.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.243

The parents of one of my schoolfellows, who was about my own age, kept
a grocer's shop in the town.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.244

Their stock of molasses, an article then much in demand, was exhausted ,
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.245

and as Mr. Moore kept a wholesale supply of it, my schoolfellow,
whose name was John Stanley, came with a tub with two upright handles,
to purchase as much as the tub would hold.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.246

The wholesale stock was kept in a cellar below the shop,
OWEN-1857-2,1,9.247

and the entrance to this cellar was through a trap-door in the centre
of the shop floor, and down the steps of a ladder.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.248

John had filled the tub quite full, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.249

and was bringing it up the ladder on his head, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.250

and on reaching the level of the floor, one of the handles of the tub
came in contact with part of the floor, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.251

and the tub was upset, the molasses running over his head, which was
uncovered, except with very thick hair.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.252

The molasses ran down over the whole of his clothes and person, making
him one of the most laughable and at the same time pitiable figures that
the imagination could paint.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.253

How he got rid of the nuisance when he arrived at home must be conjectured
, OWEN-1857-2,1,9.254

- but the disaster was always remembered to his annoyance by our
neighbours as long as I remained in Newtown.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.255

I mentioned that I continued to take lessons in dancing, of which I was
fond, until my departure from home.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.256

It was at these lessons that I first became conscious of the natural
sympathies and dislikes or jealousies of children.  OWEN-1857-2,1,9.257

I was esteemed the <P_1,10> best dancer of my class, OWEN-1857-2,1,10.258

and at this period I was in the first class.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.259

The contest for partners among the girls was often amusing, but sometimes
really distressing.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.260

The feelings of some of them if they could not obtain the partners
they liked were so overpowering, that it was afflicting to see how much
they suffered.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.261

I have long thought that the mind and feelings of young children
are seldom duly considered or attended to, and that if adults would
patiently encourage them to express candidly what they thought and felt,
much suffering would be saved to the children, and much useful knowledge
of human nature would be gained by the adults.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.262

I am now conscious there was much real suffering in that dancing room,
which, had there been more knowledge of human nature in the dancing
master and in the parents of the children, might have been avoided.
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.263

The time had now drawn near for my departure from my parental roof,
and for me to undertake a journey which in the then state of the roads
was thought formidable for grown persons.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.264

From Shrewsbury I was to travel alone to London, inexperienced as I
then was.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.265

At that time I knew and was known to every man, woman, and child in the
town, OWEN-1857-2,1,10.266

and I called upon and took my leave of every one; OWEN-1857-2,1,10.267

and I received many a keep-sake, and from the more wealthy, presents
of money.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.268

I deemed myself, at ten years of age, amply provided to seek my fortune
with forty shillings - the expenses of my coach hire being paid for me.
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.269

I may remark here that for two years or perhaps more before I left home
, my parents used to consult me when any matter of importance was to be
decided, but I did not know why they asked my opinion, and was unconscious
that I could give any useful advice.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.270

Before proceeding to narrate my journey I may state, that I was never
but once corrected by my parents.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.271

This correction took place under the following circumstances, and when
I was, I think, scarcely seven years old.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.272

I was always desirous to meet the wishes of both my parents,
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.273

and never refused to do whatever they asked me to do.
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.274

One day my mother indistinctly said something to me to which I supposed
the proper answer was'no,'OWEN-1857-2,1,10.275

- and in my usual way I said'no', - supposing I was meeting her wishes.
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.276

Not understanding me, and supposing that I refused her request,
she immediately, and to me rather sharply, - for her custom was
to speak kindly to me, - said"What!  $Wo $n't {TEXT:Won't} you?
"OWEN-1857-2,1,10.277

Having said'no,'I thought if I said'yes, I will,'I should be contradicting
myself, and should be expressing a falsehood, OWEN-1857-2,1,10.278

and I said again'no,'but without any idea of disobeying her.
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.279

If she had then patiently and calmly enquired what my thoughts
and feelings were, a proper understanding would have arisen,
OWEN-1857-2,1,10.280

and everything would have proceeded as usual.  OWEN-1857-2,1,10.281

But my mother, not comprehending my thoughts and feelings, spoke still
more sharply and angrily, OWEN-1857-2,1,10.282

- for I had never previously disobeyed her, OWEN-1857-2,1,10.283

<P_1,11>

and she was no doubt greatly surprised and annoyed when I repeated that
I would not.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.285

My mother never chastised any of us, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.286

- this was left for my father to do, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.287

and my brothers and sisters occasionally felt a whip which was kept to
maintain order among the children, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.288

but I had never previously been touched with it.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.289

My father was called in, and my refusal stated.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.290

I was again asked if I would do what my mother required,
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.291

and I said firmly'no,'OWEN-1857-2,1,11.292

and I then felt the whip every time after I refused when asked if I
would yield and do what was required.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.293

I said'no'every time I was so asked, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.294

and at length said quietly but firmly -"you may kill me,
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.295

but I will not do it"- OWEN-1857-2,1,11.296

and this decided the contest.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.297

There was no attempt ever afterwards to correct me; OWEN-1857-2,1,11.298

but this difference was soon made up on both sides, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.299

and I continued to be the favorite I had always been.
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.300

From my own feelings, which I well remember when a child, I am convinced
that very often punishment is not only useless, but very pernicious,
and injurious to the punisher and punished.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.301

Though alone in going to London, I was not to be alone when I arrived
there.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.302

My eldest brother, William, had been brought up by my father to his own
business, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.303

and when out of his apprenticeship, and after he had subsequently
worked some years with my father, he decided to go to London, when he
was between twenty and thirty, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.304

and he there obtained a situation with a Mr. Reynolds, a saddler,
who then lived at No. 84, High Holborn.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.305

To him I was consigned, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.306

for by this time Mr. Reynolds had died, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.307

and my brother had taken the business OWEN-1857-2,1,11.308

and had married the widow.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.309

<heading>

Leaving Home.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.311

<$$heading>

My father took me to Welshpool, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.313

and thence I went to take coach for London at Shrewsbury, which was then
the nearest place to Newtown to which there was any public conveyance
to go to London.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.314

The coach left Shrewsbury at night, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.315

and an outside place had been taken for me, with the expectation that
I might travel inside during the night.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.316

The proprietor, who knew my family, was going to put me inside, when
some ill-tempered man, who had discovered that I had paid only for an
outside place, refused to allow me to enter.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.317

It was dark, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.318

and I could not see the objector, nor discover how crowded the coach
might be; OWEN-1857-2,1,11.319

- for coaches then carried six inside.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.320

I was glad afterwards that I did not know who this man was;
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.321

and I never discovered him, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.322

and therefore I could not be angry with him, as I should have been,
for refusing admission to a child.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.323

I then had not fully learned the principles of the formation of
character, and the influences of circumstances over all that have life ,
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.324

or I should not have been angry or surprised at such conduct.
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.325

I arrived safely in London, OWEN-1857-2,1,11.326

and was heartily welcomed by my brother, who was always partial to me,
OWEN-1857-2,1,11.327

and his wife received me very kindly.  OWEN-1857-2,1,11.328

<P_1,12>

My father had written respecting me to his friend, a Mr.
Heptinstall, of No. 6 Ludgate Hill, who was a large dealer in
lace foreign and British; OWEN-1857-2,1,12.330

and Mr. Moore had written in my favor to Mr. Tilsley,
of No. 100 Newgate Street, who then kept what was deemed a large
draper's shop.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.331

This was in 1781.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.332

I think I had been on this visit to my brother nearly six weeks, when
Mr. Heptinstall procured me a situation with a Mr. James
McGuffog, of whom he spoke highly as carrying on a large business for
a provincial town, in Stamford, Lincolnshire.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.333

The terms offered to me were for three years - the first without pay,
the second with a salary of eight pounds, and the third with ten pounds,
and with board, lodging, and washing, in the house.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.334

These terms I accepted, OWEN-1857-2,1,12.335

and being well found with clothes to serve me more than a year, I from
that period, ten years of age, maintained myself without ever applying
to my parents for any additional aid.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.336

<heading>

My Residence with Mr. McGuffog.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.338

<$$heading>

I left my brother's house in London, OWEN-1857-2,1,12.340

and arrived at Stamford, where I found Mr. McGuffog's establishment
all that was stated, and his house respectable and comfortable.
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.341

This was a most fortunate introduction for me into active life.
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.342

Mr. James McGuffog was a Scotchman, thoroughly honest, and a
good man of business, - very methodical, kind, and liberal, and much
respected by his neighbours and customers, and also, for his punctuality
and good sense, by those from whom he purchased his goods for sale;
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.343

and I was fortunate in obtaining such a man for my first master.
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.344

He told me that he had commenced life in Scotland with half a crown,
laid it out in the purchase of some things for sale, and hawked them
in a basket.  That by degrees he changed his basket for a pack, with
which he travelled the country, acquiring knowledge through experience,
and increasing his stock until he got, first a horse, and then a horse
and covered van.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.345

He made his regular rounds among customers of the first respectability in
Lincolnshire and the adjoining counties, until he was requested by the
nobility and principal families and farmers around Stamford, to open
an establishment there for the sale of the best and finest articles
of female wear, for which, for some time in his travelling capacity,
he had become celebrated.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.346

When I came to his house he had been some years established in it,
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.347

and was beginning to be so independent that he made all his purchases
with ready money and was becoming wealthy.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.348

He had married a daughter of a well doing middle class person,
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.349

and they appeared to live on very good terms with each other,
OWEN-1857-2,1,12.350

and both were industrious, always attending to their business, yet
respectable at all times in their persons, and altogether superior as
retail tradespeople, being quite the aristocracy of that class, without
its usual weak vanities.  OWEN-1857-2,1,12.351

They had at this time an assistant of <P_1,13> the name of Sloane, about
thirty-five years of age, a bachelor; and also a youth about my own age,
nephew to McGuffog.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.352

Here I was at once installed as a member of the family,
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.353

and during my stay with them I was treated more like their own child
than as a stranger come from afar.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.354

I was by Mr. McGuffog carefully initiated into the routine of the
business, and instructed in its detail, so as to accustom me to great
order and accuracy.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.355

The business was carried on under a well-considered system, which in
its results was very successful.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.356

I suppose I was considered industrious and attentive to my instructions
, OWEN-1857-2,1,13.357

for I was seldom found fault with or unpleasantly spoken to by either
Mr. or Mrs. McGuffog - the latter often attending to
the business.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.358

The articles dealt in were of the best, finest, and most choice
qualities that could be procured from all the markets of the world;
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.359

for many of the customers of the establishment were among the highest
nobility in the kingdom, OWEN-1857-2,1,13.360

and often six or seven carriages belonging to them were at the same time
in attendance at the premises.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.361

Mr. McGuffog's shop had become a kind of general rendezvous of
the higher class nobility.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.362

Among the frequenters of the house as customers were the families of
Burleigh, Westmoreland, Lowther, Ancaster, Browton, Noel, Trollope,
and many whose names I have forgotten.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.363

I had thus an opportunity of noticing the manners of these parties, and
of studying their characters when they were under the least restraint.
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.364

I thus also became familiar with the finest fabrics of a great variety
of manufactures, many of which required great delicacy in handling and
care in keeping from being injured.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.365

These circumstances, trivial as they may appear, were of essential
service to me in after life, when I became a manufacturer and commercial
man upon a large scale; OWEN-1857-2,1,13.366

for they prepared me in some measure for the future intercourse I had
with what is called the great world.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.367

Mr. McGuffog was much respected by these parties for his honesty
and plain dealing, OWEN-1857-2,1,13.368

and was the country banker for the then Sir William Lowther, afterwards
the late Earl of Lonsdale, and who, with Lady Augusta Lowther and
family, were among the most constant frequenters of the establishment.
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.369

After I left Stamford I learned from Mr. McGuffog that Sir William
had made him a present of one of his favorite hunters, and that Mr.
McGuffog, after retiring from business, often hunted with Sir William's
hounds; OWEN-1857-2,1,13.370

and he remained a favorite with every one to his death.
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.371

Mr. McGuffog had a well selected library, which I freely used;
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.372

for our chief business was from ten in the morning to four in the
afternoon, OWEN-1857-2,1,13.373

and while I remained in Stamford I read upon the average about five
hours a day.  OWEN-1857-2,1,13.374

One of the entrances to Burleigh Park was near the town;
OWEN-1857-2,1,13.375

and in summer, and as long as the weather permitted, my chief
pleasure <P_1,14> was to go early into the park to walk, read, think
, and study, in those noble avenues which were then numerous in it.
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.376

Very often in the midst of summer I was thus in the park from between
three and four in the morning until eight, and again in the evening from
six or seven until nearly dark.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.377

I had transcribed many of Seneca's moral precepts into a book which I
kept in my pocket; OWEN-1857-2,1,14.378

to ponder over them in the park was one of my pleasureable occupations;
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.379

and in this park, which I made my study, I read many volumes of the most
useful works I could obtain.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.380

At the early hour mentioned the only one I used to see taking his
first walk for the day, was the Earl of Exeter, the uncle, I believe,
of his successor who married the miller's daughter, the subject of
Tennyson's exquisite poem, and who was the father of the present Marquis.
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.381

This old Earl's habits were peculiar.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.382

He never allowed himself to sleep a second time in one night.
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.383

At whatever hour he awoke, winter and summer, he rose,
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.384

and in bad weather he went to his study, OWEN-1857-2,1,14.385

and walked when it was fine, OWEN-1857-2,1,14.386

and at four o'clock in the morning I have often seen him at his early
exercise.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.387

He was also so punctual in his habits that he had the first dish of his
dinner passing between the kitchen and dining room as the first stroke
of the clock struck three, and he never waited for anyone who was absent
or who had not arrived at his time.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.388

But he was much respected and liked by all about him.
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.389

I often recur to the recollection of the many happy healthy
hours I enjoyed in that park - healthy both to body and mind.
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.390

Frequently in the morning I hailed the rising sun, OWEN-1857-2,1,14.391

and in the evening watched its setting and the rising of the moon.
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.392

In the second year of my apprenticeship our circle was increased
in the house by the addition of a sister and a niece of Mrs.
McGuffog's - the first about nineteen, and the second about ten years
old, OWEN-1857-2,1,14.393

and our pleasure was increased; OWEN-1857-2,1,14.394

for there was a mutual good feeling among all the members of the family,
except that the old bachelor, David Sloane, was the least satisfied
with himself and others, and seemed jealous of the general kindness
shown to me by all the members of the family, and of the preference to
be served by me shown by many of the regular customers when they could
make a choice between us.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.395

He was penurious in his habits and somewhat more selfish than is suitable
for creating friends.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.396

A ludicrous instance occurred to make these failings, which he could
not avoid, somewhat conspicuous.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.397

He slept in a room adjoining the wholesale department,
OWEN-1857-2,1,14.398

and occasionally, when it was full and over stocked, some of the surplus
was occasionally put into his room, OWEN-1857-2,1,14.399

and at the time of the event narrated, some fine and expensive articles
happened to be placed on a table in his room.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.400

He was very careful of his clothes, OWEN-1857-2,1,14.401

and took pleasure in preserving their new appearance as long as
practicable.  OWEN-1857-2,1,14.402

He had just brought a new pair of <P_1,15> breeches - OWEN-1857-2,1,15.403

for pantaloons had not then been introduced, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.404

- and in going to bed he put them on the table where these goods were
placed.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.405

On going into bed he had put out his light in such a manner that the
sparks or snuffing of the candle had fallen unperceived by him among
these goods, and near to his own new purchase.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.406

He fell asleep, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.407

and some of the articles upon the table were burnt, and among them
David's new purchase, except some of the buttons and some fragments.
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.408

The smell of fire soon aroused Mr. and Mrs. McGuffog,
who immediately raised the alarm, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.409

and all hastily arose in their night clothes.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.410

The smoke was discovered to issue from David's room, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.411

and on bursting open the door, David, who was asleep, hastily awoke.
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.412

The burning articles upon the table disclosed the cause of alarm,
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.413

and water was immediately procured $and {TEXT:aud} the fire soon put out.
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.414

When the danger was over, all the parties began to look at each other,
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.415

- but David was the conspicuous figure.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.416

In his night shirt and coloured night-cap he stood by the table, looking
most wofully, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.417

and taking up fragment after fragment of his burnt clothing, -
regardless of the danger which he had created, and of the loss sustained
by Mr. McGuffog through the goods which were burnt or spoiled
with the water, - he ejaculated, as he held up each piece or button,
"Oh my new breeches!  - Oh my new breeches! "OWEN-1857-2,1,15.418

and this for some time was all that could be obtained from him when
questioned as to the origin of the fire, until at length the scene became
so farcical and ludicrous that no one could avoid laughing at him,
and he was left, looking most miserable, to his own reflections until
the morning.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.419

But, poor fellow, -"Oh my new breeches! "was never afterwards forgotten,
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.420

and it was a joke which at length none but those who desired to torment
him would recall to his remembrance.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.421

Many years afterwards, when we were both advanced in life, I met him in
Manchester, when, with great agitation taking me cordially by the hand,
he said with extraordinary earnestness, -"Will you forgive me the injuries
I have formerly done you? "OWEN-1857-2,1,15.422

I said"I do not know of any injury I ever experienced from you,
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.423

and therefore I have nothing to forgive.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.424

-"Yes,"he said,"you have, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.425

and it has often made me very unhappy, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.426

- and do say you forgive me. "OWEN-1857-2,1,15.427

"Whatever it may be, I know nothing of it, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.428

- but if it can be of any satisfaction to you, I forgive you with all
my heart, without wishing to know in what way you suppose the injury
was done to me. "OWEN-1857-2,1,15.429

The poor fellow seemed quite relieved from a burden upon his mind,
OWEN-1857-2,1,15.430

and left me with a gratified countenance, again shaking me cordially by
the hand.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.431

Mr. McGuffog was of the church of Scotland, Mrs. McGuffog
of the church of England, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.432

and they agreed to go in the morning to the service of the one, and in
the afternoon to that of the other, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.433

and they always took me with them.  OWEN-1857-2,1,15.434

I listened to the contending sermons, OWEN-1857-2,1,15.435

for they were often, and indeed most generally, either in reference
<P_1,16> to their own sectarian notions, or in opposition to some of
the opposing sects.  OWEN-1857-2,1,16.436

But during the four years I remained with Mr. and Mrs.
McGuffog, I never knew a religious difference between them.
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.437

I was all this time endeavouring to find out <font> the true religion,
<$$font> OWEN-1857-2,1,16.438

and was greatly puzzled for some time by finding all of every sect over
the world, of which I read, or of which I heard from the pulpits, claim
each for themselves to be in possession of <font> the true religion.
<$$font> OWEN-1857-2,1,16.439

I studied, and studied, OWEN-1857-2,1,16.440

and carefully compared one with another, OWEN-1857-2,1,16.441

for I was very religiously inclined, OWEN-1857-2,1,16.442

and desired most anxiously to be in the right way.  OWEN-1857-2,1,16.443

But the more I heard, read, and reflected, the more I became
dissatisfied with Christian, Jew, Mahomedan, Hindoo, Chinese, and Pagan.
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.444

I began seriously to study the foundation of all of them, and to ascertain
on what principle they were based.  OWEN-1857-2,1,16.445

Before my investigations were concluded, I was satisfied that one and
all had emanated from the same source, and their varieties from the same
false imaginations of our early ancestors; imaginations formed when men
were ignorant of their own nature, were devoid of experience, and were
governed by their random conjectures, which were almost always, at first,
like their notions of the fixedness of the earth, far from the truth.
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.446

It was with the greatest reluctance, and after long contests in my mind,
that I was compelled to abandon my first and deep rooted impressions in
favour of Christianity, OWEN-1857-2,1,16.447

- but being obliged to give up my faith in this sect, I was at the same
time compelled to reject all others, OWEN-1857-2,1,16.448

for I had discovered that all had been based on the same absurd
imagination,"that each one formed his own qualities, - determined his
own thoughts, will, and action, - and was responsible for them to God
and to his fellowmen. "OWEN-1857-2,1,16.449

My own reflections compelled me to come to very different conclusions.
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.450

My reason taught me that I could not have made one of my own qualities,
- that they were forced upon me by Nature; - that my language, religion,
and habits, were forced upon me by Society; and that I was entirely
the child of Nature and Society; - that Nature gave the qualities,
and Society directed them.  OWEN-1857-2,1,16.451

Thus was I forced, through seeing the error of their foundation, to
abandon all belief in every religion which had been taught to man.
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.452

But my religious feelings were immediately replaced by the spirit of
universal charity, - not for a sect or a party, or for a country or a
colour, - but for the human race, and with a real and ardent desire to
do them good.  OWEN-1857-2,1,16.453

Before, however, I had advanced so far in knowledge, while I was yet
a Christian, and was impressed with the sacredness of the Christian
Sabbath, it seemed to me that in Stamford it was much disregarded,
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.454

- and it came into my head, at the age of twelve or thirteen, to write
upon the subject to Mr. Pitt, who was then Prime Minister.
OWEN-1857-2,1,16.455

In my letter to him I stated the desecration which was going forward in
Stamford, OWEN-1857-2,1,16.456

and expressed a hope <P_1,17> that Government would adopt some measure
to enforce a better observance of the Sabbath.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.457

I had been sometime writing this letter, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.458

and after I had sent it through the post office Mr. and Mrs.
M'Guffog {COM:sic} asked me what I had been so interested about.
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.459

I said"I have been writing a letter to Mr. Pitt. "
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.460

"To Mr. Pitt! "they exclaimed with some astonishment -
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.461

"What could you have to say to Mr. Pitt? "OWEN-1857-2,1,17.462

I said it was about the Sabbath being so shamefully employed as it was
by many in Stamford, some of whom even kept their shops open on that day.
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.463

They looked at each other OWEN-1857-2,1,17.464

and smiled; OWEN-1857-2,1,17.465

- but at the time I thought there was nothing extraordinary in it.
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.466

In about eight or ten days afterwards, Mr. McGoffog brought a
London newspaper, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.467

and said to me, -"Here is an answer to your letter to Mr. Pitt.
"OWEN-1857-2,1,17.468

I expected no answer, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.469

and was taken by surprise, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.470

and blushed very much.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.471

I asked what was the answer - OWEN-1857-2,1,17.472

he said it was"a long proclamation from the goverment, recommending all
parties to keep the Sabbath more strictly. "OWEN-1857-2,1,17.473

I was of course quite gratified, having no doubt my letter had produced
that result; when, no doubt, such a letter as I could then have written
would be opened and put into the waste paper basket, and would never be
heard of by Mr. Pitt.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.474

My letter going at that period must have been a mere coincidence;
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.475

for the proclamation, as far as I can recollect, was a formal well
considered document of the government, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.476

and probably had been determined upon before my letter was in the
post office.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.477

It however pleased me at the time, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.478

and amazed Mr. and Mrs. McGuffog.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.479

After my three years had expired, Mr. McGuffog wished me to
remain with him, and to continue as an assistant for a year longer.
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.480

During this period I had acquired as much knowledge of the business in
which I was engaged as the situation afforded, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.481

and although I had lived most happily in this family, and could have
remained as long as I liked, my wishes were for the attainment of more
knowledge and an enlarged field of action.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.482

I therefore, reluctantly, on account of the kindness I had uniformly
experienced from Mr. and Mrs. McGuffog and their relatives,
expressed my desire to return to London.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.483

Very friendly offers were made to detain me; OWEN-1857-2,1,17.484

but my determination was fixed, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.485

and with strong recommendations from Mr. McGuffog, I returned
to my brother's house in London, now between fourteen and fifteen years
of age.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.486

While I remained in Stamford, I never saw any one whom I had previously
known; OWEN-1857-2,1,17.487

- but one day, as I was passing the Goerge Inn, the principal hotel in the
place, I saw a person at the entrance talking to a gentleman , and who was
so like my father, that I concluded it must be he, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.488

and while the conversation continued I walked past them
OWEN-1857-2,1,17.489

and returned several times, being more and more convinced it must be
my father.  OWEN-1857-2,1,17.490

At length the conversation terminated, OWEN-1857-2,1,17.491

and I then came very near to my supposed father, so as to catch his eye
and <P_1,18> draw his attention to me, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.492

but there was no sign of recognition on his part, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.493

and it was only from that circumstance that I discovered my mistake,
OWEN-1857-2,1,18.494

for the likeness still appeared to me perfect.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.495

My disappointment may be easily imagined.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.496

Having been so long absent from my relations and friends, I was glad to
spend some months with my brother William, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.497

for there was always a strong attachment between us; OWEN-1857-2,1,18.498

and I spent some time in seeing the sights of London, and becoming
acquainted with its principal localities, walking in the parks, and
particularly in Kensington Gardens on fine Sundays with my brother and
his wife.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.499

It was at this period I visited my parents and relatives in Wales.
OWEN-1857-2,1,18.500

I spent some time with my family in Newtown, and with my relatives in
the neighourhood.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.501

I was uncommonly well received by all parties, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.502

and spent some time with my cousin and former companion Richard Williams ,
who was then living at his father's new purchase of Old Hall, near Kerry,
Montgomeryshire.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.503

I also visited my sister in Radnorshire, who had married a Mr.
Davis.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.504

My stay in Wales was but for a short period, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.505

for I was anxious to be again in business, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.506

and my funds required my expenses to be limited.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.507

I therefore returned to my brother's house in London, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.508

and only once afterwards to the present time have visited Newtown.
OWEN-1857-2,1,18.509

But I feel a great desire now to see it in its very altered state from
what it was when I first left it, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.510

and I hope to see it during the next summer should my health permit.
OWEN-1857-2,1,18.511

After some time of this relaxation from business it was necessary for
me to seek for a new situation, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.512

and through Mr. McGuffog's recommendation I procured one with
Messrs Flint and Palmer, an old established house on old London Bridge,
Borough side, overlooking the Thames.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.513

It was a house established, and I believe the first, to sell at a small
profit for ready money only.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.514

The house was already wealthy, making all their purchases with money,
and continuing very successful.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.515

The house was originally established by Mr. Flint, who made what
was then deemed a large fortune for a retail trade, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.516

and he had an only daughter, who was married to Mr. Palmer, a
very respectable and gentlemanly person for his position, and an honest
and practical man of business.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.517

When Mr. Flint died, the establishment and the large capital were
left to the widow and the son-in-law and daughter.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.518

Mr. Palmer had two younger brothers now in the business, - the
youngest of them about my age.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.519

There were a considerable number of both sexes, and some of advanced age,
old assistants, at this time employed to attend to different departments
in the business.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.520

My previous habits prepared me to take an efficient part in the retail
division of the business of serving.  OWEN-1857-2,1,18.521

I was lodged and boarded in the house, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.522

and had a salary of twenty-five pounds a year, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.523

and I thought myself rich and independent, OWEN-1857-2,1,18.524

for I had more than sufficient to supply all my <P_1,19> personal wants.
OWEN-1857-2,1,19.525

Soon, however, as the spring advanced, I found this was a different
situation to the one I had enjoyed at Stamford.  OWEN-1857-2,1,19.526

The customers were of an inferior class, OWEN-1857-2,1,19.527

- they were treated differently.  OWEN-1857-2,1,19.528

Not much time was allowed for bargaining, a price being fixed for
everything, and, compared with other houses, cheap.  OWEN-1857-2,1,19.529

If any demur was made, or much hesitation, the article asked for was
withdrawn, OWEN-1857-2,1,19.530

and, as the shop was generally full from morning till late in the evening,
another customer was attended to.  OWEN-1857-2,1,19.531
