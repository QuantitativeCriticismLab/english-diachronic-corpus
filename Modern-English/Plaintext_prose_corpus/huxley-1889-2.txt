I AUTOBIOGRAPHY HUXLEY-1889-2,25.3

<$$heading>

The"many things"to which the Duchess's correspondent here refers
are the repairs and improvements of the episcopal seat at Auckland.
HUXLEY-1889-2,25.5

I doubt if the great apologist, greater in nothing than in the simple
dignity of his character, would have considered the writing an account
of himself as a thing which could be put upon him to do whatever
circumstances might be taken in.  HUXLEY-1889-2,25.6

But the good bishop lived in an age when a man might write books
and yet be permitted to keep his private existence to himself; in the
pre-Boswellian epoch, when the germ of the photographer lay in the womb
of the distant future, and the interviewer who pervades our <P_26> age
was an unforeseen, indeed unimaginable, birth of time.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.7

At present, the most convinced believer in the aphorism"Bene qui latuit ,
bene vixit,"is not always able to act up to it.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.8

An importunate person informs him that his portrait is about to be
published and will be accompanied by a biography which the importunate
person proposes to write.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.9

The sufferer knows what that means; HUXLEY-1889-2,26.10

either he undertakes to revise the"biography"HUXLEY-1889-2,26.11

or he does not.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.12

In the former case, he makes himself responsible; HUXLEY-1889-2,26.13

in the latter, he allows the publication of a mass of more or less
fulsome inaccuracies for which he will be held responsible by those
who are familiar with the prevalent art of self-advertisement.
HUXLEY-1889-2,26.14

On the whole, it may be better to get over the"burlesque of being employed
in this manner"and do the thing himself.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.15

It was by reflections of this kind that, some years ago, I was
led to write and permit the publication of the subjoined sketch.
HUXLEY-1889-2,26.16

I was born about eight o'clock in the morning on the 4th of May, 1825,
at Ealing, which was, at that time, as quiet a little country village
as could be found within $half $a $dozen {TEXT:half-a-dozen} miles of
Hyde Park Corner.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.17

Now it is a suburb of London with, I believe, 30,000 inhabitants.
HUXLEY-1889-2,26.18

My father was one of the masters in a large semi-public school which at
one time had a high reputation.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.19

I am not aware that any portents preceded my arrival in this world,
HUXLEY-1889-2,26.20

but, in my childhood, I remember hearing a traditional account of the
manner in which I lost the chance of an endowment of great practical
value.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.21

The windows of my mother's room were open, in consequence of the unusual
warmth of the weather.  HUXLEY-1889-2,26.22

For the same reason, <P_27> probably, a neighboring beehive had swarmed
, HUXLEY-1889-2,27.23

and the new colony, pitching on the window-sill, was making its way into
the room when the horrified nurse shut down the sash.  HUXLEY-1889-2,27.24

If that well-meaning woman had only abstained from her ill-timed
interference, the swarm might have settled on my lips, HUXLEY-1889-2,27.25

and I should have been endowed with that mellifluous eloquence which,
in this country, leads far more surely than worth, capacity, or honest
work, to the highest places in Church and State.  HUXLEY-1889-2,27.26

But the opportunity was lost, HUXLEY-1889-2,27.27

and I have been obliged to content myself through life with saying
what I mean in the plainest of plain language, than which, I suppose,
there is no habit more ruinous to a man's prospects of advancement.
HUXLEY-1889-2,27.28

Why I was christened Thomas Henry I do not know; HUXLEY-1889-2,27.29

but it is a curious chance that my parents should have fixed for my
usual denomination upon the name of that particular Apostle with whom
I have always felt most sympathy.  HUXLEY-1889-2,27.30

Physically and mentally I am the son of my mother so completely - even
down to peculiar movements of the hands, which made their appearance in
me as I reached the age she had when I noticed them - that I can hardly
find any trace of my father in myself, except an inborn faculty for
drawing, which unfortunately, in my case, has never been cultivated,
a hot temper, and that amount of tenacity of purpose which unfriendly
observers sometimes call obstinacy.  HUXLEY-1889-2,27.31

My mother was a slender brunette, of an emotional and energetic
temperament, and possessed of the most piercing black eyes I ever saw
in a woman's head.  HUXLEY-1889-2,27.32

With no more education than other women of the middle classes in her day,
she had an excellent mental capacity.  HUXLEY-1889-2,27.33

Her <P_28> most distinguishing characteristic, however, was rapidity
of thought.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.34

If one ventured to suggest she had not taken much time to arrive at
any conclusion, she would say,"I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help it,
HUXLEY-1889-2,28.35

things flash across me. "HUXLEY-1889-2,28.36

That peculiarity has been passed on to me in full strength;
HUXLEY-1889-2,28.37

it has often stood me in good stead; HUXLEY-1889-2,28.38

it has sometimes played me sad tricks, HUXLEY-1889-2,28.39

and it has always been a danger.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.40

But, after all, if my time were to come over again, there is nothing
I would less willingly part with than my inheritance of mother wit.
HUXLEY-1889-2,28.41

I have next to nothing to say about my childhood.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.42

In later years my mother, looking at me almost reproachfully, would
sometimes say,"Ah!  you were such a pretty boy! "whence I had no
difficulty in concluding that I had not fulfilled my early promise in
the matter of looks.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.43

In fact, I have a distinct recollection of certain curls of which I
was vain, and of a conviction that I closely resembled that handsome,
courtly gentleman, Sir Herbert Oakley, who was vicar of our parish,
and who was as a god to us country folk, because he was occasionally
visited by the then Prince George of Cambridge.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.44

I remember turning my pinafore wrong side forwards in order to represent
a surplice, and preaching to my mother's maids in the kitchen as nearly
as possible in Sir Herbert's manner one Sunday morning when the rest of
the family were at church.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.45

That is the earliest indication I can call to mind of the strong clerical
affinities which my friend Mr. Herbert Spencer has always ascribed
to me, though I fancy they have for the most part remained in a latent
state.  HUXLEY-1889-2,28.46

My regular school training was of the briefest, perhaps <P_29>
fortunately, HUXLEY-1889-2,29.47

for though my way of life has made me acquainted with all sorts and
conditions of men, from the highest to the lowest, I deliberately affirm
that the society I fell into at school was the worst I have ever known.
HUXLEY-1889-2,29.48

We boys were average lads, with much the same inherent capacity for good
and evil as any others; HUXLEY-1889-2,29.49

but the people who were set over us cared about as much for our
intellectual and moral welfare as if they were baby-farmers.
HUXLEY-1889-2,29.50

We were left to the operation of the struggle for existence among
ourselves, HUXLEY-1889-2,29.51

and bullying was the least of the ill practices current among us.
HUXLEY-1889-2,29.52

Almost the only cheerful reminiscence in connection with the place which
arises in my mind is that of a battle I had with one of my classmates,
who had bullied me until I could stand it no longer.  HUXLEY-1889-2,29.53

I was a very slight lad, HUXLEY-1889-2,29.54

but there was a wild-cat element in me which, when roused, made up for
lack of weight, HUXLEY-1889-2,29.55

and I licked my adversary effectually.  HUXLEY-1889-2,29.56

However, one of my first experiences of the extremely rough-and-ready
nature of justice, as exhibited by the course of things in general,
arose out of the fact that I - the victor - had a black eye, while he -
the vanquished - had none, so that I got into disgrace and he did not.
HUXLEY-1889-2,29.57

We made it up, HUXLEY-1889-2,29.58

and thereafter I was unmolested.  HUXLEY-1889-2,29.59

One of the greatest shocks I ever received in my life was to be
told a dozen years afterwards by the groom who brought me my horse
in a stable-yard in Sydney that he was my quondam antagonist.
HUXLEY-1889-2,29.60

He had a long story of family misfortune to account for his position,
HUXLEY-1889-2,29.61

but at that time it was necessary to deal very cautiously with mysterious
strangers in New South Wales, HUXLEY-1889-2,29.62

and on inquiry I found that the unfortunate <P_30> young man had not
only been"sent out,"but had undergone more than one colonial conviction.
HUXLEY-1889-2,30.63

As I grew older, my great desire was to be a mechanical engineer,
HUXLEY-1889-2,30.64

but the fates were against this HUXLEY-1889-2,30.65

and, while very young, I commenced the study of medicine under a medical
brother-in-law.  HUXLEY-1889-2,30.66

But, though the Institute of Mechanical Engineers would certainly not
own me, I am not sure that I have not all along been a sort of mechanical
engineer <font> in partibus infidelium.  <$$font> HUXLEY-1889-2,30.67

I am now occasionally horrified to think how very little I ever knew or
cared about medicine as the art of healing.  HUXLEY-1889-2,30.68

The only part of my professional course which really and deeply interested
me was physiology, which is the mechanical engineering of living machines
; HUXLEY-1889-2,30.69

and, notwithstanding that natural science has been my proper business
, I am afraid there is very little of the genuine naturalist in me.
HUXLEY-1889-2,30.70

I never collected anything, HUXLEY-1889-2,30.71

and species work was always a burden to me; HUXLEY-1889-2,30.72

what I cared for was the architectural and engineering part of the
business, the working out the wonderful unity of plan in the thousands
and thousands of diverse living constructions, and the modifications of
similar apparatuses to serve diverse ends.  HUXLEY-1889-2,30.73

The extraordinary attraction I felt towards the study of the
intricacies of living structure nearly proved fatal to me at the outset.
HUXLEY-1889-2,30.74

I was a mere boy - I think between thirteen and fourteen years of age -
when I was taken by some older student friends of mine to the first <font>
post-mortem <$$font> examination I ever attended.  HUXLEY-1889-2,30.75

All my life I have been most unfortunately sensitive to the disagreeables
which attend anatomical pursuits, HUXLEY-1889-2,30.76

but on this occasion my curiosity overpowered all other feelings,
HUXLEY-1889-2,30.77

and I spent two <P_31> or three hours in gratifying it.
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.78

I did not cut myself, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.79

and none of the ordinary symptoms of dissection-poison supervened,
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.80

but poisoned I was somehow, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.81

and I remember sinking into a strange state of apathy.
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.82

By way of a last chance, I was sent to the care of some good, kind
people, friends of my father's, who lived in a farmhouse in the heart
of Warwickshire.  HUXLEY-1889-2,31.83

I remember staggering from my bed to the window on the bright
spring morning after my arrival, and throwing open the casement.
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.84

Life seemed to come back on the wings of the breeze, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.85

and to this day the faint odor, of wood-smoke, like that which floated
across the farm-yard in the early morning, is as good to me as the"
sweet south upon a bed of violets. "HUXLEY-1889-2,31.86

I soon recovered, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.87

but for years I suffered from occasional paroxysms of internal pain,
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.88

and from that time my constant friend, hypochondriacal dyspepsia,
commenced his half century of cotenancy of my fleshly tabernacle.
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.89

Looking back on my"Lehrjahre,"I am sorry to say that I do not think
that any account of my doings as a student would tend to edification.
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.90

In fact, I should distinctly warn ingenuous youth to avoid imitating
my example.  HUXLEY-1889-2,31.91

I worked extremely hard when it pleased me, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.92

and when it did not - which was a very frequent case - I was extremely
idle <paren> unless making caricatures of one's pastors and masters is
to be called a branch of industry <$$paren>, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.93

or else wasted my energies in wrong directions.  HUXLEY-1889-2,31.94

I read everything I could lay hands upon, including novels,
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.95

and took up all sorts of pursuits to drop them again quite as speedily.
HUXLEY-1889-2,31.96

No doubt it was very largely my own fault, HUXLEY-1889-2,31.97

but the only instruction from which I ever obtained the proper effect
of education was that which I received from <P_32> Mr. Wharton
Jones, who was the lecturer on physiology at the Charing Cross School
of Medicine.  HUXLEY-1889-2,32.98

The extent and precision of his knowledge impressed me greatly,
HUXLEY-1889-2,32.99

and the severe exactness of his method of lecturing was quite to my taste.
HUXLEY-1889-2,32.100

I do not know that I have ever felt so much respect for anybody as a
teacher before or since.  HUXLEY-1889-2,32.101

I worked hard to obtain his approbation, HUXLEY-1889-2,32.102

and he was extremely kind and helpful to the youngster who, I
am afraid, took up more of his time than he had any right to do.
HUXLEY-1889-2,32.103

It was he who suggested the publication of my first scientific paper -
a very little one - in the <font> Medical Gazette <$$font> of 1845,
and most kindly corrected the literary faults which abounded in it,
short as it was; HUXLEY-1889-2,32.104

for at that time, and for many years afterwards, I detested the trouble
of writing, HUXLEY-1889-2,32.105

and would take no pains over it.  HUXLEY-1889-2,32.106

It was in the early spring of 1846, that, having finished my obligatory
medical studies and passed the first M. B. examination
at the London University - though I was still too young to qualify at
the College of Surgeons - I was talking to a fellow-student <paren> the
present eminent physician, Sir Joseph Fayrer <$$paren>, and wondering what
I should do to meet the imperative necessity for earning my own bread ,
when my friend suggested that I should write to Sir William Burnett ,
at that time Director-General for the Medical Service of the Navy,
for an appointment.  HUXLEY-1889-2,32.107

I thought this rather a strong thing to do, as Sir William was personally
unknown to me, HUXLEY-1889-2,32.108

but my cheery friend would not listen to my scruples, HUXLEY-1889-2,32.109

so I went to my lodgings HUXLEY-1889-2,32.110

and wrote the best letter I could devise.  HUXLEY-1889-2,32.111

A few days afterwards I received the usual official circular of
acknowledgment, HUXLEY-1889-2,32.112

but at the bottom there was <P_33> written an instruction to call at
Somerset House on such a day.  HUXLEY-1889-2,33.113

I thought that looked like business, HUXLEY-1889-2,33.114

so at the appointed time I called HUXLEY-1889-2,33.115

and sent in my card, while I waited in Sir William's ante-room.
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.116

He was a tall, shrewd-looking old gentleman, with a broad Scotch accent
- HUXLEY-1889-2,33.117

and I think I see him now as he entered with my card in his hand.
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.118

The first thing he did was to return it, with the frugal reminder
that I should probably find it useful on some other occasion.
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.119

The second was to ask whether I was an Irishman.  HUXLEY-1889-2,33.120

I suppose the air of modesty about my appeal must have struck him.
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.121

I satisfied the Director-General that I was English to the backbone,
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.122

and he made some inquiries as to my student career, finally desiring me
to hold myself ready for examination.  HUXLEY-1889-2,33.123

Having passed this, I was in Her Majesty's Service, and entered on the
books of Nelson's old ship, the <font> Victory, <$$font> for duty at
Haslar Hospital, about a couple of months after I made my application.
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.124

My official chief at Haslar was a very remarkable person, the late Sir
John Richardson, an excellent naturalist, and far-famed as an indomitable
Arctic traveler.  HUXLEY-1889-2,33.125

He was a silent, reserved man, outside the circle of his family and
intimates; HUXLEY-1889-2,33.126

and, having a full share of youthful vanity, I was extremely disgusted
to find that"Old John,"as we irreverent youngsters called him, took
not the slightest notice of my worshipful self either the first time
I attended him, as it was my duty to do, or for some weeks afterwards.
HUXLEY-1889-2,33.127

I am afraid to think of the lengths to which my tongue may have run on
the subject of the churlishness of the chief, who was, in truth, one of
the kindest-hearted and most considerate of men.  HUXLEY-1889-2,33.128

<P_34>

But one day, as I was crossing the hospital square, Sir John stopped me,
HUXLEY-1889-2,34.130

and heaped coals of fire on my head by telling me that he had tried
to get me one of the resident appointments, much coveted by the
assistant surgeons, but that the Admiralty had put in another man.
HUXLEY-1889-2,34.131

"However,"said he,"I mean to keep you here till I can get you something
you will like,"HUXLEY-1889-2,34.132

and turned upon his heel without waiting for the thanks I stammered out.
HUXLEY-1889-2,34.133

That explained how it was I had not been packed off to the West Coast
of Africa like some of my juniors, and why, eventually, I remained
altogether seven months at Haslar.  HUXLEY-1889-2,34.134

After a long interval, during which"Old John"ignored my existence almost
as completely as before, he stopped me again as we met in a casual way,
HUXLEY-1889-2,34.135

and describing the service on which the <font> Rattlesnake <$$font>
was likely to be employed, said that Captain Owen Stanley, who was to
command the ship, had asked him to recommend an assistant surgeon who
knew something of science; HUXLEY-1889-2,34.136

would I like that?  HUXLEY-1889-2,34.137

Of course I jumped at the offer.  HUXLEY-1889-2,34.138

"Very well, I give you leave; HUXLEY-1889-2,34.139

go to London at once HUXLEY-1889-2,34.140

and see Captain Stanley. "HUXLEY-1889-2,34.141

I went, HUXLEY-1889-2,34.142

saw my future commander, who was very civil to me, and promised to
ask that I should be appointed to his ship, as in due time I was.
HUXLEY-1889-2,34.143

It is a singular thing that, during the few months of my stay at Haslar
, I had among my messmates two future Directors-General of the Medical
Service of the Navy <paren> Sir Alexander Armstrong and Sir John Watt-Reid
<$$paren>, with the present President of the College of Physicians and
my kindest of doctors, Sir Andrew Clark.  HUXLEY-1889-2,34.144

Life on board Her Majesty's ships in those days was <P_35> a very
different affair from what it is now, HUXLEY-1889-2,35.145

and ours was exceptionally rough, as we were often many months without
receiving letters or seeing any civilized people but ourselves.
HUXLEY-1889-2,35.146

In exchange, we had the interest of being about the last voyagers,
I suppose, to whom it could be possible to meet with people who knew
nothing of firearms - as we did on the south Coast of New Guinea -
and of making acquaintance with a variety of interesting savage and
semi-civilized people.  HUXLEY-1889-2,35.147

But, apart from experience of this kind and the opportunities offered for
scientific work, to me, personally, the cruise was extremely valuable.
HUXLEY-1889-2,35.148

It was good for me to live under sharp discipline; to be down on the
realities of existence by living on bare necessaries; to find out how
extremely well worth living life seemed to be when one woke up from
a night's rest on a soft plank, with the sky for canopy and coco and
weevilly biscuit the sole prospect for breakfast; and, more especially,
to learn to work for the sake of what I got for myself out of it, even
if it all went to the bottom and I along with it.  HUXLEY-1889-2,35.149

My brother officers were as good fellows as sailors ought to be and
generally are, HUXLEY-1889-2,35.150

but, naturally, they neither knew nor cared anything about my pursuits ,
HUXLEY-1889-2,35.151

nor understood why I should be so zealous in pursuit of the objects
which my friends, the middies, christened"Buffons,"after the title
conspicuous on a volume of the"Suits a` Buffon,"which stood on my shelf
in the chart room.  HUXLEY-1889-2,35.152

During the four years of our absence, I sent home communication
after communication to the"Linnean Society,"with the same result
as that obtained by Noah when he sent the raven out of his ark.
HUXLEY-1889-2,35.153

Tired at last of hearing <P_36> nothing about them, I determined to do
or die, HUXLEY-1889-2,36.154

and in 1849 I drew up a more elaborate paper HUXLEY-1889-2,36.155

and forwarded it to the Royal Society.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.156

This was my dove, if I had only known it.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.157

But owing to the movements of the ship, I heard nothing of that either
until my return to England in the latter end of the year 1850, when
I found that it was printed and published, and that a huge packet of
separate copies awaited me.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.158

When I hear some of my young friends complain of want of sympathy and
encouragement, I am inclined to think that my naval life was not the
least valuable part of my education.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.159

Three years after my return were occupied by a battle between my
scientific friends on the one hand and the Admiralty on the other, as
to whether the latter ought, or ought not, to act up to the spirit of a
pledge they had given to encourage officers who had done scientific work
by contributing to the expense of publishing mine.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.160

At last the Admiralty, getting tired, I suppose, cut short the
discussion by ordering me to join a ship, which thing I declined to do ,
HUXLEY-1889-2,36.161

and as Rastignac, in the Pe`re Goriot, says to Paris, I said to London
<font>"a` nous deux. "<$$font> HUXLEY-1889-2,36.162

I desired to obtain a Professorship of either Physiology or Comparative
Anatomy, HUXLEY-1889-2,36.163

and as vacancies occurred I applied, but in vain.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.164

My friend, Professor Tyndall, and I were candidates at the same time ,
he for the Chair of Physics and I for that of Natural History in the
University of Toronto, which, fortunately, as it turned out, would not
look at either of us.  HUXLEY-1889-2,36.165

I say fortunately, not from any lack of respect for Toronto, but
because I soon made up my mind that London was the place for me,
HUXLEY-1889-2,36.166

and hence I have steadily declined the inducements to leave it, which
have at <P_37> various times been offered.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.167

At last, in 1854, on the translation of my warm friend Edward Forbes , to
Edinburgh, Sir Henry de la Beche, the Director-General of the Geological
Survey, offered me the post Forbes vacated of Paleontologist and Lecturer
on Natural History.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.168

I refused the former point blank, HUXLEY-1889-2,37.169

and accepted the latter only provisionally, telling Sir Henry that I did
not care for fossils, and that I should give up Natural History as soon
as I could get a physiological post.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.170

But I held the office for thirty-one years, HUXLEY-1889-2,37.171

and a large part of my work has been paleontological.
HUXLEY-1889-2,37.172

At that time I disliked public speaking, HUXLEY-1889-2,37.173

and had a firm conviction that I should break down every time I opened
my mouth.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.174

I believe I had every fault a speaker could have <paren> except talking
at random or indulging in rhetoric <$$paren>, when I spoke to the first
important audience I ever addressed, on a Friday evening at the Royal
Institution, in 1852.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.175

Yet, I must confess to having been guilty, <font> malgre` moi, <$$font> of
as much public speaking as most of my contemporaries, HUXLEY-1889-2,37.176

and for the last ten years it ceased to be so much of a bugbear to me.
HUXLEY-1889-2,37.177

I used to pity myself for having to go through this training,
HUXLEY-1889-2,37.178

but I am now more disposed to compassionate the unfortunate audiences,
especially my ever-friendly hearers at the Royal Institution, who were
the subjects of my oratorical experiments.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.179

The last thing that it would be proper for me to do would be to speak
of the work of my life, or to say at the end of the day whether I think
I have earned my wages or not.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.180

Men are said to be partial judges of themselves.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.181

Young men may be, HUXLEY-1889-2,37.182

I doubt if old men are.  HUXLEY-1889-2,37.183

Life seems terribly foreshortened as they look back, and <P_38> the
mountain they set themselves to climb in youth turns out to be a mere
spur of immeasurably higher ranges when, with failing breath, they reach
the top.  HUXLEY-1889-2,38.184

But if I may speak of the objects I have had more or less definitely in
view since I began the ascent of my hillock, they are briefly these: To
promote the increase of natural knowledge and to forward the application
of scientific methods of investigation to all the problems of life to
the best of my ability, in the conviction which has grown with my growth
and stengthened with my strength, that there is no alleviation for the
sufferings of mankind except veracity of thought and of action, and the
resolute facing of the world as it is when the garment of make-believe
by which pious hands have hidden its uglier features is stripped off.
HUXLEY-1889-2,38.185

It is with this intent that I have subordinated any reasonable, or
unreasonable, ambition for scientific fame which I may have permitted
myself to entertain to other ends; to the popularization of science ;
to the development and organization of scientific education; to the
endless series of battles and skirmishes over evolution; and to untiring
opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit, that clericalism, which in
England, as everywhere else, and to whatever denomination it may belong,
is the deadly enemy of science.  HUXLEY-1889-2,38.186

In striving for the attainment of these objects, I have been but one
among many, HUXLEY-1889-2,38.187

and I shall be well content to be remembered, or even not remembered,
as such.  HUXLEY-1889-2,38.188

Circumstances, among which I am proud to reckon the devoted kindness of
many friends, have led to my occupation of various prominent positions,
among which the <P_39> Presidency of the Royal Society is the highest.
HUXLEY-1889-2,39.189

It would be mock modesty on my part, with these and other scientific
honors which have been bestowed upon me, to pretend that I have not
succeeded in the career which I have followed, rather because I was
driven into it than of my own free will; HUXLEY-1889-2,39.190

but I am afraid I should not count even these things as marks of success
if I could not hope that I had somewhat helped that movement of opinion
which has been called the New Reformation.  HUXLEY-1889-2,39.191
