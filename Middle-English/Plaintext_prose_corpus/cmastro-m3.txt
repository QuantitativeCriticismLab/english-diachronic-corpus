A TREATISE ON THE ASTROLABE CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.3

<$$heading>

Lyte Lowys my sone, I aperceyve wel by certeyne evydences thyn abilite
to lerne sciences touching nombres and proporciouns; CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.5

and as wel considre I thy besy praier in special to lerne the tretys of
the Astrelabie.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.6

Than for as mochel as a philosofre saith,"he wrappith him in his frend,
that condescendith to the rightfulle praiers of his frend," therfore have
I yeven the a suffisant Astrolabie as for oure orizonte, compowned after
the latitude of Oxenforde; upon which, by mediacioun of this litel tretys,
I purpose to teche the a certein nombre of conclusions aperteynyng to
the same instrument.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.7

I seie a certein of conclusions, for thre causes.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.8

The first cause is this: truste wel that alle the conclusions that han
be founde, or ellys possibly might be founde in so noble an instrument as
is an Astrelabie ben unknowe parfitly to eny mortal man in this regioun,
as I suppose.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.9

Another cause is this, that sothly in any tretis of the Astrelabie that
I have seyn, there be somme conclusions that wol not in alle thinges
parformen her bihestes; CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.10

and somme of hem ben to harde to thy tendir age of ten yeer to conceyve.
CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.11

This tretis, divided in 5 parties, wol I shewe the under full light
reules and naked wordes in Englissh, CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.12

for Latyn ne canst thou yit but small, my litel sone.
CMASTRO-M3,662.C1.13

But natheles suffise to the these trewe conclusions in Englissh as wel as
sufficith to these noble clerkes Grekes these same conclusions in Grek;
and to Arabiens in Arabik, and to Jewes in Ebrew, and to Latyn folk in
Latyn; whiche Latyn folk had hem first out of othere dyverse langages,
and <P_662.C2> writen hem in her owne tunge, that is to seyn, in Latyn.
CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.14

And God woot that in alle these langages and in many moo han these
conclusions ben suffisantly lerned and taught, and yit be diverse reules
; right as diverse pathes leden diverse folk the righte way to Rome.
CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.15

Now wol I preie mekely every discret persone that redith or herith this
litel tretys to have my rude endityng for excusid, and my superfluite
of wordes, for two causes.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.16

The first cause is for that curious endityng and hard sentence is ful
hevy at onys for such a child to lerne.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.17

And the secunde cause is this, that sothly me semith better to writen
unto a child twyes a god sentence, than {it_seems} he forgete it onys.
CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.18

And Lowys, yf so be that I shewe the in my lighte Englissh as trewe
conclusions touching this mater, and not oonly as trewe but as many and
as subtile conclusiouns, as ben shewid in Latyn in eny commune tretys
of the Astrelabie, konne me the more thank.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.19

And preie God save the king, that is lord of this langage, and alle
that him feith berith and obeieth, everich in his degre, the more and
the lasse.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.20

But considre wel that I ne usurpe not to have founden this werk of my
labour or of myn engyn.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.21

I n'am but a lewd compilator of the labour of olde astrologiens,
CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.22

and have it translatid in myn Englissh oonly for thy doctrine.
CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.23

And with this swerd shal I sleen envie.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.24

Prima pars.- CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.25

The firste partie of this tretys shal reherse the figures and the membres
of thyn Astrelabie by cause that thou shalt have the gretter knowing of
thyn oune instrument.  CMASTRO-M3,662.C2.26

<P_663.C1>

Secunda pars.- CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.28

The secunde partie shal techen the worken the verrey practik of the
forseide conclusiouns, as ferforth and as narwe as may be shewed in so
small an instrument portatif aboute.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.29

For wel woot every astrologien that smallist fraccions ne wol not be
shewid in so small an instrument as in subtile tables calculed for
a cause.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.30

Tertia pars.- CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.31

The thirde partie shal contene diverse tables of longitudes and latitudes
of sterres fixe for the Astrelabie, and tables of the declinacions of
the sonne, and tables of longitudes of citees and townes; and tables
as well for the governaunce of a clokke, as for to fynde the altitude
meridian; and many anothir notable conclusioun after the kalenders of
the reverent clerkes, Frere J. Somer and Frere N. Lenne.
CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.32

Quarta pars.- CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.33

The fourthe partie shal ben a theorike to declare the moevyng of
the celestiall <P_663.C2> bodies with the causes.  The whiche fourthe
partie in speciall shal shewen a table of the verrey moeving of the mone
from houre to houre every day and in every signe after thyn almenak.
Upon which table there folewith a canoun suffisant to teche as wel the
manere of the worchynge of the same conclusioun as to knowe in oure
orizonte with which degre of the zodiak that the mone arisith in any
latitude, and the arisyng of any planete after his latitude fro the
ecliptik lyne.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C2.34

Quinta pars.- CMASTRO-M3,663.C2.35

The fifthe partie shal be an introductorie, after the statutes of oure
doctours, in which thou maist lerne a gret part of the generall rewles of
theorik in astrologie.  In which fifthe partie shalt thou fynden tables
of equaciouns of houses after the latitude of Oxenforde; and tables of
dignitees of planetes, and othere notefull thinges, yf God wol vouche
saaf and his Moder the Maide, moo than I behete.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C2.36

HERE BEGYNNETH THE DESCRIPCIOUN OF THIN ASTRALABIE.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.39

<$$heading>

1.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.41

Thyn Astralabie hath a ring to putten on the thombe of thi right hond
in taking the height of thinges.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.42

And tak kep, CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.43

for from henes forthward I wol clepen the heighte of any thing
that is taken by the rewle"the altitude,"withoute moo wordes.
CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.44

2.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.45

This ryng renneth in a maner toret fast to the moder of thyn Astrelabie
in so rowme a space that it distourbith not the instrument to hangen
after his right centre.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.46

3.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C1.47

The moder of thin Astrelabye is thikkest plate, perced with a large hool ,
that resceiveth <P_663.C2> in hir wombe the thynne plates compowned for
diverse clymates, and thy reet shapen in manere of a nett or of a web
of a loppe.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C2.48

4.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C2.49

This moder is dividid on the bakhalf with a lyne that cometh descending
fro the ring doun to the netherist bordure.  The whiche lyne, fro the
forseide ring unto the centre of the large hool amidde, is clepid the
south lyne, or ellis the lyne meridional.  CMASTRO-M3,663.C2.50

And the remenaunt of this lyne doun to the bordure is <P_664.C1> clepid
the north lyne, or ellis the lyne of midnyght.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C1.51

5.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C1.52

Overthwart this forseide longe lyne ther crossith him another lyne of the
same lengthe from eest to west.  Of the whiche lyne, from a litel cros
{COM:figure_omitted} in the bordure unto the centre of the large hool,
is clepid the est lyne, or ellis the lyne orientale.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C1.53

And the remenaunt of this lyne, fro the forseide centre unto the
bordure, is clepid the west lyne, or ellis the lyne occidentale.
CMASTRO-M3,664.C1.54

Now hast thou here the foure quarters of thin Astrolabie divided after
the <P_664.C2> foure principales plages or quarters of the firmament.
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.55

6.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.56

The est syde of thyn Astrolabie is clepid the right syde,
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.57

and the west syde is clepid the left syde.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.58

Forget not thys, litel Lowys.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.59

Put the ryng of thyn Astrolabie upon the thombe of thi right hond,
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.60

and than wol his right side be toward thi lift side, CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.61

and his left side wol be toward thy right side.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.62

Tak this rewle generall, as wel on the bak as on the wombe syde.
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.63

Upon the ende of this est lyne, as I first seide, is marked a
litel cros {COM:figure_omitted}, where as evere moo generaly is
considerid the entring of the first degre in which the sonne arisith.
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.64

7.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.65

Fro this litel cros {COM:figure_omitted} up to the ende of the lyne
meridionall, under the ryng, shalt thou fynden the bordure divided with
90 degrees; CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.66

and by that same proporcioun is every quarter of thin Astrolabie divided.
Over the whiche degrees ther ben noumbres of augrym that dividen thilke
same degres fro 5 to 5, as shewith by longe strikes bitwene.  Of whiche
longe strikes the space bitwene contenith a myle wey, and every degre of
the bordure conteneth 4 minutes; this is to seien, mynutes of an houre.
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.67

8.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.68

Under the compas of thilke degrees ben writen the names of the 12 Signes :
as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,
Capricornus, Aquarius, Piscis.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.69

And the nombres of the degrees of thoo signes be writen in augrym above
, and with longe divisiouns fro 5 to 5, dyvidid fro the tyme that the
signe entrith unto the last ende.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.70

But understond wel that these degres of signes ben everich of hem
considred of 60 mynutes, and every mynute of 60 secundes, and so furth
into smale fraccions infinite, as saith Alkabucius.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.71

And therfore knowe wel that a degre of the bordure contenith 4 minutes,
and a degre of a signe conteneth 60 minutes, CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.72

and have this in mynde.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.73

9.  CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.74

Next this folewith the cercle of the daies, that ben figured in
manere of degres, that contenen in nombre 365, dividid also with longe
strikes fro 5 to 5, and the nombre in augrym writen under that cercle.
CMASTRO-M3,664.C2.75

<P_665.C1>

10.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.77

Next the cercle of the daies folewith the cercle of the names of
the monthes, that is to say, Januarius, Februarius, Marcius, Aprilis,
Maius, Junius, Julius, Augustus, September, October, November, December.
CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.78

The names of these monthes were clepid somme for her propirtees and
somme by statutes of lordes Arabiens, somme by othre lordes of Rome.
CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.79

Eke of these monthes, as liked to Julius Cesar and to Cesar Augustus,
somme were compouned of diverse nombres of daies, as Julie and August.
CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.80

Than hath Januarie 31 daies, Februarie 28, March 31, Aprill 30, May 31,
Junius 30, Julius 31, Augustus 31, Septembre 30, Octobre 31, Novembre 30,
Decembre 31.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.81

Natheles, all though that Julius Cesar toke 2 daies out of Feverer and
putte hem in his month of Juyll, and Augustus Cesar clepid the month of
August after his name and ordeined it of 31 daies, yit truste wel that
the sonne dwellith therfore nevere the more ne lasse in oon signe than
in another.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.82

11.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.83

Than folewen the names of the holy daies in the Kalender, and next hem
the lettres of the A B C on whiche thei fallen.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.84

12.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.85

Next the forseide cercle of the A B C, under the cross lyne, is marked the
skale in manere of 2 squyres, or ellis in manere of laddres, that serveth
by his 12 pointes and his dyvisiouns of ful many a subtil conclusioun.
CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.86

Of this forseide skale fro the cross lyne unto the verrey angle is clepid
Umbra Versa, CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.87

and the nethir partie is clepid Umbra Recta, or ellis Umbra Extensa.
CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.88

13.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.89

Than hast thou a brod reule, that hath on either ende a square plate
perced with certein holes, somme more and somme lasse, to resceyve the
stremes of the sonne by day, and eke by mediacioun of thin eye to knowe
the altitude of sterres by night.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.90

14.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.91

Than is there a large pyn in manere of an extre, that goth thorugh the
hole that halt the tables of the clymates and the riet in the wombe of
the moder; thorugh which pyn ther goth a litel wegge, which that is clepid
the hors, that streynith all these parties to-hepe.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C1.92

Thys forseide grete pyn in manere of an extre <P_665.C2> is ymagyned to
be the Pool Artik in thyn Astralabie.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C2.93

15.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C2.94

The wombe syde of thyn Astrelabie is also divided with a longe cros in
4 quarters from est to west, fro southe to northe, fro right syde to
left side, as is the bakside.  16.  The bordure of which wombe side is
divided fro the point of the est lyne unto the point of the south lyne
under the ring, in 90 degrees; CMASTRO-M3,665.C2.95

and by that same proporcioun is every quarter divided, as is the bakside.
CMASTRO-M3,665.C2.96

That amountith 360 degrees.  CMASTRO-M3,665.C2.97

And understond wel that degres of this bordure ben aunswering and
consentrike to the degrees of the equinoxiall, that is dividid in the
same nombre as {in} every <P_666.C1> othir cercle is in the highe hevene.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.98

This same bordure is divided also with 23 lettres capitals and a small
cross {COM:figure_omitted} above the south lyne, that shewith the 24
houres equals of the clokke.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.99

And, as I have seid, 5 of these degres maken a myle wey,
CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.100

and 3 milewei maken an houre.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.101

And every degre of thys bordure contenith 4 minutes, and every minute
60 secundes.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.102

Now have I told the twyes.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.103

17.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C1.104

The plate under the riet is discrived with 3 cercles, of whiche the leest
is clepid the cercle of Cancre by cause that the heved of Cancre turnith
evermo consentrik <P_666.C2> upon the same cercle.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.105

In this heved of Cancer is the grettist declinacioun northward of the
sonne, CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.106

and therfore is he clepid solsticium of somer; which declinacioun, after
Ptholome, is 23 degrees and 50 minutes as wel in Cancer as in Capricorn.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.107

This signe of Cancer is clepid the tropik of somer, of tropos, that is
to seien"ageynward. "CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.108

For than beginneth the sonne to passen from us-ward.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.109

The myddel cercle in wydnesse, of these 3, is clepid the cercle
equinoxiall, upon which turnith evermo the hevedes of Aries and Libra.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.110

And understond wel that evermo thys cercle equinoxiall turnith justly
from verrey est to verrey west as I have shewed the in the speer solide.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.111

This same cercle is clepid also Equator, that is the weyer of the day;
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.112

for whan the sonne is in the hevedes of Aries and Libra, than
ben the dayes and the nightes ylike of lengthe in all the world.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.113

And therfore ben these 2 signes called the equinoxiis.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.114

And all that moeveth withinne the hevedes of these Aries and Libra,
his moevyng is clepid northward; CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.115

and all that moevith withoute these hevedes, his moevyng is clepid
southward, as fro the equinoxiall.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.116

Tak kep of these latitudes north and south, CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.117

and forget it nat.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.118

By this cercle equinoxiall ben considred the 24 houres of the clokke;
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.119

for evermo the arisyng of 15 degrees of the equinoxiall makith an houre
equal of the clokke.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.120

This equinoxiall is clepid the gurdel of the first moeving, or ellis of
the first moevable.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.121

And note that the firste moevyng is clepid moevyng of the firste moevable
of the 8 speer, which moeving is from est to west, and eft ageyn into est.
CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.122

Also it is clepid girdel of the firste moeving for it departith the
firste moevable, that is to seyn the spere, in two like partyes evene
distantz fro the poles of this world.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.123

The widest of these 3 principale cercles is clepid the cercle of
Capricorne, by cause that the heved of Capricorne turneth evermo
consentrik upon the same cercle.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.124

In the heved of this forseide Capricorne is the grettist declinacioun
southward of the sonne, CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.125

and therfore it is clepid the solsticium of wynter.  CMASTRO-M3,666.C2.126

This signe of Capricorne is also clepid the <P_667.C1> tropic of wynter
, CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.127

for than begynneth the sonne to come ageyn to us-ward.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.128

18.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.129

Upon this forseide plate ben compassed certeyn cercles that highten
almycanteras, of whiche somme of hem semen parfit cercles and somme
semen inparfit.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.130

The centre that stondith amyddes the narwest cercle is clepid the cenyth.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.131

And the netherist cercle, or the firste cercle, is clepid the orizonte
, that is to seyn, the cercle that divideth the two emysperies, that
is, the partie of the hevene above the erthe and the partie bynethe.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.132

These almykanteras ben compowned by 2 and 2, all be it so that on
diverse Astrelabies somme almykanteras ben divided by oon, and somme
by two, and somme by thre, after the quantite of the Astrelabie.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.133

This forseide cenyth is ymagined to ben the verrey point over the crowne
of thin heved.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.134

And also this cenyth is the verray pool of the orizonte in every regioun.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.135

19.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.136

From this cenyth, as it semeth, there comen a maner croked strikes like
to the clawes of a loppe, or elles like the werk of a wommans calle,
in kervyng overthwart the almykanteras.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.137

And these same strikes or divisiouns ben clepid azimutz,
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.138

and thei dividen the orisounte of thin Astrelabie in 24 divisiouns.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.139

And these azymutz serven to knowe the costes of the firmament, and
to othre conclusions, as for to knowe the cenyth of the sonne and of
every sterre.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.140

20.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.141

Next these azymutz, under the cercle of Cancer, ben there 12 divisiouns
embelif, muche like to the shap of the azemutz, that shewen the spaces
of the houres of planetes.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.142

21.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C1.143

The riet of thin Astrelabie with thy zodiak, shapen in manere of a net
or of a lopweb after the olde descripcioun, which thou maist turnen up
and doun as thiself liketh, contenith certein nombre of sterres fixes,
with her longitudes and latitudes determinat, yf so be that the <P_667.C2>
maker have not errid.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C2.144

The names of the sterres ben writen in the margyn of the riet there
as thei sitte, of whiche sterres the smale point is clepid the centre.
CMASTRO-M3,667.C2.145

And understond also that alle the sterres sitting within the zodiak
of thin Astrelabie ben clepid sterres of the north, for thei arise by
northe the est lyne.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C2.146

And all the remenaunt fixed oute of the zodiak ben clepid sterres of
the south.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C2.147

But I seie not that thei arisen alle by southe the est lyne;
CMASTRO-M3,667.C2.148

witnesse on Aldeberan and Algomeysa.  CMASTRO-M3,667.C2.149

Generaly understond this <P_668.C1> rewle, that thilke sterres that
ben clepid sterres of the north arisen rather than the degre of her
longitude, and alle the sterres of the south arisen after the degre
of her longitude - this is to seyn, sterres fixed in thyn Astrelabie.
CMASTRO-M3,668.C1.150

The mesure of this longitude of sterres is taken in the lyne ecliptik of
hevene, <P_668.C2> under which lyne, whan that the sonne and the mone be
lyne-right, or ellis in the superficie of this lyne, than is the eclipse
of the sonne or of the mone, as I shal declare, and eke the cause why.
CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.151

But sothly the ecliptik lyne of thy zodiak is the utterist bordure of
thy zodiak there the degrees be marked.  CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.152

Thy zodiak of thin Astrelabie is shapen as a compas which that contenith
a large brede as after the quantite of thyn Astrelabie, in ensample that
the zodiak in hevene is ymagyned to ben a superfice contenyng a latitude
of 12 degrees, whereas alle the remenaunt of cercles in the hevene ben
ymagyned verrey lynes withoute eny latitude.  CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.153

Amiddes this celestial zodiak is ymagined a lyne which that is clepid
the ecliptik lyne, under which lyne is evermo the wey of the sonne.
CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.154

Thus ben there 6 degres of the zodiak on that oo syde of the lyne and
6 degrees on that othir.  CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.155

This zodiak is dividid in 12 principale divisiouns that departen the 12
signes, CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.156

and, for the streitnesse of thin Astrolabie, than is every smal divisioun
in a signe departed by two degrees and two, CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.157

I mene degrees contenyng 60 mynutes.  CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.158

for"zodia"in langage of Grek sowneth"bestes"in Latyn tunge.
CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.160

And in the zodiak ben the 12 signes that han names of bestes, or
ellis for whan the sonne entrith into eny of tho signes he takith
the propirte of suche bestes, or ellis for that the sterres that ben
ther fixed ben disposid in signes of bestes or shape like bestes, or

CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.161

And understond also that whan an hot planete cometh into an hot signe,

and yf a planete be cold, than amenusith his coldnesse by cause of the
hoote sygne.  CMASTRO-M3,668.C2.163

And by thys conclusioun maist thou take ensample in alle the signes,
be thei moist or drie, or moeble or fixe, reknyng the qualite of the

And everich of these 12 signes hath respect to a certeyn <P_669.C1>

and hath it in governaunce; as Aries hath thin heved, and Taurus thy

And in this wise had I the experience for evermo in which manere I shulde

Among an heep of sterres fixe it liked me for to take the altitude of

Tho sette I the centre of this Alhabor upon 12 degrees among myn
almykanteras upon the west side, by cause that she was founde on the
west side.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.242

Tho leyde I my label over the degre of the sonne, that was discendid
under the west orisounte, CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.243

and rekned all the lettres capitals fro the lyne of midday unto the
point of my label in the bordure, CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.244

And thus lerned I to knowe onys for ever in which manere I shuld come
to the houre of the nyght, and to myn ascendent, as verrely as may be
taken by so smal an instrument.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.248

But natheles this rule in generall wol I warne the for evere:
CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.249

Ne make the nevere bold to have take a just ascendent by thin Astrelabie
, or elles to have set justly a clokke, whan eny celestial body by
which that thou wenyst governe thilke thinges be nigh the south lyne.
CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.250

For trust wel, whan the sonne is nygh the meridional lyne, the degre of
the sonne renneth so longe consentrik upon the almykanteras that sothly
thou shalt erre fro the just ascendent.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.251

The same conclusion sey I by the centre of eny sterre fix by nyght.
CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.252

And more over, by experience I wot wel that in our orisounte, from xi
of the clokke unto oon of the clokke, in taking of a just ascendent in
a portatif Astrelabie it is to hard to knowe - I mene from xi of the
clokke before the houre of noon til oon of the clokke next folewyng.

A SPECIAL DECLARACIOUN OF THE ASCENDENT.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.256

<$$heading>

The ascendent sothly, as wel in alle nativites as in questions and
eleccions of tymes, is a thing which that these astrologiens gretly
observen.  Wherfore me semeth convenyent, syth that I speke of the
ascendent, to make of it speciall declaracioun.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.258

The ascendent sothly, to take it at the largest, is thilke degre
that ascendith at eny of these forseide tymes upon the est orisounte.
CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.259

And therfore, yf that eny planete ascende at thatt same tyme in
thilke forseide degre, than hath he no latitude fro the ecliptik lyne,
CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.260

but he is than in the degre of the ecliptik which that is the degre of
his longitude.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.261

Men sayn that thilke planete is in horoscopo.  CMASTRO-M3,670.C2.262

But sothly the hous of the ascendent, that is to seyn, the first
hous or the est angle, is a <P_671.C1> thing more brod and large.
CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.263

For, after the statutes of astrologiens, what celestial body that is
5 degrees above thilke degre that ascendith, or withinne that nombre,
that is to seyn neer the degree that ascendith, yit rekne they thilke
planete in the ascendent.  CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.264

And what planete that is under thilke degre that ascendith the space of
25 degres, yit seyn thei that thilke planete is"like to him that is the
hous of the ascendent. "CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.265

But sothly, if he passe the boundes of these forseide spaces, above
or bynethe, thei seyn that the planete is"fallyng fro the ascendent.
"CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.266

Yit saien these astrologiens that the ascendent and eke the lord of
the ascendent may be shapen for to be fortunat or infortunat, as thus:
CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.267

A"fortunat ascendent"clepen they whan that no wicked planete, as Saturne
or Mars or elles the Tayl of the Dragoun, is in the hous of the ascendent,
ne that no wicked planete have noon aspect of enemyte upon the ascendent.
CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.268

But thei wol caste that thei have a fortunat planete in hir ascendent,
and yit in his felicite; CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.269

and than sey thei that it is wel.  CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.270

Further over thei seyn that the infortunyng of an ascendent is the
contrarie of these forseide thinges.  CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.271

The lord of the ascendent, sey thei that he is fortunat whan he is
in god place fro the ascendent, as in an angle, or in a succident
where as he is in hys dignite and comfortid with frendly aspectes of
planetes and wel resceyved; and eke that he may seen the ascendent;
and that he be not retrograd, ne combust, ne joyned with no shrewe in
the same signe; ne that he be not in his discencioun, ne joyned with no
planete in his descencioun, ne have upon him noon aspect infortunat ;
CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.272

and than sey thei that he is well.  CMASTRO-M3,671.C1.273

Natheles these ben observaunces of judicial matere and rytes of payens
, in whiche my <P_671.C2> spirit hath no feith, ne knowing of her
horoscopum.  CMASTRO-M3,671.C2.274

For they seyn that every signe is departid in thre evene parties by 10
degrees, CMASTRO-M3,671.C2.275

and thilke porcioun they clepe a face.  CMASTRO-M3,671.C2.276

And although that a planete have a latitude fro the ecliptik, yit sey
somme folk, so that the planete arise in that same signe with eny degre
of the forseide face in which his longitude is rekned, that yit is the
planete in horoscopo, be it in nativyte or in eleccion, etc.
