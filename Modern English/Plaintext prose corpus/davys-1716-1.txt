Act II.  DAVYS-1716-1,23.3

Scene <font> Lady <$$font> Ample <font>'s <$$font>.  DAVYS-1716-1,23.4

<$$heading>

<font> Lady <$$font> Ample, <font> Lady <$$font> Swish, <font> Lady
<$$font> Cordivant, <font> and Lady <$$font> Greasy, <font> set at
Breakfast, with hot Ale and Ginger, Butter, Rolls, a huge <$$font>
Cheshire <font> Cheese, and a Plate of drunken Toast, before them.
<$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,23.6

L. <font> Swish.  <$$font> And as I was telling your Ladyship,
my Husband, Alderman <font> Swish <$$font>, lost three of his best
Customers, for refusing his Vote to Capt. <font> Flip.  <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,23.7

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> Aye, aye, $it $'s {TEXT:it's}
an easier Matter to lose one's Customers by refusing a Vote, than get
new ones by giving on't.  DAVYS-1716-1,23.8

L. <font> Am. <$$font> But, Madam, if the Alderman lost
his Customers, he gain'd his Cause; DAVYS-1716-1,23.9

and that was worth something.  DAVYS-1716-1,23.10

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> So it was, Madam; DAVYS-1716-1,23.11

and he that has got it, is an honest Gentleman.  DAVYS-1716-1,23.12

I promis'd him my Husband's Vote, when he was not at Home,
DAVYS-1716-1,23.13

and had much ado to make him stand to it; DAVYS-1716-1,23.14

but next Morning I had a Ham and a Hare sent me, DAVYS-1716-1,23.15

and that brought him over to my Side.  DAVYS-1716-1,23.16

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Marry, when my Husband's Worship was
alive, I got nothing for his Vote, but a Kiss, and a Couple of Congees,
DAVYS-1716-1,23.17

and thought my self hugely paid <P_24> too: DAVYS-1716-1,24.18

for he was a curious fine Gentleman, DAVYS-1716-1,24.19

and smelt like any Perfumer's Shop: DAVYS-1716-1,24.20

But I wish'd I had not seen him; DAVYS-1716-1,24.21

for I could not abide my own Husband for above a Month after.
DAVYS-1716-1,24.22

L. <font> Swish.  <$$font> Well, my Lady <font> Greasy <$$font>, if
you got nothing but a Kiss and a Compliment, your Neighbour, Mrs.
<font> Double <$$font>, got something else, DAVYS-1716-1,24.23

or $she $'s {TEXT:she's} fouly bely'd.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.24

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Nay, Ladies, if you introduce
Scandal, you invade the Rights of the Tea-Table; DAVYS-1716-1,24.25

and since you will have none of the Liquor, pray $let $'s {TEXT:let's}
have none of the Talk.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.26

Lady <font> Greasy <$$font>, why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you drink your Ale?
DAVYS-1716-1,24.27

$You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} let it be cold.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.28

I wish I had known of your coming, DAVYS-1716-1,24.29

I would have had something better for you.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.30

L. <font> Gre. <$$font> Indeed, my Lady, every Thing is
very good; DAVYS-1716-1,24.31

but I can drink no more, unless we had had a Bit of Flesh;
DAVYS-1716-1,24.32

a Collop of Bacon, or hung Beef, would have done well.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.33

L. <font> Am. <$$font> I am sorry I am no better provided
of suitable Meat for such Stomachs.  <bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font>
<$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,24.34

But if you will please to stay the frying of an Egg and a Collop, my
Maid shall do it in a Motion.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.35

L. <font> Swish.  <$$font> No, Madam, by no Means;
DAVYS-1716-1,24.36

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} too late now: DAVYS-1716-1,24.37

But where is the young Gentlewoman that we came to drink with:
DAVYS-1716-1,24.38

Must we not have her good Company, to take a Cup of hotted Ale with us?
DAVYS-1716-1,24.39

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Yes, yes, Madam, she will be here
presently; DAVYS-1716-1,24.40

she happens to be up this Morning, which is a Wonder; DAVYS-1716-1,24.41

for she is one of those that loves no Companion in the Morning so well
as her Bed.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.42

And I am sure such Company must needs confirm her in her Choice.
<bracket> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,24.43

But here she comes.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.44

<font> Enter <$$font> Isabella <font>, DAVYS-1716-1,24.45

all rise but Lady <$$font> Greasy.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.46

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Sweet Mrs. <font> Isbel
<$$font>, pray excuse me; DAVYS-1716-1,24.47

for I have got such a Pain in my Huck-bone, that when I am once set,
I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} get up again.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.48

<font> Isa. <$$font> Pray, Ladies, be pleas'd to sit.
DAVYS-1716-1,24.49

I suppose, Madam, you have got a Cold in your Hip.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.50

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> No, Mrs. <font> Isbel
<$$font>, I have had it a great while, DAVYS-1716-1,24.51

and they tell me $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} a Certificate.  DAVYS-1716-1,24.52

L. <font> Am. <$$font> I rather fancy, Madam, it is a
<font> Sciatica.  <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,24.53

<P_25>

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Nay, I know not, DAVYS-1716-1,25.55

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} some hard Word; DAVYS-1716-1,25.56

but whatever they call it, I am sure I feel it.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.57

<font> <paren> Belches <$$paren> <$$font> Oh!  wo worth this Wind,
DAVYS-1716-1,25.58

it just overcomes me.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.59

<font> Isa. Aside.  <$$bracket> <$$font> Aye, and every Body else,
a nasty Pole-Cat.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.60

<font> To Lady <$$font> Ample.  Madam, have you no Brandy for my Lady ;
DAVYS-1716-1,25.61

<bracket> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$bracket> for I fancy $that $'s
{TEXT:that's} what she would be at.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.62

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Aye, Mrs. <font> Isbel
{COM:sic} <$$font>, you know $what $'s {TEXT:what's} good for an old
Woman.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.63

Truly I never us'd to drink Brandy'til now of late, that I have been
troubled with an Expression at my Stomach.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.64

<font> Isa. Aside.  <$$bracket> <$$font> So, this is like her
Certificate.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.65

She has abundance of new Distempers.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.66

Ladies, will any of you drink a Dish of Tea this Morning?
DAVYS-1716-1,25.67

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> No, Mrs. <font>
Isbel <$$font>, no; we are for none of your far-fetch'd Liquors.
DAVYS-1716-1,25.68

Tea!  what is it good for, but to swill one's Guts, scald the Teeth out,
and never warm the Heart.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.69

No, I thank you, DAVYS-1716-1,25.70

we are for none of your Tea.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.71

<font> Isa. <$$font> I doubt, Madam, $you $'re {TEXT:you're}
not sociable, if you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} drink Tea.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.72

I am sure you are in a Neighbourhood where they drink a great deal.
DAVYS-1716-1,25.73

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Yes, yes, but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
like'em; DAVYS-1716-1,25.74

they are too proud, DAVYS-1716-1,25.75

and knows not how to behave themselves to their Betters.
DAVYS-1716-1,25.76

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} one of them but a Knight's Wife,
DAVYS-1716-1,25.77

and she, forsooth, must sit above me, tho'my Husband was a Lord; nay,
one of the best Sort of Lords, DAVYS-1716-1,25.78

he was Lord-Mayor.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.79

L. <font> Swish.  <$$font> Aye, and another proud Flirt jostled
me from the Head of the Table, tho'her Husband was but a paultry Officer,
a Colonel, or some such Thing.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.80

<font> Isa. Aside.  <$$bracket> <$$font> I have not Patience with
those ignorant Brutes.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.81

Ladies, you speak with too much Contempt.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.82

There are a great many fine Gentlemen in the Army, that behave themselves
with as much good Manners and Gallantry at Home, as Bravery and Honour
Abroad.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.83

L. <font> Swish.  <$$font> Aye, aye; I know you young Ladies like
their fine Fringes and Feathers.  DAVYS-1716-1,25.84

But what do you think of Captain <font> Tinsel <$$font>, Madam?
DAVYS-1716-1,25.85

<font> Isa. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know much of him;
DAVYS-1716-1,25.86

but allowing him to be a Man of no Worth, would you condemn a <P_26>
whole Society because they happen to have one Scoundrel among'em.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.87

<font> Enter a Servant.  <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,26.88

<font> Serv. <$$font> Madam, Sir <font> Jeffrey Hearty <$$font>
is just alighted, DAVYS-1716-1,26.89

and desires to know if your Ladyship be at Leisure.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.90

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Wait on him up Stairs.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.91

<bracket> <font> Exit Serv. <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,26.92

$You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} pardon the Freedom I take, Ladies, in introducing
a Stranger into your Company, DAVYS-1716-1,26.93

but he is a Relation, and a Country Gentleman, one that $wo $n't
{TEXT:won't} overload you with Complements {COM:sic}, I dare promise you.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.94

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Jeffrey.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.95

L. <font> Am. <$$font> $You $'re {TEXT:You're} welcome to
<font> York, <$$font> Sir <font> Jeffrey.  <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,26.96

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Cousin <font> Ample <$$font>, I am yours.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.97

Cousin <font> Bella <$$font>, I am glad to see you.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.98

Ladies, your humble Servant.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.99

<bracket> <font> Salutes them all.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
DAVYS-1716-1,26.100

Aye, this is like the good $old-fashion'd {TEXT:old_fashion'd} Way of
House-keeping.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.101

I expected to have found you all set round a Table no bigger than a
Past-board, and not much stronger, by my Troth, with a Parcel of little
Crocks, that hold no more than a Girl would drink before her Sweet-heart.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.102

Come, have you left any Thing, that a Man may partake with you?
DAVYS-1716-1,26.103

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Aye, Sir, you Brede of me;
DAVYS-1716-1,26.104

you and I shou'd do mains weell together.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.105

I am for something in my Stomach that will keep out the Wind, and
not swill my Guts with hot Water,'till one may hear it swash as I go.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.106

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Truly, Madam, you are in the right on't.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.107

The Women in this Age mind nothing but their Pleasure, DAVYS-1716-1,26.108

and study nothing but how to consume their Husband's Money.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.109

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Rise at Noon.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.110

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Dine at Night.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.111

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Go to Bed in the Morning.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.112

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> As soon as $thay $'re {TEXT:thay're} up,
call <font> Jenny <$$font> to hang on the Tea-Kettle, and bring them a
clear-starch'd Muslin Apron.  DAVYS-1716-1,26.113

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Aye; and for fear it should keep
too long clean, the Dog with his mucky Paws must be laid upon it.
DAVYS-1716-1,26.114

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> When the $Tea $'s {TEXT:Tea's} ready
they sit down, DAVYS-1716-1,26.115

and eat and drink'till they are ready to burst; DAVYS-1716-1,26.116

and then <P_27> their Husbands or Fathers must pity them, because they
can eat no Dinner.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.117

<font> Isa. <$$font> I wonder, Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>, how
you, that live in the Country, come to be so well acquainted with the
Behaviour of the Ladies of <font> York!  <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,27.118

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Oh, Madam, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} not
the first Time I have been among the Ladies of <font> York.  <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,27.119

As soon as the $Cloth $'s {TEXT:Cloth's} taken away, thay dispatch a
Courier to three or four Idlers, like themselves, to make up a Set at Lue,
at which, when thay have lost all their Money, and fall'n out, thay begin
to dress for the Assembly.  L. <font> Am. <$$font> Where,
as Mr. <font> Congreve <$$font> says, the Coroner's Inquest fits
upon all the murder'd Reputations of the Town.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.120

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> True, Madam.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.121

<font> Isa. <$$font> But pray, Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>,
how must your Spouse behave herself when you get her?  DAVYS-1716-1,27.122

If she must rise at four to look after her Dairy, and keep undress'd
herself to dress your Dinner, I think she might as well have taken one
of your Tenants as your self; DAVYS-1716-1,27.123

for Nature has made no Difference betwixt a Gentlewoman and a
Kitchen-Wench; DAVYS-1716-1,27.124

it is the Sweets of Life that has done it, DAVYS-1716-1,27.125

and if we must not enjoy them, they are of no Use.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.126

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Well said, my little <font> Bell.
<$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,27.127

Come, come, you and I must talk again about this Matter.
DAVYS-1716-1,27.128

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Pray, my Lady <font> Ample <$$font>
, will you call your Maid, that we may know what Bread and Ale we have
had; DAVYS-1716-1,27.129

for I must needs be going.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.130

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Ladies, I should take it as the
greatest Mark of your Favour, if you would dispense with the Custom of
the Town for once, and let this little Treat be mine.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.131

L. <font> Swish.  <$$font> By no Means, Madam; DAVYS-1716-1,27.132

I had as lieve break a Leg or an Arm, as an old Custom.
DAVYS-1716-1,27.133

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> No, my Lady, no; DAVYS-1716-1,27.134

this has been a Custom Time out of Mind.  DAVYS-1716-1,27.135

Our ancient and loyal City of <font> York <$$font>, has always been
famous for keeping up an hearty and neighbourly Way among our selves,
which keeps us all Friends; DAVYS-1716-1,27.136

for eating, as well as lying together, makes Folks love.
DAVYS-1716-1,27.137

<P_28>

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Well, Ladies, if it must be so, I
had better submit my single Opinion, than oppose so many superior ones.
DAVYS-1716-1,28.139

Here, <font> Susan <$$font>, bring a Plate, DAVYS-1716-1,28.140

and let us know what Bread and Ale we have had.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.141

Sir <font> Jef. Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> How much Bread
and Ale!  DAVYS-1716-1,28.142

what a Plague do they mean?  DAVYS-1716-1,28.143

<font> Enter <$$font> Susan <font> with a Plate.  <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,28.144

<font> Su. <$$font> $There $'s {TEXT:There's} four Quarts
of Country Ale, one of strong Beer, and three Pennyworth of Bread.
DAVYS-1716-1,28.145

L. <font> Cor. <$$font> $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee}, Barn,
tell us how much it comes to; DAVYS-1716-1,28.146

for we are no great Reckoners.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.147

<font> Su. Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> No, so it seems, by
my Troth.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.148

Madam, it comes to just two and nine Pence.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.149

L. <font> Gr. takes the Plate.  <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,28.150

Come then, our Twelvepence a-piece does it, DAVYS-1716-1,28.151

and $there $'s {TEXT:there's} something for the Maid.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.152

<font> Su. Aside.  <$$font> <$$bracket> Take two and nine Pence
out of three Shilling, DAVYS-1716-1,28.153

and what remains?  DAVYS-1716-1,28.154

A Pox on their Threepenny Present.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.155

<bracket> <font> The Ladies get up, DAVYS-1716-1,28.156

and take their Leaves.  <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,28.157

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> Susan.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.158

L. <font> Gr. <$$font> Good Morrow, my good Lady <font>
Ample <$$font>, DAVYS-1716-1,28.159

and thank you for me.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.160

Sweet Mrs. <font> Isbel <$$font>, your Servant, DAVYS-1716-1,28.161

Servant Sir.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.162

<bracket> <font> Exeunt <$$font> Ladies.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.163

<font> Isa. <$$font> So, Thanks to my Stars, I am rid of my Plague.
DAVYS-1716-1,28.164

I had rather sit in the Stocks all Day, and hear the Mob sing Ballads
, than be consin'd to the Impertinence of those worshipful Ladies.
DAVYS-1716-1,28.165

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Why what a Pox, DAVYS-1716-1,28.166

Cousin <font> Ample <$$font>, do you invite Folks to your House, and
then make them pay the Reckoning.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.167

Belike I shall have my Beer to pay for by and by.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.168

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha: No, Sir <font> Jeffrey,
<$$font> you shall come off scot-free, I warrant you.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.169

I would not, you see, have taken their Money, but in Compliance to
a foolish Custom, of which they are very fond, tho'they pay for't.
DAVYS-1716-1,28.170

You might have minded my Opposition put'em into a mighty Stickle in
Defence of their Privileges.  DAVYS-1716-1,28.171

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> A foolish Custom, $quoth $he
{TEXT:quotha}!  DAVYS-1716-1,28.172

Is it your Custom to go to one another's Houses, guzzle five or six
Quarts of Ale, and then club round to pay for't?  DAVYS-1716-1,28.173

<P_29>

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Nay, Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>
, if you find Fault with our Proceedings, you must no more be admitted
into our Society.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.175

I do assure you, this Humour prevails all the Town over,
DAVYS-1716-1,29.176

and every trivial Occasion brings them together.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.177

<font> Isa. <$$font> Aye, aye, if a Friend comes to Town, they
come to drink with you for Joy; DAVYS-1716-1,29.178

if they go out of Town, they come to help you to wash away Sorrow;
so that the good People are resolv'd to share both your Pleasure and
your Pain, provided they may have a little Victuals and Drink to keep
up their Spirits.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.179

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> I have often heard of the Gossips of
<font> York <$$font>, DAVYS-1716-1,29.180

but never saw any of'em before.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.181

Pray what extraordinary Occasion brought'em here $today {TEXT:to_Day}.
DAVYS-1716-1,29.182

<font> Isa. <$$font> They came, I thank'em, to drink with me,
as they call it.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.183

$Tomorrow {TEXT:To_Morrow}, I suppose, Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>,
they will come and drink you to Town.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.184

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Gad's Bud, I would they would, by the
Lord Harry, DAVYS-1716-1,29.185

$I $'d {TEXT:I'd} make'em a Boul of Punch should send'em Home so chirping
merry, they should remember me'till I came again; DAVYS-1716-1,29.186

and then, if they would, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} make'em another.
DAVYS-1716-1,29.187

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Truly, Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>
, I believe if some of'em knew your Mind, they would go near to take
you at your Word; DAVYS-1716-1,29.188

for they $do $n't {TEXT:don't} love Tea.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.189

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Well, my little Bell, how many Sweethearts
hast got?  DAVYS-1716-1,29.190

Come, I doubt $you $'re {TEXT:you're} hard to please.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.191

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Aye, Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>
, so she is.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.192

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Come, I believe I must bring her one from
the Races, a brisk young Fellow that can leap over a five barr'd Gate,
either a Foot or a Horseback; can hollow after a Pack of Dogs, without
straining his lungs; and gallop after a Hare, without breaking the Neck.
DAVYS-1716-1,29.193

What say you to that, my Lass?  DAVYS-1716-1,29.194

<font> Isa. <$$font> I say Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>, you have
not describ'd the Man I like, DAVYS-1716-1,29.195

I should be better pleas'd with one that lov'd less violent Exercises,
and gave me less Fears in his Absence; DAVYS-1716-1,29.196

for whatever Pleasure he might take Abroad, I am sure I should not have
much at Home, when I came to consider his Danger.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.197

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Well said, my little <font> Bell;
<$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,29.198

by my Troth, that Answer is worth a Pint of Sack.  DAVYS-1716-1,29.199

Why thou <P_30> hast too much good Nature in thee for a modern Wife,
DAVYS-1716-1,30.200

and vow to Gad I believe will love thy Husband.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.201

<font> Isa. <$$font> It is no Shame to love a good Man, Sir <font>
Jeffrey; <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,30.202

and if he that Heaven has allotted me, prove worthy of that Character,
I should deserve a very ill one my self, if any Thing were wanting on
my Side, to contribute to his Happiness.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.203

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> Gad, I have a good {TEXT:good_a} Mind
to court thee my self.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.204

Come, Come, what signifies twenty or thirty Years Difference;
DAVYS-1716-1,30.205

<font> Isa. <$$font> No, Sir, I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} promise
to be equally complaisant to all Men alike neither; DAVYS-1716-1,30.208

for as I am resolv'd to love the Man I marry, I am resolv'd to marry
the Man I love; DAVYS-1716-1,30.209

for Love, like Charity, covers a Multitude of Faults.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.210

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Sir <font> Jeffrey <$$font>, will

Sir <font> Jef. <$$font> With all my Heart; DAVYS-1716-1,30.213

and if I can but bring my little <font> Bell <$$font> to have a good
Opinion of me, I shall go near to make the Pudding a Pound lighter.
DAVYS-1716-1,30.214

I am going now to <font> Ned Grey's <$$font>, to meet a Friend about

you $can $n't {TEXT:can't} say the Races have brought you nothing.
DAVYS-1716-1,30.219

<font> Isa. <$$font> No, Madam; DAVYS-1716-1,30.220

but I can say they have brought me something worse than nothing.
DAVYS-1716-1,30.221

It will be very hard if my Person and Fortune can command nothing better
than an old Country Knight.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.222

L. <font> Am. <$$font> True, Child; DAVYS-1716-1,30.223

but that you need not fear: DAVYS-1716-1,30.224

For if your Person should want Attractives, your twenty thousand Pounds

<font> Mahomet's <$$font> Load-stone never drew with a more magnetick
Force.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.226

Besides, you forget Sir <font> Loobily Joddrel <$$font>, a Man young

Isa. <$$font> Hold, dear Madam, DAVYS-1716-1,30.228

I am so afraid you should out-run the Constable; DAVYS-1716-1,30.229

I suppose the next Thing would have been his Wit.  DAVYS-1716-1,30.230

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Well, you jearing Baggage, if he
be not so <P_31> very quick in his Understanding, as your Favourite
<font> Gamont <$$font>, he has an Estate and Title to make amends for't.
DAVYS-1716-1,31.231

<font> Isa. <$$font> What an Unhappiness it is, that our Relations
never consult any Thing but the Pleasure of Wealth?  DAVYS-1716-1,31.232

$Me $thinks {TEXT:Methinks}, Madam, you that have a Taste for Wit,
should never prefer a Fool to a Man of Sense; DAVYS-1716-1,31.233

but you force me to say, Sir <font> Loobily <$$font> must never
hope to succeed, where <font> Gamont <$$font> thinks fit to address.
DAVYS-1716-1,31.234

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Well, <font> Isabella <$$font>,
I can but advise; DAVYS-1716-1,31.235

and if you think fit to reject such an Estate, the Folly will be yours.

Oh!  what a Morning have I had?  DAVYS-1716-1,31.241

First deafen'd with an impertinent Crew of old Women, DAVYS-1716-1,31.242

then teaz'd with Love from an old Man; DAVYS-1716-1,31.243

then lectur'd in Behalf of a Fool; DAVYS-1716-1,31.244

and last of all, and worst of all, persecuted by my own Thoughts in
Favour of one that does not deserve that Character.  DAVYS-1716-1,31.245

No, <font> Gamont <$$font>, thy Qualifications are without Objection;
DAVYS-1716-1,31.246

For my Part, I was so surpriz'd and confounded, that I knew not what

every Body a Dish of hot Water.  DAVYS-1716-1,34.357

<font> Isa. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha, what said <font> Gamont?  <$$font>
DAVYS-1716-1,34.358

<font> Lou. <$$font> Why he saw we were both in Disorder,
DAVYS-1716-1,34.359

and laugh'd at us accordingly.  DAVYS-1716-1,34.360

<font> Isa. <$$font> I almost fancy this Mr. <font>
Welby <$$font> has done a Work in a few Hours, which a Parcel of baffled
Bunglers have been forc'd to give over, after as many Years vain Attempts.
DAVYS-1716-1,34.361

<font> Lou. <$$font> Nay, I know not what he has done;
DAVYS-1716-1,34.362

but if his Estate and Humour prove of a Piece with his Wit and Person,
Heaven of it's Mercy defend my Heart; DAVYS-1716-1,34.363

for I am sure I shall never be able to do it my self.  DAVYS-1716-1,34.364

<font> Isa. <$$font> He had need to be a Man of more than common

Well, as you say, if his Estate does but answer the rest, I am in great

Matrimony by my dear <font> Louisa.  <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,35.366

<font> Lou. <$$font> Were I sure you would follow, as I would have
you, I should not care how soon I led up the Dance; DAVYS-1716-1,35.367

but you starve poor <font> Gamont's <$$font> generous Love, for want of
Hopes to keep it warm.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.368

<font> Isa. $Gamont $'s {TEXT:Gamont's} <$$font> particular,
if he wants Hopes.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.369

Most Men have so good an Opinion of their own Worth, that they often hope,
when they have very little Reason for it?  DAVYS-1716-1,35.370

<font> Lou. <$$font> Aye, but he is not one of them;
DAVYS-1716-1,35.371

but, on the contrary, has given himself so entirely away, that a
Disappointment must of Necessity be fatal.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.372

<font> Isa. <$$font> Indeed, <font> Louisa <$$font>, I doubt you
promise and vow more in his Name, than he will ever be able to make good.
DAVYS-1716-1,35.373

I know he is a Man of much Gallantry, DAVYS-1716-1,35.374

and I should be a Woman of little Conduct, should I take Notice of it.
DAVYS-1716-1,35.375

<font> Lou..  <$$font> Why so, my Dear?  DAVYS-1716-1,35.376

<font> Isa. <$$font> Because it is a general Thing;
DAVYS-1716-1,35.377

every Man makes Love to every Woman he sees.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.378

For my part, I only expect it in my Turn, DAVYS-1716-1,35.379

and shall accordingly receive it.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.380

<font> Lou. <$$font> Phu, phu, this must be Affectation in you;
because you know your Merit commands Sincerity.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.381

<font> Isa. <$$font> Indeed, <font> Louisa <$$font>, I never had
Vanity enough to think any Thing, but my Money, could secure a Heart;
DAVYS-1716-1,35.382

but if <font> Gamont <$$font> be so much in Love as you would insinuate,
$he $'s {TEXT:he's} in a dangerous Case; DAVYS-1716-1,35.383

for he has a powerful Rival come to Town.  DAVYS-1716-1,35.384

Well, my Dear, do you think of going to the Assembly after the Races?

<font> Isa. <$$font> No: If your Inclination jumps with mine, $we

<font> Isa. Gamont <$$font> may bring his old Friend with him,
DAVYS-1716-1,36.404

and then I shall have an Opportunity of giving my Opinion of your
new Spark.  DAVYS-1716-1,36.405

<font> Lou. <$$font> Aye; but will it be safe to bring you
together?  DAVYS-1716-1,36.406

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know but you may rob me of a Spark, and <font>

<font> Isa. <$$font> No, no, there can be no Danger of that,
DAVYS-1716-1,36.408

<font> Louisa <$$font> does not use to make half Conquests.
DAVYS-1716-1,36.409

Scene <font> continues <$$font>.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.426

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Isabella <font> and <$$font> Liddy.
DAVYS-1716-1,37.428

<font> Isa. <$$font> $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} Pity Nature did not
change thy Sex, and Fortune thy Vocation; DAVYS-1716-1,37.429

thou wouldst have made an admirable Lawyer; DAVYS-1716-1,37.430

for I find, as it is, you can speak for your Fee.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.431

<font> Lid. <$$font> If I have taken too great a Freedom, Madam,
I hope your Ladyship will pardon it, DAVYS-1716-1,37.432

$'t $was {TEXT:'twas} an Effect of my Zeal.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.433

<font> Isa. <$$font> Yes, Zeal for <font> Gamont;
DAVYS-1716-1,37.434

<$$font> but if you had any for my Interest, you would rather persuade
me from him, than take such Pains in his Behalf.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.435

You know as well as I he has no Estate.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.436

<font> Lid. <$$font> True, Madam; DAVYS-1716-1,37.437

but your Ladyship knows, and so do I too, he must have one e'er long;
DAVYS-1716-1,37.438

his old Father must in a little Time resign both it and Life,
DAVYS-1716-1,37.439

and then - DAVYS-1716-1,37.440

<font> Isa. <$$font> And then perhaps he will be as imperious as
he is now submissive; DAVYS-1716-1,37.441

therefore say no more, DAVYS-1716-1,37.442

for I am resolv'd to be satisfy'd: DAVYS-1716-1,37.443

My Person comes at least upon a Level with my Money, DAVYS-1716-1,37.444

or I must give up all Thoughts of him for ever.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.445

<font> Lid. Aside.  <$$font> Aye, but, Heaven be prais'd, $that
$'s {TEXT:that's} out of your Power; DAVYS-1716-1,37.446

you love him too well for that.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.447

Well, Madam, I shou'd be glad to have you satisfy'd, DAVYS-1716-1,37.448

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what Method you can take to be so.
DAVYS-1716-1,37.449

<font> Isa. <$$font> I can do nothing without thy Help.
DAVYS-1716-1,37.450

I heard you say once, you could write a good Man's Hand.
DAVYS-1716-1,37.451

<font> Lid. <$$font> Yes, Madam, if that will be of any Service
to you, so I can.  DAVYS-1716-1,37.452

<font> Isa. <$$font> Of very considerable Service:
DAVYS-1716-1,37.453

This very Man's Hand of yours must be employ'd in writing a Letter from
my Unkle <font> Richlove <$$font> in <font> London <$$font> to me here
at <font> York <$$font>, to let me know that Alderman <font> Brittle
<$$font>, in whose Hands my Money is, is broke, and gone off with all.
DAVYS-1716-1,37.454

<P_38>

<font> Lid. <$$font> I understand your Ladyship:
DAVYS-1716-1,38.456

Then if Mr. <font> Gamont - <$$font> DAVYS-1716-1,38.457

<font> Isa. <$$font> Aye, then if <font> Gamont <$$font> proves
the Man I wish him, and you believe him, to be, my Person and Fortune
are his; DAVYS-1716-1,38.458

but if I find any Alteration, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} immediately give my
self to another before his Face.  DAVYS-1716-1,38.459

<font> Lid. <$$font> And so to revenge your self on a Man you
only fancy does not love you, you will give your self away to one you
are sure you hate.  DAVYS-1716-1,38.460

<font> Isa. <$$font> Yes; DAVYS-1716-1,38.461

and it would be less Mortification to lie in the Arms of one I $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} love, who I am sure loves me, than be consin'd to one I do,
and have no Return but Indifference.  DAVYS-1716-1,38.462

<font> Lid. <$$font> Your Prudence, Madam, is not to be disputed
by me; DAVYS-1716-1,38.463

but if I were to be hang'd for it, I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} forbear

DAVYS-1716-1,38.464

<font> Isa. Liddy <$$font>, no more; DAVYS-1716-1,38.465

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go this Minute and write the Letter for you to copy

what to do in this critical Case.  DAVYS-1716-1,38.469

To tell Mr. <font> Gamont <$$font>, would be to betray my Lady,
DAVYS-1716-1,38.470

and Treachery I scorn.  DAVYS-1716-1,38.471

Yet if I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} tell him, nothing but Mischief can be
the Event.  DAVYS-1716-1,38.472

For to say the Truth, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think his Love runs so
high as she expects; DAVYS-1716-1,38.473

Come, $pray $thee {TEXT:prithee} tell me, DAVYS-1716-1,39.497

<font> Lid. <$$font> Upon my Word, Sir, no Body has said any
Thing to your Disadvantage; DAVYS-1716-1,39.499

your Fate lies wholly in your own Behaviour, which must be manag'd with
Circumspection, DAVYS-1716-1,39.500

or your Case may prove a little desperate.  DAVYS-1716-1,39.501

either speak to be understood, DAVYS-1716-1,39.503

or say nothing.  DAVYS-1716-1,39.504

In the mean Time, let Love and Honour be your Guide: DAVYS-1716-1,39.509

But ask me no more Questions; DAVYS-1716-1,39.510

for I can only wish you knew what I dare not tell you.

the Present Tense.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.595

Mr. <font> Gamont <$$font>, I think you are dull $today
{TEXT:to_Day}; DAVYS-1716-1,42.596

I see Extreams never last: DAVYS-1716-1,42.597

Your Joy at the Sight of your Friend here has been so great, that it
has spent its Force, and left you your own Reverse.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.598

<font> Enter <$$font> Liddy <font> with the Letter.  <$$font>

and seems disorder'd.  <$$font> <$$bracket> DAVYS-1716-1,42.603

Lover; DAVYS-1716-1,42.604

and $she $'s {TEXT:she's} vex'd that I have seen it.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.605

A Billet-Doux, Madam, from a happy Lover.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.606

<font> Isa. <$$font> No, Mr. <font> Gamont <$$font> $it

DAVYS-1716-1,42.622

I am sorry for't, for more Reasons than one.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.623

I suppose this will put a full Stop to your Amour; DAVYS-1716-1,42.624

What will you do?  DAVYS-1716-1,42.625

<font> Gam. <$$font> Do?  DAVYS-1716-1,42.626

I know not what to do; DAVYS-1716-1,42.627

to go abruptly off will be base, because she made no Scruple of my
Circumstances before this happen'd; DAVYS-1716-1,42.628

and to persist, will be Folly and Madness.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.629

Ods Death I was never so puzzl'd in my Life.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.630

$Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} advise me.  DAVYS-1716-1,42.631

<font> Wel. <$$font> I know not how: DAVYS-1716-1,42.632

You must e'en pretend your Father has sent for you Home;
DAVYS-1716-1,42.633

I know no other Way, unless you art resolv'd to marry her right or wrong.
DAVYS-1716-1,42.634

<font> Gam. <$$font> No; for her Sake $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} not
marry her now; DAVYS-1716-1,42.635

but if she will be content to stay'till my Father dies, she shall

for tho'her Fortune began my first Liking, I have found something in
her Person very worthy of my Love: DAVYS-1716-1,42.637

Beside, it <P_43> would be the highest Ingratitude to leave her, if for
no other Reason but because I believe she loves me.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.638

<font> Wel. <$$font> I am glad to find you so generous a Lover;

DAVYS-1716-1,43.649

Egad this is the luckyest Discovery that ever was.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.650

<font> Wel. <$$font> It is so very lucky, that I $do $n't

<font> Gam. <$$font> Why then $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you;
DAVYS-1716-1,43.652

<font> Isabella <$$font>, I suppose, has taken it into her Head to grow
jealous of her own Fortune, DAVYS-1716-1,43.653

and, doubtless, fancies I like it better than her; upon which she has
contriv'd this Letter <paren> for it is her own Hand-Writing <$$paren>
as a Touch-stone for my Love.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.654

<font> Wel. <$$font> If you are sure it is her Hand, it must be
so; DAVYS-1716-1,43.655

and then, as you say, the Discovery is lucky enough.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.656

For, faith, I believe you would have made but an awkward Piece of Work
on't, if you had not had the old Encouragement to have gone on with.
DAVYS-1716-1,43.657

<font> Gam. <$$font> Nay, I know not what I should have done;
DAVYS-1716-1,43.658

but I am glad $it $'s {TEXT:it's} no worse.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.659

Yes, yes, her Hand, I am sure it is her Hand.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.660

Beside, I remember now her Maid told me, my Fate depended upon my own
Behaviour, bid me act with Circumspection, and let Love and Honour be
my Guide.  DAVYS-1716-1,43.661

DAVYS-1716-1,43.670

<font> Isa. <$$font> Well, Madam, what do you think of this
melancholy News; DAVYS-1716-1,43.671

are you convinc'd?  DAVYS-1716-1,43.672

L. <font> Am. <$$font> Why, Child, I wou'd have you to
make your self as easy as you can; DAVYS-1716-1,43.673

Misfortunes are very <P_44> common to the Inhabiters of this World;
DAVYS-1716-1,44.674

and you have good Friends to depend upon: DAVYS-1716-1,44.675

Beside, Sir <font> Loobily <$$font> will take you with all your Faults.
DAVYS-1716-1,44.676

{TEXT:can't} say, Madam, that I am glad at any Thing that gives you the
least Disquiet; DAVYS-1716-1,44.678

but I shall never look upon that as a Piece of ill Fortune, that gives
me so fair an Occasion of discovering how far my Passion is from being
mercenary.  DAVYS-1716-1,44.679

And, Madam, tho'while my Father lives, I have not an Estate that can
deserve you, yet if you can confine your self to my present Circumstances
$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} make you as happy as I can now, and be doubly joyful
when I have a Power to add to it.  DAVYS-1716-1,44.680

<font> Isa. aside.  <$$font> This is better than I expected.
DAVYS-1716-1,44.681

No, Mr. <font> Gamont <$$font>, it would be a Pity to involve
you in my Misfortunes.  DAVYS-1716-1,44.682

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} e'en content my self with a private single Life,
DAVYS-1716-1,44.683

and you shall always have my best Wishes, to be as happy as your
Generosity deserves.  DAVYS-1716-1,44.684

<font> Gam. <$$font> Madam, Happiness and a Separation from you

Sir <font> Loo. <$$font> Why, Friend, $that $'s {TEXT:that's}
true, DAVYS-1716-1,45.719

but my Horse is to run $today {TEXT:to_Day}, DAVYS-1716-1,45.720

Why, I hope there was no Harm in what I said, was there?
DAVYS-1716-1,45.735
