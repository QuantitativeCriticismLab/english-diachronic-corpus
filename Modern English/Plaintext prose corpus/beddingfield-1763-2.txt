<font> Evidence for the King.  <$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.60

Elizabeth Cleobald, <font> Sworn.  <$$font> <$$heading> Says, that she
was servant to the deceased, <font> John Beddingfield, <$$font> and
went to live with him at <font> Michaelmas <$$font> was a twelvemonth.
That on the twenty-seventh of <font> July <$$font> last, the time he

<$$font> use familiarities.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.61

Mr. <font> Serjeant Forster, <$$font> <bracket> for the Prisoner
<font> Beddingfield.  <$$font> <$$bracket> <font> My Lord, <$$font>
We object to any evidence of familiarities, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.62

it is out of the question now.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.63

The objection was over-ruled, they being circumstances tending to prove
her consenting and abetting.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.64

<heading>

<font> Witness.  <$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.66

<$$heading>

<font> Ringe <$$font> and my mistress were frequently together when my
master was out.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.68

They used to be alone in the kitchen when all the other servants were out.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.69

It used to be after dinner, when I used to be in the back kitchen.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.70

If my master was not at home, then <font> Ringe <$$font> would be along
with my mistress till two o'clock.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,8.71

He used to come home to dinner at twelve, from the fields where <P_9>
he worked.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.72

One night I sat up to brew.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.73

My mistress sat up.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.74

I went in to see what was o'clock, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.75

and my mistress was sitting upon <font> Richard <$$font>'s lap.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.76

This was two or three months before my master's death.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.77

Another time, my master was out, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.78

and I saw my mistress writing a letter.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.79

She desired me to carry it to <font> Richard.  <$$font>
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.80

I carried it.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.81

He was in bed.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.82

It was in the morning.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.83

This was between the time of the brewing, and my master's death.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.84

Another time I went into the kitchen-chamber, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.85

my mistress was putting her cap on.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.86

She desired me to put her ear-rings in.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.87

She said it would not be long before she would want a pair of black
ear-rings.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.88

<font> Richard <$$font> upon this said to her, are you going into mourning
for the devil?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.89

I left them two in the room.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.90

My master was gone to the next town.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.91

One day she said, somebody would die before <font> Michaelmas.  <$$font>
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.92

She thought it would be my master.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.93

I said I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell how long my master will live.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.94

My mistress said, Why do you think he will not die before then?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.95

I said, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell how long my master has to live.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.96

I saw <font> Richard <$$font> kiss my mistress: BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.97

this was a little time before my master's death.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.98

My master died the twenty-seventh of <font> July, <$$font> in the night.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.99

I lay with my mistress in the kitchen-chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.100

She had lain two nights from my master.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.101

He lay in the parlour-chamber, which is next the kitchen-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.102

These are at the other end of the house from where the rest lay.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.103

The parlour-chamber is over the parlour, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.104

you go through the kitchen-chamber to go into the parlour-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.105

My mistress and I went to bed, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.106

my mistress went to bed first.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.107

My master was below with <font> Scarlet, <$$font> a butcher, drinking
some punch.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,9.108

<P_10>

I saw my master come into the kitchen-chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.110

We went to bed about ten.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.111

My master desired my mistress to lye in the parlour-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.112

She said she would not lie there.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.113

My master desired her.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.114

Then he went into the parlour-chamber, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.115

and got his cap, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.116

and came in again, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.117

and said to my mistress,'I did not tell you where I would lie,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.118

I said I would not lie there. 'BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.119

They wished one another good night.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.120

He went into the parlour-chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.121

I never saw him again alive.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.122

<font> Betty Riches, <$$font> my partner, sat up, to light my master up
to bed.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.123

She came up with my master, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.124

lighted him up stairs.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.125

She staid in the kitchen-chamber till my master went into the
parlour-chamber, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.126

and they bid one another good night.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.127

After they had bid one another good night, my master went into the
parlour-chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.128

The door of that chamber was left open.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.129

<font> Elizabeth Riches <$$font> went into the backhouse-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.130

My master seemed to be in health; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.131

I never saw him ill but of a cold.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.132

He was twenty-four years of age.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.133

He was a thin man, not very lean, a small man.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.134

After my master was gone, I fell asleep, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.135

I was up all the night before.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.136

I was taken with sleep.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.137

My mistress waked me between eleven and twelve.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.138

My mistress <font> fared <$$font> {COM:sic_dialectal_for_"seem"}
frightened, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.139

and said, what is the matter.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.140

I begged her to get up.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.141

I was very much surprized at the noise I heard in the parlour-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.142

It appeared as if somebody was in great distress in the parlour-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.143

It appeared as if somebody was in agony.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.144

I was frightened at the noise.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.145

It was a shrieking noise.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.146

I heard the noise the moment I waked.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.147

It did not last above a minute or two.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,10.148

I begged my mistress <P_11> to get up.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.149

- She said, we had better lay still.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.150

We both <font> laid <$$font> still.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.151

After this, I saw <font> Richard, <$$font> not above a minute or two
after I was awaked.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.152

I heard a noise.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.153

<font> Richard <$$font> came into the room.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.154

I saw him on that side of the bed where my mistress lay;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.155

there was no light in the room.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.156

I knew it was <font> Richard.  <$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.157

I knew him by his speech.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.158

When I just saw him, I raised myself in bed, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.159

and said, Master!  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.160

He said, hold your tongue; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.161

does any body know it but you two?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.162

I think my mistress answered No.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.163

<font> Richard <$$font> said, he is dead, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.164

and now I am easy.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.165

My mistress said, is he?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.166

I said to him, how came you here?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.167

He answered, I was forced to it.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.168

<font> Richard <$$font> stayed in the room till we had got some of our
cloaths on, and we had the rest in our hands.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.169

Then <font> Richard <$$font> said, he would go to his own chamber,
to be called up, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.170

and went down stairs.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.171

Neither my mistress nor I went into the parlour-chamber before we
went down.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.172

I think the parlour-chamber door was open.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.173

The head of my master's bed was against the wall that parted the two
chambers.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.174

My master's, bed was close against the door.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.175

Our bed was about three yards from his, over the kitchen, and his over
the parlour, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.176

and it was about as big as the square in this court.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.177

My mistress and I went to the backhouse-chamber, where <font> Riches
<$$font> lay; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.178

it is across the landing-place, in coming out of the kitchen-chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.179

My mistress said, <font> Betty, <$$font> never discover.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.180

I said no.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.181

<font> Elizabeth Riches <$$font> was called up.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.182

We were almost dressed.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.183

My mistress said, <font> Betty, <$$font> go call up <font> Richard,
<$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.184

something is the matter with your master.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.185

There was a wall between her room and <font> Richard <$$font>'s room,
a mortar wall.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.186

<font> Elizabeth Riches <$$font> called <font> Richard.  <$$font>
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.187

She called him again.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.188

He said, what the Devil is the matter with you now?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.189

<font> Elizabeth Riches <$$font> begged him to get up and come away.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.190

His chamber was over the backhouse.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.191

He got a tinderbox, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,11.192

<P_12>

and came into the backhouse-chamber, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.194

and struck a light.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.195

When he came into the backhouse-chamber he had his clothes on.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.196

My mistress desired him to go and look into the parlour-chamber,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.197

she believed something was the matter with his master.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.198

He did go, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.199

and in a little time, came back, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.200

and said his master was dead.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.201

My mistress seemed uneasy, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.202

and laid down on the bed with her cloaths on, till almost morning.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.203

My mistress, <font> Richard, <$$font> or somebody, sent <font> William
Masterson <$$font> to fetch my master's mother, who came before it
was light.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.204

<font> Ringe <$$font> went a second time into his master's room with
<font> Elizabeth Riches.  <$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.205

When my master's mother came, she asked, has the doctor been sent for?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.206

My mistress answered, if he is dead, what signifies sending for the
doctor?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.207

The next forenoon I saw my master, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.208

he was laid out, and a sheet thrown over him; over his face.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.209

I turned it down, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.210

and looked at him.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.211

His face was black, and his throat and his neck quite round.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.212

The next day the coroner came, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.213

I was examined before him, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.214

and spoke of hearing the groans, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.215

but said nothing of <font> Ringe, <$$font> because, as I was to stay in
the place till <font> Michaelmas, <$$font> was afraid my mistress would
use me ill.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.216

I continued till a week and three days before old <font> Michaelmas
<$$font> day, when it was discovered, at the time of <font> Saxmundham
<$$font> Sessions.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.217

My mistress then said to me, <font> Betty, <$$font> have you told any
body what you saw and heard between <font> Richard <$$font> and I,
touching your master, on account of his death?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.218

I said yes: BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.219

She said, to whom?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.220

I said, to my mother and <font> Elizabeth Riches.  <$$font>
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.221

My mistress said to <font> Richard, <$$font> now <font> Richard
, <$$font> you are done for, or hanged, or some such words.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.222

I then repeated to her what had passed in the chamber.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.223

My mistress said, you need not say what chamber;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.224

a chamber is a chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.225

I said, yes, madam, it was the kitchen-chamber that <font> Richard
<$$font> came into that night.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.226

Can you swear to <font> Richard?  <$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.227

I said I could; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,12.228

<P_13>

<font> Richard <$$font> was by then, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.230

and did not deny what I said.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.231

My mistress said to me, did not you say you would not say any thing?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.232

I said, yes, I said as little as I could.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.233

I did not know but I should have been ill used if I had, told what I knew.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.234

My mistress said, to make yourself easy, you will ruin two for ever.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.235

I said, if <font> Richard <$$font> never did my master any harm, he
would not be ruined in the world to come, whatever might happen in this.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.236

My mistress said, yes, he must be ruined for ever,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.237

for he has not had time to repent.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.238

My master and mistress lived happy together when I first went, and
till my mistress took to keeping company with <font> Richard <$$font>
; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.239

after that they did not live so happy as they did before.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.240

<font> Richard <$$font> wanted me to go to <font> Saxmundham, <$$font>
to have what I could say taken down, and for me to say what he would;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.241

but I refused.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.242

<font> Richard <$$font> asked me if I would swear he murdered my master
: BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,13.243

I said no, I should be loth to say that, but I must speak the truth.

Elizabeth Riches <font> Sworn.  <$$font> BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.263

<$$heading>

I lived with the decased, <font> John Beddingfield, <$$font> a year all
but a fortnight; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.265

one night <font> Richard <$$font> was sitting up for my master,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.266

my mistress was gone to bed, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.267

<font> Richard <$$font> said, he would get some poison, if I would
poison my master, by putting it into his rum and milk, which he drank
for breakfast.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.268

I told him I would not do it.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.269

He said he would be a friend to me as long as I lived, if I would
do it, and nobody would never know it, if I did not speak of it.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.270

I said, if it was hid in this world, it would not be hid in the world
to come.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.271

He said I might give it my master, he would swell, he would not die
immediately.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.272

<font> Richard <$$font> and my mistress kept company together,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.273

they met together, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.274

she has sat upon his lap when my master has been from home.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.275

One night I saw him kiss her three times in the back-house, and in the
kitchen, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.276

I have seen him in her bed-chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.277

I was ordered by my mistress to watch, when they two were together
, more than once, sometimes o'nights, and sometimes o'days.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.278

Once my mistress was writing - BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.279

She told me she was writing to <font> Richard.  <$$font>
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.280

My master was walking in the fields, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.281

she directed me to watch.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.282

My master was coming, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.283

and she whipt up the letter, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.284

and put it into her pocket.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.285

My master was to take a vomit about two months before his death.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.286

My master had a cold.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.287

They had told him they would have him take a vomit.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.288

He took it in a china cup.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.289

My master was gone to the plough.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.290

<font> Richard <$$font> brought the water in a little pudding-cup
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.291

My master was a healthy man - BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.293

never heard he had any fit.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.294

On the twenty-seventh of <font> July, <$$font> my master asked to lie
with my mistress -.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.295

She said no.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,14.296

My master went <P_15> into the parlour-chamber, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.297

put on his cap, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.298

and came back again.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.299

They wished one another good night, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.300

and my master went to the parlour-chamber.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.301

Afterwards I heard a little noise, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.302

I could not tell what it was, like as if children were crying.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.303

Then my mistress and <font> Elizabeth Cleobald <$$font> came into
the room.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.304

My mistress ordered me to call <font> Richard <$$font>;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.305

he lay in the next room to me, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.306

so did <font> William Masterson <$$font>; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.307

they lay in the same room, and a young boy.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.308

I sat up in the bed, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.309

and called <font> Richard, <$$font> for God's sake get up.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.310

He said, what the devil is the matter with you now?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.311

<font> Richard <$$font> lighted a candle, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.312

and went to my master; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.313

he came back, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.314

and said he was dead BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.315

.  I said, surely no.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.316

My mistress said, hold your tongue; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.317

it was enough to hurry her.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.318

I then went in with him, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.319

and found my master lying upon the floor, on the further side of the bed,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.320

he was upon the floor.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.321

His head lay at the foot of the bed.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.322

He lay upon his stomach.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.323

His shirt was on.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.324

There were two buttons off his shirt neck, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.325

it was rent out of the gathers.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.326

I did not observe this myself, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.327

<font> Richard <$$font> told me so.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.328

There was a little scar upon his neck, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.329

it was black before, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.330

and swelled.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.331

I saw his face that night, and his neck.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.332

The bed-curtain was down, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.333

and the rod was bent.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.334

The rod was not bent before.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,15.335

it was two days after he was dead.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.689

<font> Q. <$$font> Who sent for you?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.690

<font> A. <$$font> Mr. <font> Edgar <$$font> desired me
to go and view the body with him; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.691

it was then about twelve, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.692

they were in great hurry; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.693

the jury had been there a long time, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.694

particularly the coroner had been there so long he wanted to go home.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.695

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you see the body?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.696

<font> A. <$$font> Mr. <font> Edgar <$$font> stood on one
side of the bed, and I on the other; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.697

I turned the covering down pretty low to the waste,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.698

I found no marks, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.699

only it was much swelled, as any dead body is.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.700

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you go higher up in his body?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.701

<font> A. <$$font> I viewed his neck; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.702

after that I was at a loss.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.703

I saw such marks as I never saw before.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.704

I have seen bodies from the hall, marked all round.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,26.705

Here were marks with fingers on the one side, and a thumb on <P_27>
the other, with scratches, as if it had been done with a person's nails.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.706

<font> Q. <$$font> You had been used at <font> London <$$font>
to see <font> subjects <$$font> with black marks, that had been hanged?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.707

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, I was at a loss then, because it was not
a round regular mark, but two.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.708

<font> Q. <$$font> What was that?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.709

<font> A. <$$font> Fingers on one side, a thumb on the other,
with proper distances between each.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.710

<font> Q. <$$font> How many fingers?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.711

<font> A. <$$font> Three and a thumb.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.712

<font> Q. <$$font> Any scratches?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.713

<font> A. <$$font> Such as are made by the nails of a person.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.714

There was a slight redness upon the windpipe, but not such as is made
by fingers.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.715

<font> Q. <$$font> If fingers were applied as you saw, to occasion
them, would a force applied to them have prevented a man from breathing?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.716

<font> A. <$$font> A man could not do it himself;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.717

another might, by continuance, and by a perpetual squeezing.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.718

<font>

Q. <$$font> Suppose no resistance is made,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.720

if a man takes another with his fingers in that manner, would it prevent
his breathing?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.721

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, if it was continued.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.722

<font>

Q. <$$font> Suppose a man was asleep, and was seized in that
manner, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.724

what would be his defence?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.725

<font> A. <$$font> He could make very little.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.726

<font> Q. <$$font> If a person held his breath, could he make any?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.727

<font> A. <$$font> Very little.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.728

<font> Q. <$$font> From what you saw of that subject, do you
believe he died a natural death?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.729

<font> A. <$$font> I think they were marks of violence.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.730

<font> Q. <$$font> Do you think you saw marks enough to impute
his death to violence?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,27.731

<P_28>

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, by what I have heard since.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.733

<font> Q. <$$font> Did these marks that you saw upon the
neck , appear to be such marks as probably might occasion his death?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.734

<font> A. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know by what $I $'m
{TEXT:I'm} to judge.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.735

<font> Q. <$$font> Now do you think the marks of violence that
you saw, were the probable cause of his death?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.736

<font> A. <$$font> I really think so; BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.737

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} positively say.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.738

BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.742

<font> A. <$$font> I believe they told me;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.743

they did not swear me.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.744

<font> Q. <$$font> What opinion did you give?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.745

<font> A. <$$font> They told me his hand was under his throat,
and the marks might come from the fingers and thumb, and not sufficient
to occasion his death.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.746

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you give an opinion that he died a natural
death?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.747

<font> A. <$$font> At that time my opinion was, that as he lay
with his hand so <paren> <font> Witness shews how he lay <$$font>
<$$paren> his fingers might occasion the impression in his neck.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.753

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you think so?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.754

<font> A. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say I thought much
about it.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,28.755

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you think so then?

you have changed your opinion?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.762

<font> A. <$$font> I find I was out in my opinion.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.763

I thought so that evening.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.764

I thought I was too slender in my opinion.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.765

I thought I had been deficient in my judgment upon the report.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.766

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you think it was the act of another person?

what appearance would the neck and face have?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.775

<font> A. <$$font> In apoplexies they have froth in the mouth.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.776

<font> Q. <$$font> Is the face ever black and swelled?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.777

<font> A. <$$font> A little livid colour.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.778

<font> Q. <$$font> Would not it be black?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.779

<font> A. <$$font> No.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.780

<font> Q. <$$font> Is there any sudden death, natural

BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.781

<font> A. <$$font> No.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.782

<font> Q. <$$font> Is there any kind of natural death that would
occasion the neck to appear black?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.783

<font> A. <$$font> No.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.784

<font> Q. <$$font> Suppose a vein broke in the neck,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.785

would it make the face and throat black?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,29.786

<P_30>

<font> A. <$$font> No.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.788

<font> Q. <$$font> Did you ever know an instance?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.789

<font> A. <$$font> No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} think it.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.790

<font> Q. <$$font> Is it in the power of any man who catches
another, a strong man in his sleep, by the throat, to hold him long

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, the fingers were on the left side.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.792

I am not clear as to that.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.793

<font> Q. <$$font> Are you clear that the marks of the fingers
were distinct?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.794

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.795

<font> Q. <$$font> Were the marks of the fingers black?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.796

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,30.797

<font> Q. <$$font> What colour was the other swelling between

<font> Q. <$$font> You examined the body?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.821

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, his face and trunk too look'd black.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.822

<font> Q. <$$font> Did the trunk look remarkably black?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.823

<font> A. <$$font> I think it was preternatural,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.824

<font> Q. <$$font> What other appearance?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.826

<font> A. <$$font> Very distinct marks of a thumb and four fingers.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.827

I think the left.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.828

<font> Q. <$$font> From the marks?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.829

<font> A. <$$font> Yes.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.830

<font> Q. <$$font> How?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.831

<font> A. <$$font> From the left hand.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.832

<font> Q. <$$font> How was $the {TEXT:last_letter_of_"the"_missing}
flesh between?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.833

<font> A. <$$font> Not so deep $coloured
{TEXT:first_three_letters_of_"coloured"_missing}.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.834

<font> Q. <$$font> Were they sufficient to occasion a man's death?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.835

<font> A. <$$font> Yes, by the continuation of the gripe.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.836

<font> Q. <$$font> Upon view of the body, what is your opinion,
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.837

did that person die a natural death, attended with such marks upon the
throat, BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.838

or did he die a violent death?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.839

<font> A. <$$font> It is very difficult to answer that;
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.840

I should be very diffident in answering that.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.841

<font> Q. <$$font> Considering that the marks were not marks of
a natural death?  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.842

<font> A. <$$font> No, certainly they were not.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.843

That pressure would occasion a person's death in a very few minutes.
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.844

<font> Q. <$$font> What is your opinion now?
BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.845

<font> A. <$$font> I am afraid those marks were of a sufficient
violence to occasion the man's death.  BEDDINGFIELD-1763-2,31.846
