<P_11>

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 15.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.2

We were inform'd of the Invasion intended by the <font> French, <$$font>
who were expected to land every Hour.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.3

I therefore exhorted the Congregation, in the Words of our Lord, <paren>
Luke xxi. 36. <$$paren> <font> Watch ye WESLEY-174X-1,11.4

and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these
Things, and to stand before the Son of Man.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,11.5

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 16.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.6

In the Evening, after expounding the third Chapter of <font> Jonah,
<$$font> I besought every one to <font> turn from <$$font> his <font>
Evil Way, and cry mightily to <$$font> God: WESLEY-174X-1,11.7

and inlarged on these Words, <font> Who can tell if <$$font> God <font>
will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger that we
perish not?  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,11.8

We observ'd <font> Frid. <$$font> 17. as a Day of solemn
Fasting and Prayer.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.9

In the Afternoon, many being met together, I exhorted them, now, while
they had Opportunity, to make to themselves, Friends of the Mammon of
Unrighteousness: to deal their Bread to the Hungry, to clothe the Naked ,
and not to hide themselves from their own Flesh.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.10

And God open'd their Hearts, so that they contributed near Fifty Pounds ,
which I began laying out the very next Hour, in Linen, Woollen and Shoes,
for them whom I knew to be diligent, and yet in Want.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.11

In the Evening I expounded <font> Daniel <$$font> 3; and those Words
in particular: <font> The <$$font> God <font> whom we serve is able to
deliver us from the burning fiery Furnace.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.12

But if not, we will not serve thy Gods, nor worship the Golden Image
which thou hast set up.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,11.13

<font> Sat. <$$font> 18.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.14

I received an Account from <font> James Jones, <$$font> of another Kind
of Invasion in <font> Staffordshire.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,11.15

The Substance of it was as follows.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.16

"On <font> Monday, January <$$font> 23, a great Mob gathered together,
at <font> Darlaston, <$$font> a Mile from <font> Wednesbury.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,11.17

They fell upon a few People who were going to <font> Wednesbury, <$$font>
and among the rest, on <font> Joshua Constable's <$$font> Wife of <font>
Darlaston.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,11.18

Some of them threw her down, WESLEY-174X-1,11.19

and five or six held her down, that another might force her.
WESLEY-174X-1,11.20

But she continued to resist, till they changed their Purpose, beat her
much, and went away.  WESLEY-174X-1,11.21

<P_12>

<font> Mond. Jan. <$$font> 30.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.23

The Mob gathered again, WESLEY-174X-1,12.24

broke into <font> Joshua Constable's <$$font> House, WESLEY-174X-1,12.25

pull'd Part of it down, WESLEY-174X-1,12.26

broke some of his Goods in Pieces, WESLEY-174X-1,12.27

and carried the rest away: particularly, all his Shop Goods, to a
considerable Value.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.28

But not satisfied with this, they sought for him and his Wife, swearing ,
they would knock their Brains out.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.29

Their little Children mean-time, as well as themselves, wandered up and
down, no one daring to relieve or take them in, least they should hazard
their own Lives.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.30

<font> Tues. <$$font> 31.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.31

About a Hundred of the Mob met together, on the Church-Hill at <font>
Wednesbury.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,12.32

But hearing some of <font> Wednesbury <$$font> were resolved to defend
themselves, they dispersed for that Time.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.33

<font> Wedn. Feb. <$$font> 1.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.34

Mr <font> Charles Wesley <$$font> came to <font> Birmingham, <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,12.35

and the next Day preached at <font> Wednesbury.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,12.36

the whole Congregation was quiet and attentive, WESLEY-174X-1,12.37

nor had we any Noise or Interruption.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.38

<font> Mond. <$$font> 6.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.39

I accompanied him Part of his Way, WESLEY-174X-1,12.40

and in the Afternoon came back to <font> Wednesbury.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,12.41

I found the Society met together, and commending themselves to God in
Prayer, having been inform'd, That many both at <font> Darlaston <$$font>
and other Places, had bound themselves by an Oath, To come on <font>
Shrove-Tuesday, <$$font> <paren> the next Day <$$paren> and plunder
all the <font> Methodists <$$font> in <font> Wednesbury.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,12.42

We continued in Prayer till the Evening.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.43

I desired as many as could, to meet me $again {TEXT:agaiu} at Eight in
the Morning.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.44

But I had scarce begun to speak, when one came running with all Speed,
WESLEY-174X-1,12.45

and told us, a large Mob was coming into the Town, and had broke into
some Houses already.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.46

I immediately retired to my Father's House: WESLEY-174X-1,12.47

but he did not dare to receive me.  WESLEY-174X-1,12.48

Nor did any one else; till at length <font> Henry Parks <$$font> took me
in; whence early in the Morning I went to <font> Birmingham.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,12.49

The Mob had been gathering all <font> Monday <$$font> Night,
WESLEY-174X-1,12.50

and on <font> Tuesday <$$font> Morning they began their Work.
WESLEY-174X-1,12.51

They assaulted, one after another, all the Houses of those who were
called <font> Methodists.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,12.52

They first <P_13> broke all their Windows, suffering neither Glass,
Lead, nor Frames to remain therein.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.53

Then they made their Way in: WESLEY-174X-1,13.54

and all the Tables, Chairs, Chest of Drawers, with whatever was not
easily removable, they dashed in Pieces, particularly Shop-Goods, and
Furniture of every kind.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.55

What they could not well break, as Feather-beds, they cut in Pieces,
WESLEY-174X-1,13.56

and strew'd about the Room.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.57

<font> William Sitch <$$font>'s Wife was $Lying $in {TEXT:Lying-in}
: WESLEY-174X-1,13.58

but that was all one; WESLEY-174X-1,13.59

they pull'd away her Bed too, WESLEY-174X-1,13.60

and cut it in Pieces. "WESLEY-174X-1,13.61

<paren> Had the <font> French <$$font> come in their Place, would they
have done more?  <$$paren> WESLEY-174X-1,13.62

"All this Time none offered to resist them.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.63

Indeed most Part, both Men and Women, fled for their Lives.
WESLEY-174X-1,13.64

Only the Children stayed, not knowing whither to go.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.65

Wearing Apparel, and Things which were of Value, or easily saleable,
they carried away; every Man loading himself with as much as he could
well carry, of whatever he liked best.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.66

Some of the Gentlemen who had set the Mob to work, or threaten'd to turn
away Collier or Miner out of their Service, that did not come and do his
Part, now drew up a Paper, for those of the Society to sign, importing,
That they would never invite or receive any <font> Methodist <$$font>
Preacher more.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.67

On this Condition, they told them they would stop the Mob at once;
WESLEY-174X-1,13.68

otherwise they must take what followed.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.69

This they offer'd to several: WESLEY-174X-1,13.70

but they declar'd, one and all, We have already lost all our Goods:
WESLEY-174X-1,13.71

and nothing more can follow, but the Loss of our Lives, which we
<font> will <$$font> lose too, rather than wrong our Consciences.
WESLEY-174X-1,13.72

On <font> Wednesday <$$font> the Mob divided into two or three Companies
, one of which went to <font> Aldridge, <$$font> four Miles from <font>
Wednesbury, <$$font> and plundered many Houses there, as they had done
in several other Villages.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.73

Here also they loaded themselves with Cloaths and Goods of all Sorts, as
much as they could $stand $under {TEXT:standunder}.  WESLEY-174X-1,13.74

They came back through <font> Walsal <$$font> <P_14> with their Spoils.
WESLEY-174X-1,14.75

But the Gentlemen of <font> Walsal <$$font> being apprised of their
coming, raised a Body of Men, who met them, took what they had away,
and laid it up in the Town-hall.  WESLEY-174X-1,14.76

Notice was then sent to <font> Aldridge, <$$font> that every Man who had
been plundered, might come and take his own Goods.  WESLEY-174X-1,14.77

Mr. <font> Wood of Wednesbury <$$font> likewise told several.
WESLEY-174X-1,14.78

They should have what could be found of their Goods, on Condition
they would promise, Not to receive or hear those Preachers any more.
WESLEY-174X-1,14.79

On <font> Friday <$$font> in the Afternoon I went $from {TEXT:form}
<font> Birmingham, <$$font> designing to go to <font> Tipton-Green.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,14.80

But finding the Mob were still raging up and down, I returned to <font>
Birmingham, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,14.81

and soon after <paren> having as yet no more Place in these Parts
<$$paren> set out for <font> London.  <$$font>"WESLEY-174X-1,14.82

Any who desires to see a fuller and more particular Account of
these surprizing Transactions, may read a small Tract, intitled,
"Modern Christianity exemplified at <font> Wednesbury.  <$$font>
"WESLEY-174X-1,14.83

Before I leave this Subject, it may be proper to insert an
Advertisement, which was not long after inserted in the publick Papers.
WESLEY-174X-1,14.84

In the <font> White-hall <$$font> and <font> London-Evening Post,
Saturday, February <$$font> 18, was a Paragraph with some Mistakes,
which it may not be amiss to rectify.  WESLEY-174X-1,14.85

"By a private Letter from <font> Staffordshire, <$$font> we have Advice
of an Insurrection <font> of <$$font> the People called Methodists.
"WESLEY-174X-1,14.86

The Insurrection was not <font> of <$$font> the People called Methodists,
but <font> against <$$font> them: WESLEY-174X-1,14.87

"Who upon some <font> pretended <$$font> Insults from the Church Party,
"- WESLEY-174X-1,14.88

They <font> pretended <$$font> no Insults from the Church Party; being
themselves no other than <font> true <$$font> Members of the Church of
<font> England <$$font>; WESLEY-174X-1,14.89

but were <font> more <$$font> insulted by a mixt Multitude of Churchgoers
<paren> who seldom, if ever, go near a Church <$$paren> Dissenters and
Papists: WESLEY-174X-1,14.90

-"have assembled themselves in a riotous Manner"- WESLEY-174X-1,14.91

Here is another small Error Personae.  WESLEY-174X-1,14.92

Many Hundreds of the Mob did assemble themselves in <P_15> a riotous
Manner, having given publick Notice several Days before <paren>
particularly by a Paper set up in <font> Walsal <$$font> Market-Place
<$$paren> That on <font> Shrove-Tuesday <$$font> they intended to come
and <font> destroy the Methodists, <$$font> and inviting all the Country
to come and join them.  WESLEY-174X-1,15.93

"And having committed several Outrages - WESLEY-174X-1,15.94

without ever committing any, WESLEY-174X-1,15.95

they have suffered all Manner of Outrages for several Months past:
WESLEY-174X-1,15.96

They proceeded at last to burn the House of one of their Adversaries.
"WESLEY-174X-1,15.97

- Without burning any House, or making any Resistance, some Hundreds
of them, on <font> Shrove-Tuesday <$$font> last, had their own Houses
broken up, with Windows, Window-cases, Beds, Tools, Goods of all Sorts,
broke all to Pieces, or taken away by open Violence; their live Goods
driven off, themselves forced to fly for their Lives, and most of them
stript of all they had in the World.  WESLEY-174X-1,15.98

"Ever since the 20th of last <font> June <$$font> the Mob of <font>
Walsal, Darlaston, <$$font> and <font> Wednesbury, <$$font> hired for that
Purpose by their Betters, have broke open their poor Neighbour's Houses
at their Pleasure, by Night and by Day, extorted Money from the few that
had it, took away or destroyed their Victuals and Goods, beat and wounded
their Bodies, threatened their Lives, abused their Women <paren> some in
a Manner too horrible to Name <$$paren> and openly declar'd, they would
destroy every Methodist in the country: The <font> Christian <$$font>
country where his Majesty's innocent and loyal Subjects have been so
treated for Eight Months, and are now, by their wanton Persecutors,
publickly branded for Rioters and Incendiaries!  WESLEY-174X-1,15.99

'<font> Sund. <$$font> 19.  WESLEY-174X-1,15.100

Mr. <font> Viney <$$font> came to me from <font> Yorkshire,
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,15.101

and told me,"About a year ago, being then <font> Vor-steher <$$font>
<paren> a kind of President <$$paren> in the Church of <font> the Brethren
, <$$font> I proposed some Scruples I had concerning our Discipline
, with the Reasons on which they were grounded to Mr. <font>
Spangenberg, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,15.102

and beg'd, that till these were remov'd, I might have Liberty to
remain, <P_16> not a Governor, but a private Member of the Church.
"'WESLEY-174X-1,16.103

To this Mr. <font> Spangenberg <$$font> would not comply.
WESLEY-174X-1,16.104

So at his Instant, I continued in my Office, WESLEY-174X-1,16.105

and the thing slept till <font> May <$$font> 1743, when in a Meeting of
the <font> Labourers <$$font> <paren> so they term their Church-Officers
<$$paren> I was ordered to withdraw, WESLEY-174X-1,16.106

and the following Questions were proposed, 1, Whether <font> Richard
Viney <$$font> were not of Satan, and an Enemy to the Church?  And 2.
Whether his Objections to the Discipline of the Brethren, did not spring
from Anger, and Self, and Pride?  WESLEY-174X-1,16.107

After a Debate of four Hours, I was call'd in and ask'd,"If I was
convinced those Objections were wrong?  WESLEY-174X-1,16.108

I said, I was not, WESLEY-174X-1,16.109

I desir'd they would cast Lots; which after a little Debate, they did.
WESLEY-174X-1,16.110

The Lot came,"the Objections are just. "WESLEY-174X-1,16.111

So for a Time the Thing slept again.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.112

"But in <font> November <$$font> following, they considered the Point
again: WESLEY-174X-1,16.113

the Result was, That they sent one to tell me,"I was of Satan; had raised
Objections against the <font> Brethren <$$font> from Anger, and Self,
and Pride, and therefore I was cut off from the Church, and deliver'd
over to Satan. "WESLEY-174X-1,16.114

I was greatly surprized, but not disturb'd.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.115

God gave me perfect Peace.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.116

After much Prayer, I wrote to you, to know where I might meet you.
WESLEY-174X-1,16.117

I know it was the Will of God I should come, and that I should give
myself up to your Direction; WESLEY-174X-1,16.118

and therefore I have spoke without any Disguise or Reserve. "
WESLEY-174X-1,16.119

I told him,"If you go back, you are welcome to go, WESLEY-174X-1,16.120

if you stay with me, you are welcome to stay.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.121

Only whatever you do, do it with a clear Conscience, and I shall be
satisfied either way. "WESLEY-174X-1,16.122

After a few Days, he went back to <font> Yorkshire <$$font> to talk with
his Wife.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.123

<font> The Brethren <$$font> saw him again, WESLEY-174X-1,16.124

and I saw him no more.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.125

<font> Sat. <$$font> 25.  WESLEY-174X-1,16.126

In returning at Night from <font> Snow's-fields, <$$font> at the Corner
of <font> Joyner-Street, <$$font> the Coach, wherein five of us were,
was overturn'd, but without any one's being hurt: although the Shock
was so <P_17> great as not only to dash the Fore-windows in Pieces,
but to break the Axle-tree in two.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.127

<font> Mond. <$$font> 27.  Was the Day I had appointed to go out
of Town.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.128

But understanding a Proclamation was just publish'd, requiring <font>
all Papists <$$font> to go out of <font> London, <$$font> before the
<font> Friday <$$font> following, I was determined to stay another Week,
that I might cut off all Occasion of Reproach.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.129

I was the more willing to stay, that I might procure more Rayment for
the Poor, before I left <font> London.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,17.130

For this Purpose I made a second Collection, which amounted to about
Thirty Pounds.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.131

But perceiving, That the whole Money received, would not answer one
third of the Expence, I determin'd to go round the Classes, and beg for
the rest, till I had gone thro'the whole Society.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.132

<font> Fri. March <$$font> 2.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.133

I began to put this in Execution.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.134

While I was at an House in <font> Spittlefields, <$$font> a Justice of
Peace came, with the Parish-Officers, being on their Search for Papists.
WESLEY-174X-1,17.135

I was glad of the Opportunity to talk with them at large, both of our
Principles and Practice.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.136

When I went out, a pretty large Mob attended me to the Door of the House
to which I was going.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.137

But they did us no hurt, WESLEY-174X-1,17.138

only gaped, and stared, WESLEY-174X-1,17.139

and hallowed as loud as they could.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.140

<font> Mond. <$$font> 5.  WESLEY-174X-1,17.141

I was much prest to write an Address to the King, which I did in the
following Terms: WESLEY-174X-1,17.142

"To the King's Most Excellent Majesty: WESLEY-174X-1,17.143

The humble Address of the Societies in <font> England <$$font> and <font>
Wales, <$$font> in Derision called <font> Methodists: <$$font> <font>
WESLEY-174X-1,17.144

"Most gracious Sovereign, <$$font> So inconsiderable as we are, <font>
a people scattered and peeled, and trodden under Foot from the Beginning
hitherto, <$$font> we should in no wise have presumed , even on this
Great Occasion, to open our Lips to your Majesty, had we not been
induced, indeed constrained <P_18> so to do, by two considerations:
The One, that in spite of all our Remonstrances on that head, we are
continually represented, as a peculiar Sect of Men, separating ourselves
from the established Church: The Other, that we are still traduced
as inclined to Popery, and consequently disaffected to your Majesty.
WESLEY-174X-1,18.145

Upon these considerations, we think it incumbent upon us, if we must
stand as a distinct Body from our Brethren, to tender for ourselves,
our most dutiful Regards to your Sacred Majesty: and to declare in the
Presence of Him we serve, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, That
we are a Part <paren> however mean <$$paren> of that Protestant Church,
established in these Kingdoms: That we unite together for this, and no
other End, to promote, so far as we may be capable, Justice, Mercy,
and Truth, the Glory of God, and Peace and Good-will among Men: That
we detest and abhor the Fundamental Doctrines of the Church of <font>
Rome, <$$font> and are steadily attached to your Majesty's Royal Person
and illustrious House.  WESLEY-174X-1,18.146

We $can $not {TEXT:cannot} indeed say or do either more or less, than we
apprehend consistent with the written Word of God.  WESLEY-174X-1,18.147

But we are ready to obey your Majesty to the uttermost, in all Things
which we conceive to be agreeable thereto.  WESLEY-174X-1,18.148

And we earnestly exhort all with whom we converse, as they fear God,
to honour the King.  WESLEY-174X-1,18.149

We of the Clergy in particular, put all Men in mind, to revere the higher
Powers as of God; WESLEY-174X-1,18.150

and continually declare, Ye must needs be subject, not only for Wrath,
but also for Conscience Sake.  WESLEY-174X-1,18.151

Silver and Gold <paren> most of us must own <$$paren> we have none.
WESLEY-174X-1,18.152

But such as we have, we humbly beg your Majesty to accept; together with
our Hearts and Prayers: WESLEY-174X-1,18.153

May He who hath bought us with his Blood, the Prince of all the Kings
of the Earth, fight against all the Enemies of your Majesty, with the
two-edged Sword that cometh out of his Mouth!  WESLEY-174X-1,18.154

And when he calleth your Majesty from this Throne, <P_19> full of Years
and Victories, may it be with that Voice, WESLEY-174X-1,19.155

Come, receive the Kingdom prepared for Thee, from the Beginning of
the World!  WESLEY-174X-1,19.156

These are the continual Prayers of your Majesty's Dutiful and Loyal
Subjects, JOHN WESLEY, etc. WESLEY-174X-1,19.157

But upon farther Consideration, it was judged best to lay it aside.
WESLEY-174X-1,19.158

<font> Sund. <$$font> 11.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.159

I found it was absolutely necessary for me, to spend a few Days at <font>
Bristol.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,19.160

In the Evening I set out.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.161

As I rode thro'<font> Newbury <$$font> the next Day, my Horse fell
WESLEY-174X-1,19.162

and threw me into a deep Mire.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.163

I was not hurt, WESLEY-174X-1,19.164

but after cleaning myself a little, went on, WESLEY-174X-1,19.165

and came to <font> Kingswood <$$font> between One and Two on <font>
Tuesday.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,19.166

I preached here with great Enlargement of Heart, as I did at <font>
Bristol <$$font> in the Evening.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.167

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 14.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.168

I endeavour'd to clear up the Misunderstandings, which had arisen,
by hearing the contending Parties Face to Face.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.169

It was as I suspected, a meer Strife of Words: of which they were all
so fully sensible, that I believe, they will not so easily again fall
into this Snare of the Devil.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.170

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 15.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.171

I talk'd largely with the <font> Kingswood <$$font> Stewards, concerning
the State of their Schools and Society; and then with the Master,
Mistress, and Children, WESLEY-174X-1,19.172

and found great Cause to bless God on their Behalf.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.173

In the Evening I preached at <font> Bristol, <$$font> on <font> I will
love thee, O Lord, my Strength; <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,19.174

commending myself to their Prayers, I rode to <font> Marshfield.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,19.175

<font> Sat. <$$font> 17.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.176

We reached <font> London.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.177

Sun. <$$font> 18, was a Day of rest.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.178

<font> Tues. <$$font> 20.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.179

Having receiv'd a Summons from the Justices of <font> Surry, <$$font>
to appear at their Court at St. <font> Margaret <$$font>'s Hill,
I did so, WESLEY-174X-1,19.180

and ask'd,"Has any one any thing to lay to my Charge? "
WESLEY-174X-1,19.181

None made any Reply.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.182

At length, one of the Justices said,"Sir, Are you willing to take the
Oaths to his Majesty?  and to sign the Declaration against Popery?
"WESLEY-174X-1,19.183

I said, I am; WESLEY-174X-1,19.184

which I accordingly did, and returned home.  WESLEY-174X-1,19.185

<P_20>

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 22.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.187

I gave the Society an Account, of what had been done with regard to
the Poor.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.188

By the Contributions and Collections, I had received about one hundred
and seventy Pounds; with which above three hundred and thirty Poor,
had been provided with needful Clothing.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.189

Thirty or Forty remaining still in Want, and there being some Debts for
the Cloaths already distributed, the next Day, being <font> Good-Friday
, <$$font> I made one Collection more of about six and twenty Pounds.
WESLEY-174X-1,20.190

This Treasure, at least, neither Rust nor Moth shall corrupt, nor Thieves
break thro'and steal.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.191

<font> Sat. <$$font> 24.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.192

My Brother and I agreed, it was enough for one of us to stay in Town,
while the other endeavour'd to strengthen our Brethren in other Parts.
WESLEY-174X-1,20.193

So on <font> Mond. <$$font> 26.  I set out with <font> James
Wheatley, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,20.194

and came in the Evening to <font> Newbury.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,20.195

While we were at Breakfast the next Day, two or three poor Men were with
many Oaths relating their Exploits the Day before.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.196

I turn'd, WESLEY-174X-1,20.197

and appeal'd to their own Hearts;"Whether they were doing well?
"WESLEY-174X-1,20.198

They own'd their Fault, WESLEY-174X-1,20.199

and were so loving we could scarce get away.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.200

We called at an House in the Afternoon, wherein the first Person we met,
was so drunk, that she could not speak plain, and could but just make
shift to curse and swear.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.201

In the next Room we found three or four more merry People, keeping <font>
Easter <$$font> in much the same Manner.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.202

But their Mirth was soon spoiled.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.203

They gave earnest heed to the Things they little regarded before,
WESLEY-174X-1,20.204

and knew not how to express their Thankfulness for our Advice, and for
a few little Books which we left with them, WESLEY-174X-1,20.205

In the Evening I preached at <font> Bristol.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,20.206

On <font> Wedn. <$$font> and <font> Thurs. <$$font>
I settled all Thing there, WESLEY-174X-1,20.207

and on <font> Frid. <$$font> 30. rode to <font>
Middlesey , <$$font> where I preached to a small, serious Congregation.
WESLEY-174X-1,20.208

<font> Sat. <$$font> 31.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.209

Calling at <font> Chard, <$$font> I light upon a poor Woman, unawares,
who was earnestly groaning for Redemption.  WESLEY-174X-1,20.210

At Noon we spent an Hour with a little Company in <font> Axminster,
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,20.211

and <P_21> hastened on for <font> Crockern-Wells.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,21.212

But the Hail and Snow falling fast, we could not reach it, till past
Nine o'Clock.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.213

<font> Sund. April <$$font> 1.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.214

I rode to <font> Sticklepath.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,21.215

At One I preached in an open Place, on <font> This is the Record, that
<$$font> God <font> hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in
his Son.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,21.216

A Storm of Rain and Hail began while I was preaching: WESLEY-174X-1,21.217

but the Congregation did not move.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.218

At Five I preached again.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.219

Many of the poor People followed me to the House at which I lodged:
WESLEY-174X-1,21.220

and we could not consent to part, till I had spent another Hour in
Exhortation, and Prayer, and Thanksgiving.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.221

I read To-day the strange Account of that <font> John Endicot, <$$font>
Governor of <font> New-England, <$$font> and his Associates there,
who beat and imprison'd so many of the poor Quakers, and murder'd
<font> William Robinson, Marmaduke Stephenson, <$$font> and Others.
WESLEY-174X-1,21.222

O who would have look'd for farther Inquisitors at <font> Boston!
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,21.223

Surely these Men did not cry out against <font> Popish <$$font> Cruelty!
WESLEY-174X-1,21.224

<font> Mond. <$$font> 2.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.225

I preached at Five, WESLEY-174X-1,21.226

and rode on toward <font> Launceston.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,21.227

The Hills were cover'd with Snow, as in the Depth of Winter.
WESLEY-174X-1,21.228

About Two we came to <font> Trewint, <$$font> wet and weary enough, having
been battered by the Rain and Hail for some Hours.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.229

I preached in the Evening to many more than the House would contain,
on the Happiness of him whose Sins are forgiven.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.230

In the Morning <font> Degory Isbel <$$font> undertook to pilot us
over the great Moor, all the Paths being cover'd with Snow, which in
many Places was driven together, too deep for Horse or Man to pass.
WESLEY-174X-1,21.231

The Hail followed us for the first seven Miles; WESLEY-174X-1,21.232

we had then a fair, tho'exceeding sharp Day.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.233

I preached at <font> Gwenap <$$font> in the Evening to a plain,
simple-hearted People; WESLEY-174X-1,21.234

and God comforted us by each other.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.235

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 3.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.236

About Eleven we reached St. <font> Ives, <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,21.237

I was a little surprized at entering <font> John Nance <$$font>'s House,
being received by many who were waiting for me there with a loud <paren>
tho'not bitter <$$paren> Cry.  WESLEY-174X-1,21.238

But they <P_22> soon recovered, WESLEY-174X-1,22.239

and we poured out our Souls together in Praises and Thanksgiving.
WESLEY-174X-1,22.240

As soon as we went out, we were saluted, as usual, with a Huzza, and a
few Stones or Pieces of Dirt.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.241

But in the Evening none opened his Mouth while I proclaim'd, <font>
I will love thee, O Lord, my Strength.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.242

- I will call upon the Lord which is worthy to be praised;
WESLEY-174X-1,22.243

so shall I be safe from my Enemies.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,22.244

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 5.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.245

I took a View of the Ruins of the House which the Mob had pulled down
a little before, for Joy that Admiral <font> Matthews <$$font> had beat
the <font> Spaniards.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,22.246

Such is the <font> Cornish <$$font> Method of Thanksgiving!
WESLEY-174X-1,22.247

I suppose, if Admiral <font> Lestock <$$font> had fought too, they
would have knock'd all the <font> Methodists <$$font> on the Head.
WESLEY-174X-1,22.248

Both this Morning and Evening the Congregation was as large as the House
could well contain.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.249

In the Society, God did indeed sit upon his People, as a Refiners Fire.
WESLEY-174X-1,22.250

He darted into all <paren> I believe, hardly one excepted <$$paren>
the melting Flame of Love: so that their Heads were as Water, and their
Eyes as Fountains of Tears.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.251

<font> Frid. <$$font> 6.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.252

I spoke with the Members of the Society severally, WESLEY-174X-1,22.253

and observed with great Satisfaction, that Persecution had driven
only three or four away, and exceedingly strengthened the rest.
WESLEY-174X-1,22.254

The Persecution here was owing in great Measure to the indefatigable
Labourers of Mr. <font> Hoblin, <$$font> and Mr. <font>
Simmons <$$font>: Gentlemen worthy to be had in everlasting Remembrance
for their unwearied Endeavours to destroy Heresy.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.255

<font> Fortunati ambo!  WESLEY-174X-1,22.256

Siquid mea pagina possit, <$$font> <font> Nulla dies unquam memorivos
eximetcevo.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,22.257

<font> Sat. <$$font> 7.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.258

I took down Part of the Account of the late Riot; which <paren> to shew
the deep Regard of the Actors herein for his Majesty <$$paren> was on
the self same Day on which his Majesty's Proclamation against Rioters
was read.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.259

Yet I see much Good has been brought out of it already; particularly,
the great Peace we now enjoy.  WESLEY-174X-1,22.260

<P_23>

About Eleven <font> John Nance <$$font> and I set out for <font> Morva;
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,23.262

Having both the Wind and Rain full in our Faces, we were thoroughly wet
before we came to <font> Rosemargay, <$$font> where some of our Brethren
met us.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.263

I found there had been a Shaking among them, occasioned by the
confident Assertions of some, That they had seen Mr. <font>
Wesley, <$$font> a Week or two ago, with the Pretender in <font> France;
<$$font> and Others, That he was in Prison at <font> London.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,23.264

Yet the main Body still stood firm together, WESLEY-174X-1,23.265

and were not removed from the Hope of Gospel.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.266

The Wind and Rain beat hard upon us again, as we walk'd from <font>
Morva <$$font> to <font> St. Just, <$$font> which also frighted
many from coming.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.267

However some Hundreds were there, to whom I declar'd,"if ye have nothing
to pay, God will frankly forgive you all. " WESLEY-174X-1,23.268

It is remarkable, That those of <font> St. Just, <$$font> were
the Chief of the whole Country, for Hurling, Fighting, Drinking, and
all Manner of Wickedness.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.269

But many of the Lions are become Lambs, WESLEY-174X-1,23.270

are continually praising God, and calling their old Companions in Sin,
to come and magnify the Lord together.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.271

<font> Sund. <$$font> 8.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.272

I preached here at Five and at Twelve, and in the Evening at <font> Morva.
WESLEY-174X-1,23.273

Mond. <$$font> 9.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.274

I preached at Noon on <font> Triggivary Downs, <$$font> about two Miles
from <font> Penzance, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,23.275

a great Congregation was deeply attentive while I described the Sect
which is <font> every where spoken against.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,23.276

At Four I preached near <font> Gulval, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,23.277

regulated the little Society WESLEY-174X-1,23.278

and returned to <font> St. Ives.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,23.279

<font> Tues. <$$font> 10.  WESLEY-174X-1,23.280

I was inquiring, how Dr. -, a Person of unquestioned Sense
and Learning, could speak Evil of <font> this Way, <$$font> after
he had seen such a Change in the most abandoned of his Parishioners?
WESLEY-174X-1,23.281

But I was satisfied, when <font> Jonathan Reeves <$$font> inform'd me,
"That on the Dr's. asking him, who had been the better for
this Preaching?  And his replying,"The Man before you <paren> <font>
John Daniel <$$font> <$$paren> for one, who never before <font> knew
any Work of <$$font> God <font> upon his Soul; <$$font>"the Dr.
answered;"Get along; you are a Parcel of mad, crazy-headed Fellows
;"and taking him by the Shoulder, fairly thrust him to the Door.  <P_24>
WESLEY-174X-1,24.282

See here, what it is, which the World accounts Madness!  The knowing
<font> a Work of <$$font> God <font> upon our Soul.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,24.283

In the Afternoon I walk'd over to <font> Zunnor, <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,24.284

and after Preaching, settled the infant Society.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.285

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 11.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.286

Being the Publick Fast, the Church at <font> St. Ives <$$font>
was well filled.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.287

After reading those strong Words, <font> If they have called the Master
of the House <$$font> Beelzebub, <font> how $much {TEXT:mmch} more
them of his Household.  <$$font> Mr. <font> H. <$$font>
fulfilled them, by vehemently declaiming against <font> the New Sect,
<$$font> as Enemies of the Church, Jacobites, Papists, and what not!
WESLEY-174X-1,24.288

After Church, we met, WESLEY-174X-1,24.289

and spent an Hour in Prayer, not forgetting the poor Sinner against his
own Soul.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.290

In the Evening I preached at <font> Gwenap.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,24.291

I stood on the Wall, in the calm, still Evening, with the setting Sun
behind me, and almost an innumerable Multitude before, behind, and on
either hand.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.292

Many likewise sat on the little Hills, at some Distance from the Bulk
of the Congregation.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.293

But they could all hear distinctly while I read, <font> The Disciple is
not above his Master, <$$font> and the rest of those comfortable Words,
which are Day by Day fulfilled in our Ears.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.294

<font> Thur. <$$font> 12.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.295

About Eleven I preached at <font> Crovan.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,24.296

In the Afternoon we hear'd of the Success of Mr. <font> H.
<$$font>'s Sermon.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.297

<font> James Wheatly <$$font> was walking through the Town in the Evening
, when the Mob gathered, and began to throw Stones from all Quarters.
WESLEY-174X-1,24.298

He stepped into a House.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.299

but the Master of it followed him, like a Lion, to drag him out.
WESLEY-174X-1,24.300

Yet after a few Words, his Mind was changed, WESLEY-174X-1,24.301

and he swore, nobody should hurt him.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.302

Meantime one went for a Justice of Peace, who came, and promised to see
him safe home.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.303

The Mob followed, hollowing and shouting amain.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.304

Near <font> John Painter <$$font>'s House the Justice left him:
WESLEY-174X-1,24.305

they quickly beset the House.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.306

But a Messenger came from the Mayor, forbidding any to touch Mr.
<font> Wheatley, <$$font> at his Peril.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.307

He then went home.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.308

But between Seven and Eight the Mob came WESLEY-174X-1,24.309

and beset <font> John Nance <$$font>'s House.  WESLEY-174X-1,24.310

<font> John Nance <$$font> and <P_25> <font> John Paynter <$$font>
went out WESLEY-174X-1,25.311

and stood before the Door, though they were quickly covered with Dirt.
WESLEY-174X-1,25.312

The Cry was"Bring out the Preacher; WESLEY-174X-1,25.313

pull down the House:"WESLEY-174X-1,25.314

And they began to pull down the Boards which were nailed against the
Windows.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.315

But the Mayor, hearing it, came without delay, WESLEY-174X-1,25.316

and read the Proclamation against Riots: Upon which, after many Oaths
and Imprecations, they thought proper to disperse.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.317

About Six I reached <font> Morva, <$$font> wet through and through, the
Rain having continued with scarce any Intermission.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.318

However a little Company were gathered together, to whom I preached on,
<font> Ask, and it shall be given you.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,25.319

The next Day I had Time to dry my Cloaths at Mr. <font> John
<$$font>'s near <font> Penzance.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,25.320

At Noon I preached on the Downs, not far from his House.  About Three
at <font> Gulval, <$$font> and at <font> St. Ives <$$font> in
the Evening.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.321

<font> Sat. <$$font> 14.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.322

I took my leave of <font> St. Ives; <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,25.323

preached at two in <font> Cambourn, <$$font> and at <font> Gwenap <$$font>
in the Evening.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.324

<font> Sund. <$$font> 15.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.325

I preached here again at Five, and at Eight in <font> Stithian <$$font>
Parish.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.326

The Place was a green, triangular Plat, capable of holding eight or ten
thousand Men.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.327

I stood on one of the Walls that inclosed it.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.328

Many sat on the other two.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.329

Some Thousands stood between WESLEY-174X-1,25.330

and received the Word with all Readiness of Mind.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.331

At Five I preached at <font> Gwenap, <$$font> on a little Hill, near
the usual Place.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.332

It rained from the Time I began till I concluded.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.333

I felt no Pain while I spoke, WESLEY-174X-1,25.334

but the Instant I had done, and all the Time I was with the Society,
my Teeth and Head aked so violently, that I had hardly any Senses.
WESLEY-174X-1,25.335

I lay down as soon as I could, WESLEY-174X-1,25.336

and fell asleep.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.337

In the Morning <paren> blessed be God <$$paren> I ail'd nothing.
WESLEY-174X-1,25.338

<font> Mond. <$$font> 16.  WESLEY-174X-1,25.339

In the Afternoon we came again to <font> Trewint.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,25.340

Here I learned.  That Notice had been given of my preaching that
Evening in <font> Laneast <$$font> Church which was crouded exceedingly.
WESLEY-174X-1,25.341

Mr. <font> Bennet, <$$font> the Minister of <font> Laneast,
<$$font> carried me afterwards to his House, WESLEY-174X-1,25.342

and <paren> tho'above seventy Years old <$$paren> came with <P_26>
me in the Morning to <font> Trewint, <$$font> where I had promised to
preach at Five.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.343

Before we parted, <font> Degory Isbel <$$font> informed me, of an
Accusation against me, current in those Parts.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.344

It was really one which I did not expect: no more than that other,
vehemently asserted at <font> St. Ives, <$$font> of my bringing
the Pretender with me thither last Autumn, under the Name of <font>
John Downes, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,26.345

It was, That"I called myself <font> John Wesley, <$$font> whereas
every body knew Mr. <font> Wesley <$$font> was dead.
"WESLEY-174X-1,26.346

In the Afternoon we came to <font> Sticklepath; <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,26.347

I preached at Five.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.348

In the Evening the House was crouded as before.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.349

After a short Exhortation, and an Hour spent in Prayer, I commended them
to the Grace of God.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.350

<font> Wednes. <$$font> 18.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.351

Before Eight we reached <font> Crediton <$$font> <paren> or <font> Kirton
, <$$font> <$$paren> or rather the Ruins of it.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.352

For the Houses on both Sides were all in Ashes, for several hundred Yards.
WESLEY-174X-1,26.353

Lighting on a serious Woman I ask'd,"Are the People of this Place now
warn'd to seek God? "WESLEY-174X-1,26.354

She answered, Although some of them perished in the Flames, the rest
are just as they were before, cursing, swearing, drinking, playing,
and making merry, without God in all their Thoughts. "WESLEY-174X-1,26.355

She added,"No longer ago than <font> Thursday <$$font> last, the Men who
were rebuilding one of the Houses, were bitterly cursing and swearing
one at another, and two of them above the rest, when an Arch they were
under fell, and crushed those Two, with all their Bones in Pieces.
"WESLEY-174X-1,26.356

Will ye not at length hear the Rod, and Him that hath appointed it?
WESLEY-174X-1,26.357

Between Five and Six in the Evening we reached <font> Minehead.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,26.358

Finding a general Expectation of it among the People, about Seven I
preached near the Sea-shore, to almost all the Inhabitants of the Place.
WESLEY-174X-1,26.359

Most of the Gentlemen of the Town were there, WESLEY-174X-1,26.360

and behaved with Seriousness and Decency.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.361

<font> Thur. <$$font> 19.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.362

Having a Sloop ready, which came on purpose, we ran over the Channel in
about four Hours.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.363

Some of our Friends were waiting for us on the Shore.
WESLEY-174X-1,26.364

About one we came to <font> Fonmon <$$font> Castle.  WESLEY-174X-1,26.365

<P_27>

I found a natural Wish,"O for Ease and a Resting-Place. "
WESLEY-174X-1,27.367

Not yet.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.368

But Eternity is at hand!  WESLEY-174X-1,27.369

I preached at Six, and at Five in the Morning.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,27.370

Frid. <$$font> 20.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.371

About Ten we set out for <font> Cardiff: <$$font> where in the Evening
I preached in the Castle-Yard.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.372

All were serious and attentive, {COM:sic} WESLEY-174X-1,27.373

<font> Sat. <$$font> 21.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.374

I rode to <font> Garth <$$font> in <font> Brecknoc'shire <$$font>,
WESLEY-174X-1,27.375

and on <font> Sund. <$$font> 22. preached in the Church
there, both Morning and Afternoon.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.376

On <font> Mond. <$$font> 23. I preached in <font> Maesmennys
<$$font> Church, and afterwards in the Churchyard at <font> Builth.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,27.377

I observed only one Man with his Hat on: probably thro'Inattention;
WESLEY-174X-1,27.378

for he likewise kneeled down on the Grass with the rest, as soon as I
began to pray.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.379

<font> Tues. <$$font> 24.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.380

I preached at <font> Maesmennys <$$font> again, and about Five in
<font> Landdu <$$font> Church, near <font> Brecknock.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,27.381

Such a Church I never saw before.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.382

There was not a Glass-Window belonging to it; but only Boards, with
Holes bored here and there, through which a dim Light glimmered in.
WESLEY-174X-1,27.383

Yet even here may the Light of God's Countenance shine.
WESLEY-174X-1,27.384

And it has shone on many Hearts.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.385

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 25.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.386

We rode over the still snowy Mountains.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.387

At Twelve I preached at <font> Killigaer: <$$font> in the Evening
at <font> Caraiff, <$$font> and the next Evening at <font> Fonmon.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,27.388

On <font> Sat. <$$font> 28. I returned to <font> Bristol.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,27.389

After resting here, for eight Days <paren> though not unemployed <$$paren>
on <font> Mond. May <$$font> 7. I set out for the North.
WESLEY-174X-1,27.390

I preached about Eight at <font> Acton: <$$font> in the Afternoon at
<font> Stroud: <$$font> in the Evening at <font> Painswick, <$$font>
and at Five the next Morning.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.391

About Eight, <font> Tues. <$$font> 8.  I called at <font>
Glocester, <$$font> designing only to speak with a Friend:
WESLEY-174X-1,27.392

but finding an House full of People, I would not disappoint their
Expectation, WESLEY-174X-1,27.393

but stayed WESLEY-174X-1,27.394

and preached on The Form and the Power of Godliness.  WESLEY-174X-1,27.395

This made me somewhat later than I intended at <font> Cheltenham, <$$font>
where I preached on <font> By grace ye are saved thro'Faith, <$$font>
to a Company who seemed to understand just as much of the Matter ,
as if I had been talking <font> Greek.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,27.396

I found a People of quite another <P_28> kind at <font> Gutherton,
<$$font> to whom I preached on <font> Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,28.397

And many called upon God for Grace so to do, even with strong Cries
and Tears.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.398

We had a remarkable Blessing again at Five in the Morning, <font>
Wedn. <$$font> 9.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.399

About Noon I preached at <font> Stanley, <$$font> <paren> a Mile from
<font> Gutherton <$$font> <$$paren> at Three in <font> Tewkesbury,
<$$font> and in the Evening at the Abby in <font> Eversham.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,28.400

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 10.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.401

Riding by <font> Birmingham, <$$font> I called at a Village three Miles
beyond it.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.402

Here a poor Man was cursing and swearing at so uncommon a rate, that I
was constrained to speak to him very plainly.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.403

He received it, drunk as he was, in great Love, WESLEY-174X-1,28.404

and so did all his Companions.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.405

<font> Frid. <$$font> 11.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.406

I preached at <font> Sheffield: <$$font> On <font> Sat.
<$$font> 12. about Ten, at <font> Barley-hall.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,28.407

In the Afternoon I rode to <font> Epworth, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,28.408

and immediately went to Mr. <font> Maw <$$font>'s, to return
him Thanks for his good Offices to Mr. <font> Downes, <$$font>
and his honest and open Testimony for the Truth, before the Worshipful
Bench at <font> Kirton.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,28.409

It was not his Fault, that those <font> Honorable Men, <$$font> regarded
not the Laws either of God, or the King.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.410

But a Soldier they were resolved he should be, right or wrong -" Because
he was a Preacher. "WESLEY-174X-1,28.411

So to make all sure, they sent him away, a Prisoner to <font> Lincoln
<$$font> Goal!  WESLEY-174X-1,28.412

My first Design was, to have gone the shortest Way from <font> Sheffield
<$$font> to <font> Newcastle.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,28.413

But it was well I did not, considering the inexpressible Panick, which
had spread itself in all Places.  So that I came just in Time to remind
all the poor frighted Sheep, That <font> even the Hairs of <$$font>
our <font> Head are all number'd.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,28.414

I preached thrice at <font> Epworth <$$font> on <font> Sunday; <$$font>
and on <font> Mond. <$$font> 14. at <font> Terry.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,28.415

The Constable which took Mr. <font> Downes <$$font> for a Soldier,
with one of the Church Wardens were of my Audience.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.416

I was inform'd, they had threatned great Things before I came.
WESLEY-174X-1,28.417

But their Threatnings vanished into Air.  WESLEY-174X-1,28.418

<P_29>

At Two many of our Brethren at <font> Epworth <$$font> met, whom I
chearfully commended to the Grace of God.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.420

We were riding gently toward <font> Fishlake, <$$font> when two or three
Persons met us, and begg'd"we would not go that Way; WESLEY-174X-1,29.421

for the Town, they said, was all up in Arms, and abundance were waiting
for us in the Way, many of whom had made themselves very Drunk, and so
were ripe for any manner of Mischief. "WESLEY-174X-1,29.422

We accordingly rode to <font> Sykehouse <$$font> another Way.
WESLEY-174X-1,29.423

Some came in all hast hither also, to tell us,"All the Men in the
Congregation would be prest. "WESLEY-174X-1,29.424

Others affirmed,"The Mob was just a coming, and that they would certainly
fire the House, or pull it down to the Ground.  "WESLEY-174X-1,29.425

I told them,"Then our only way was, to make the best Use of it while it
was standing. "WESLEY-174X-1,29.426

So I began expounding the Tenth Chapter of St. <font> Matthew.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,29.427

But no Man opened his Lips against us.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.428

<font> Tues. <$$font> 15.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.429

After comforting the little Flock at <font> Norton, <$$font> I rode the
shortest Way to <font> Birstal.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,29.430

Here I found our Brethren partly mourning, and partly rejoicing, on
Account of <font> John Nelson.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,29.431

On <font> Friday, <$$font> the 4th Instant <paren> they informed me
<$$paren> the Constables took him just as he had ended his Sermon at
<font> Artherton, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,29.432

and the next Day carried him before the Commissioners at <font> Halifax,
<$$font> the most active of whom was Mr. <font> Coleby, <$$font>
Vicar of <font> Birstal.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,29.433

Many were ready to testify, That he was in no respect such a Person as
the Act of Parliament specified.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.434

But they were not hear'd.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.435

He was a Preacher; WESLEY-174X-1,29.436

that was enough.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.437

So he was sent for a Soldier at once.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.438

At Seven I preached on the Hill, no Man interrupting me.
WESLEY-174X-1,29.439

Afterwards I inquired into the State of the Society, WESLEY-174X-1,29.440

and found great Cause to bless God, whose Grace, even in these trying
Times, was sufficient for them.  WESLEY-174X-1,29.441

<P_30>

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 16.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.443

I talk'd at large with Mr. <font> Viney.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,30.444

He said,"His first Perplexity arose, from reading and reflecting upon some
Writings, which the Count published in <font> Pensylvania: <$$font> and
that the more deeply he considered the whole Affair, the more thoroughly
he was convinced, 1.  That the Count was at least as much the Head of
Theirs, as the Pope of the <font> Roman <$$font> Church.  2.  That he
had cruelly and unjustly broke up the Congregation at <font> Pilger-ruh
<$$font> in <font> Holstein, <$$font> because <paren> in Obedience to the
King of <font> Denmark, <$$font> their lawful Prince <$$paren> they had
disclaimed his Superiority over them.  3.  That the Labourers among <font>
the Brethren, <$$font> were absolutely Arbitrary in their Government of
the People; and lastly , That they grosly abused <font> The Lot, <$$font>
in Support of their Arbitrary Power.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.445

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 17.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.446

I preached at Five on <font> Matthew <$$font> the Tenth: at Noon, <font>
Little Horton, <$$font> near <font> Bradford: <$$font> about Three in the
Afternoon at <font> Stickerlane, <$$font> and at <font> Birstal <$$font>
in the Evening.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.447

<font> Frid. <$$font> 18.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.448

I rode to <font> Leeds, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,30.449

and preached in great Peace.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.450

<font> Sat. <$$font> 19.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.451

I went on to Mr. <font> Clayton <$$font>'s at <font> Wensley;
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,30.452

and at <font> Sund. <$$font> 20. preached in <font>
Redmire <$$font> Church on Part of <font> John iii. <$$font>
the Gospel for the Day.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.453

In the Afternoon I preached at <font> Bolton <$$font> Chapel on <font>
We know that we are of <$$font> God.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.454

I was much pleased at the serious Behaviour of the Congregation, both
in the Morning and Afternoon: especially at <font> Redmire, <$$font>
where from a Village of about thirty Houses, we had more than fifty
Communicants.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.455

<font> Mond. <$$font> 21.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.456

I rode to <font> Newcastle <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,30.457

and passed a quiet Week.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.458

<font> Mond. <$$font> 28.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.459

I began visiting the Classes in the Town, and on <font> Sund.
June <$$font> 3, those in the Country, which I had never found so much
in earnest before.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.460

I trust, there is not only, not a disorderly Walker, but hardly a Trifler
left among them.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.461

<font> Frid. <$$font> 8.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.462

I preached at Night on <font> John xvii. 3.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,30.463

The House could not contain the Congregation: WESLEY-174X-1,30.464

and most of them stayed either within or without, till the End of the
Midnight Hymn.  WESLEY-174X-1,30.465

<P_31>

<font> Sund. <$$font> 10.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.467

I preached at <font> Biddick, <$$font> about Eight: at <font>
Tanfield, <$$font> as soon as Morning Prayer was over.  At <font>
Spen <$$font> about Three, and in <font> Newcastle <$$font> at Six.
WESLEY-174X-1,31.468

I concluded the Day, in praising God with the Society.
WESLEY-174X-1,31.469

<font> Mond. <$$font> 11.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.470

I left <font> Newcastle, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,31.471

and in the Afternoon met <font> John Nelson <$$font> at <font> Durham,
<$$font> with <font> Thomas Beard: <$$font> another quiet and peaceable
Man, who had lately been torn from his Trade and Wife and Children, and
sent away as a Soldier: that is, banished from all that was near and dear
to him, and constrained to dwell among Lions, for no other Crime either
committed or pretended, than that of calling Sinners to Repentance.
WESLEY-174X-1,31.472

But his Soul was in nothing terrified by his Adversaries.
WESLEY-174X-1,31.473

Yet the Body, after a while, sunk under its Burden.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.474

He was then lodged in the Hospital at <font> Newcastle, <$$font> where
he still praised God continually.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.475

His Fever increasing, he was let Blood.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.476

His Arm festered, mortified WESLEY-174X-1,31.477

and was cut off: two or three Days after which God signed his Discharge,
and called him up to his eternal Home.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.478

"Servant of God, well done!  WESLEY-174X-1,31.479

Well hast thou fought The better Fight; who single $hast {TEXT:host}
maintain'd Against revolted Multitudes the Cause Of God, in Word,
mightier than they in Arms. "WESLEY-174X-1,31.480

<font> Tues. <$$font> 12.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.481

In the Evening I came to <font> Knaresborough.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,31.482

About Nine o'Clock I was informed, That the House in which we were, was
beset on every Side, with Men, Women and Children, WESLEY-174X-1,31.483

and desired those within.  to set open the Doors, and let all come in
that would.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.484

When the House was full, I came down.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.485

The Noise presently ceased, WESLEY-174X-1,31.486

and I proclaimed, <font> Christ our Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification
and Redemption.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,31.487

Only one drunken Man gave a little Interruption; WESLEY-174X-1,31.488

but his Companions soon thrust him out of Doors.  WESLEY-174X-1,31.489

So let all Satan's Devices fall on his <P_32> own Head!
WESLEY-174X-1,32.490

I trust, this mob did not come together in vain.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.491

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 13.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.492

I rode to <font> Leeds, <$$font> and thence to <font> Birstal.
WESLEY-174X-1,32.493

Tues. <$$font> 14.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.494

I accompanied <font> John Bennet <$$font> into <font> Lancashire.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,32.495

I preached to a small Congregation at Eleven; in the Afternoon at <font>
Woodley <$$font> in <font> Cheshire; <$$font> and in the Evening at
<font> Chinley-End <$$font> in <font> Derbyshire, <$$font> on <font>
Repent ye and believe the Gospel.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,32.496

<font> Frid. <$$font> 15 I preached at <font> Chinley <$$font>
at Five: about Noon in <font> the Peak, <$$font> and in the Evening at
<font> Barley Hall.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.497

Sat <$$font> 16. in the Evening I preach'd at <font> Sykehouse
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,32.498

And by setting out early in the Morning, <font> Sund.
<$$font> 17. at Eight preached in <font> Epworth.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,32.499

I came thither in season.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.500

For two such Sermons as Mr. <font> Ramley <$$font> preached on this
Day, so exquisitely bitter, and totally false, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
say I ever heard before.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.501

After Evening Service I preached on <font> Rom. iii.
22. <$$font> to a much larger Congregation than in the Morning.
WESLEY-174X-1,32.502

And I believe all that were sincere of Heart, were exceedingly comforted.
WESLEY-174X-1,32.503

<font> Mond. <$$font> 18.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.504

I left <font> Epworth, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,32.505

and on <font> Wedn. <$$font> 20. in the Afternoon met my
Brother in <font> London.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,32.506

<font> Mond. <$$font> 25. and the five following Days
, we spent in Conference with many of our Brethren <paren> come from
several Parts <$$paren> who desire nothing but to save their own Souls,
and those that hear them.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.507

And surely as long as they continue thus minded, their Labour shall not
be in vain in the Lord.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.508

The next Week we endeavoured to purge the Society of all that did not
walk according to the Gospel.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.509

By this Means we reduced the Number of Members to less than Nineteen
Hundred.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.510

But Number is an inconsiderable Circumstance.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.511

May God increase them in Faith and Love!  WESLEY-174X-1,32.512

<font> Mond, July <$$font> 9.  WESLEY-174X-1,32.513

My Brother set out for <font> Cornwall.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,32.514

I had much Trouble for the fortnight following, in endeavouring to
prevent an unwary Man from destroying his own, and many other Souls,
WESLEY-174X-1,32.515

On <font> Mond. <$$font> 23. when I set out for <font>
Bristol, <$$font> I flattered myself, that the Work was done.
WESLEY-174X-1,32.516

But upon my Return, I found I had done just nothing: so that on <font>
Thursday, <P_33> August <$$font> 2. I was constrained to declare
in the Society, That <font> Thomas Williams <$$font> was no longer in
connection with us.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.517

<font> Fri. <$$font> 10.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.518

I preached to the Debtors in <font> Newgate, <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,33.519

and desired two or three of my Friends to attend them weekly.
WESLEY-174X-1,33.520

I had a serious, well-behaved Congregation.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.521

Perhaps God may give us some Fruit here also.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.522

<font> Tues. <$$font> 14.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.523

Mr. <font> Piers <$$font> rode over with me to <font> Shoreham,
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,33.524

and introduced me to Mr. <font> Perronet.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,33.525

I hope to have Cause of blessing God for ever, for the Acquaintance
begun this Day.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.526

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 15.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.527

I went to <font> Bedlam, <$$font> at the repeated Request of Mr.
<font> S. <$$font> who had been confined there above two Years.
WESLEY-174X-1,33.528

This was the Person who, while he was speaking against my Brother and
me to the Society at <font> Kingswood, <$$font> was in a Moment struck
raving Mad.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.529

But it seems, God is at length intreated for him, and has restored him
to a sound Mind.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.530

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 16.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.531

I received a remarkable Letter, Part of which is here subjoined:
WESLEY-174X-1,33.532

<font> Aug. <$$font> 14, 1744.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.533

<font> Rev. Sir, <$$font>"I Was surprized on <font> Sunday,
<$$font> when you was pleased to tell me, I carried things to Extremes,
in denying the lawful Pleasures in Eating, WESLEY-174X-1,33.534

I denied only Self-indulgence in Eating - WESLEY-174X-1,33.535

All which I advance is, That he who will be Christ's Disciple, must
absolutely deny himself.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.536

It was once a great Self-denial to me, Not to go to a Play, or to other
Diversions.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.537

But this is now no Self-denial to me at all.  So that if I was now called
to deny myself in these Things only, I might take up with what is past,
and now live an agreeable, self-indulgent Life.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.538

But God forbid.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.539

I plainly see every Hour produces Occasions of Self-pleasing.
WESLEY-174X-1,33.540

And this I apprehend is a sufficient Call for, and Rule of Self-denial.
WESLEY-174X-1,33.541

For Instance: in the Morning, it is a great Self-denial, to rise out of
a warm Bed.  WESLEY-174X-1,33.542

But if I do not, I am immediately <P_34> condemned as a slothful Servant.
WESLEY-174X-1,34.543

If I do, I find a great inward Blessing.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.544

Under the Preaching, it is Self-pleasing, to see who is here, who there.
WESLEY-174X-1,34.545

But if I do let my Eye wander, I become cold and lifeless:
WESLEY-174X-1,34.546

if I deny myself, I often find even a present Reward.
WESLEY-174X-1,34.547

In walking the Streets, I can please myself, by looking this way and that;
on this Chariot, that House and Picture.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.548

But if I deny myself, for Christ's Sake, his Consolations abound with me.
WESLEY-174X-1,34.549

But I may deny myself outwardly, and yet be Self-indulgent, namely by
allowing myself in vain and trifling Thoughts.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.550

Here is a continual Fight, and an {COM:sic} hard Struggle I must have
before I conquer.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.551

But when I do overcome, I lose nothing by it; WESLEY-174X-1,34.552

for my Soul is delighted with secret Refreshments.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.553

At Noon, I may find many pleasant Things.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.554

And of this it was, that I said to Mr. <font> Richards, <$$font>"If
there are two Dishes set before you, by the Rule of Self-denial, you
ought to eat of that which you like the least.  "WESLEY-174X-1,34.555

And this Rule I desire to observe myself: always to choose what is least
pleasing and cheapest.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.556

Therefore I feed much upon Milk, WESLEY-174X-1,34.557

It is pleasant enough, WESLEY-174X-1,34.558

and nothing I can find is so cheap.  Whereas if one Sort of Food be dearer
than another, and yet {COM:sic} I abuse it, because more agreeable to
my Appetite: this I apprehend is directly contrary to the Discipleship
of a self-denying Master.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.559

And this Kind of self-indulgence <paren> not in Food only <$$paren>
is practis'd by too many that know the Truth.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.560

I suppose, Sir, you now perceive, I do not condemn all pleasure in Eating.
WESLEY-174X-1,34.561

But I condemn all self-indulgence both in that and other things,
particularly in Talking.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.562

Many who think themselves Believers, please themselves with talking more
than is profitable, WESLEY-174X-1,34.563

they talk even of the Things of God, till they bring a Deadness, nay,
an unaccountable Carelessness over their Spirits.  WESLEY-174X-1,34.564

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} say, they laugh or talk idly.
WESLEY-174X-1,34.565

But still they are not deeply serious, WESLEY-174X-1,34.566

nor is their Conversation truly solid: whereas I should think the
Conscience of a true Believer, <P_35> is tender as the Apple of an Eye;
and that to such a one it would be less Pain to suffer the Rack, than
to trifle, either in Word or Deed. "WESLEY-174X-1,35.567

<font> Tues. <$$font> 21.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.568

I set out with a few Friends for <font> Oxford.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,35.569

On <font> Wednesday <$$font> my Brother met us from <font> Bristol.
WESLEY-174X-1,35.570

Frid. <$$font> 24.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.571

St. <font> Bartholomew <$$font>'s Day, I preached, I suppose,
the last Time at St. <font> Mary <$$font>'s.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.572

Be it so.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.573

I am now clear of the Blood of these Men.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.574

I have fully delivered my own Soul.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.575

The Beadle came to me afterwards, WESLEY-174X-1,35.576

and told me"The Vice-chancellor had sent him for my Notes. "
WESLEY-174X-1,35.577

I sent them without delay, not without admiring the wise Providence
of God.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.578

Perhaps few Men of Note would have given a Sermon of mine the Reading,
if I had put it into their Hands.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.579

But by this Means it came to be read, probably more than once, by every
Man of Eminence in the University.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.580

I left <font> Oxford <$$font> about Noon, WESLEY-174X-1,35.581

preached at <font> Wycombe <$$font> in the Evening, WESLEY-174X-1,35.582

and on <font> Sat. <$$font> 25. returned to <font> London.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,35.583

<font> Sat. Sep. <$$font> 1.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.584

I talked pretty largely $with {TEXT:wrth} <font> George Newans, <$$font>
the supposed <font> Shropshire <$$font> Prophet.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.585

I am inclined to think, he believes himself: WESLEY-174X-1,35.586

But I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} believe God has sent him.
WESLEY-174X-1,35.587

<font> Wedn. <$$font> 5.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.588

One sent me Word,"He had now found the right Way of worshipping God:
and therefore he must leave off Prayer and the rest of our Will-Worship,
and join himself with the <font> Quakers.  <$$font> "WESLEY-174X-1,35.589

However in the Evening, he ventured among us once more.
WESLEY-174X-1,35.590

And God smote him to the Heart: so that he knew and felt and declared
aloud, that he had no need of going elsewhere to find the Power of God
unto Salvation.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.591

<font> Thurs. <$$font> 6.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.592

I committed to the Dust the Remains of <font> Elizabeth Marsh, <$$font>
a young Woman who had $received {TEXT:reeeived} a Sense of the pardoning
Love of God about four Years before her Death, and had never left her
first Love.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.593

She had scarce known Health or Ease from that Hour.  WESLEY-174X-1,35.594

But she never murmured or repined at <P_36> any thing.
WESLEY-174X-1,36.595

I saw her many times after she was confined to her Bed;
WESLEY-174X-1,36.596

and found her always quiet and calm, always cheerful, praising
God in the Fires; though longing to depart and to be with Christ.
WESLEY-174X-1,36.597

I could not learn that her Mind was ever clouded, no, not a Moment,
from the Beginning of her Illness.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.598

But a few Days before she died, she told me,"I am concerned I spoke a
hasty Word to-day.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.599

One told me, You shall recover within ten Days.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.600

And I said,"I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want to recover. "
WESLEY-174X-1,36.601

A little before her Speech fail'd, she beckoned one to her,
WESLEY-174X-1,36.602

and said,"Go WESLEY-174X-1,36.603

and tell <font> Molly Brown <$$font> from me, she must come back to
Mr. <font> Wesley.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,36.604

I have not Breath to speak to her myself: WESLEY-174X-1,36.605

but do <font> you <$$font> tell her, she <font> must <$$font> come back.
"WESLEY-174X-1,36.606

She had lost her Voice when I prayed with her the last Time, and commended
her Soul to God.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.607

But"Her Eye dropt Sense, distinct and clear, As any Muse's tongue cou'd
speak. "WESLEY-174X-1,36.608

It said,"To me, to die is gain.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.609

I walk thro'the Valley of the Shadow of Death, WESLEY-174X-1,36.610

and fear no Evil. "WESLEY-174X-1,36.611

I could only speak a few Words at her Grave.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.612

But when I returned to the <font> Foundery, <$$font> God made his Word
as a Flame of Fire.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.613

I spoke from that passage in the <font> Revelation, And one of the
Elders said unto me, What are these who are arrayed in white Robes;
WESLEY-174X-1,36.614

and whence came they?  WESLEY-174X-1,36.615

And I said, Sir, thou knowest.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.616

And he said unto me, these are they which came out of great Tribulation
, and have washed their Garments, and made them white in the Blood of
the Lamb.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,36.617

A young Man, Servant to Mrs. <font> C. <$$font> of <font>
Newington, <$$font> went home deeply affected.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.618

The next Day he was taken ill, WESLEY-174X-1,36.619

and every Day grew worse; so that when I came to the House on <font>
Monday, <$$font> the 10th, <paren> though I knew nothing of him, or of
his Ilness {COM:sic} before <$$paren> he was just gasping for Breath.
WESLEY-174X-1,36.620

It was a melancholy Sight.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.621

Both his Words and his Eyes"witnessed huge Affliction and Dismay.
"WESLEY-174X-1,36.622

Death stared him in the Face, WESLEY-174X-1,36.623

and he knew not God.  WESLEY-174X-1,36.624

He could but just say,"For God's Sake, pray for me. " WESLEY-174X-1,36.625

<P_37>

<font> John Nelson <$$font> coming in, we asked Life for our Brother,
in full Confidence of the Promise.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.627

All this Day as his Illness so his Terrors increased.
WESLEY-174X-1,37.628

But the next Day, God gave him Life from the Dead.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.629

He told me,"Now I am not afraid to die: WESLEY-174X-1,37.630

for I know God loves me.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.631

I did not use to love you or your People: WESLEY-174X-1,37.632

but now I love you as my own Soul.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.633

I love you all: WESLEY-174X-1,37.634

I know you are the People of God; WESLEY-174X-1,37.635

and I am just going to Him. "WESLEY-174X-1,37.636

He continued praising God as often as he could speak, WESLEY-174X-1,37.637

and when he could not, his Eyes were fixt upwards.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.638

Between One and two on <font> Wednesday <$$font> Morning he cried out,
"I have lost my God?  WESLEY-174X-1,37.639

where is He?  WESLEY-174X-1,37.640

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} see Him. "WESLEY-174X-1,37.641

But he soon recovered himself WESLEY-174X-1,37.642

and said,"Now I have found Him: WESLEY-174X-1,37.643

and I shall lose Him no more. "WESLEY-174X-1,37.644

About Seven I prayed with him, WESLEY-174X-1,37.645

and praised God on his Behalf; WESLEY-174X-1,37.646

and not long after he fell asleep.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.647

<font> Fri. <$$font> 14.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.648

I performed the last Office <paren> according to his Desire <$$paren>
over his Body, which was interr'd in the Presence of a vast Multitude
of People, at a small Distance from that of <font> Elizabeth Marsh.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,37.649

<font> Sun. <$$font> 16.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.650

I buried near the same Place, one who had soon finished her Course,
going to God in the full Assurance of Faith, when she was little more
than four Years old.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.651

In her last Sickness <paren> having been deeply serious in her Behaviour
for several Months before <$$paren> she spent all the Intervals of her
Convulsions, in speaking of, or to God.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.652

And when she perceived her Strength to be near exhausted, she desired
all the Family to come near, WESLEY-174X-1,37.653

and pray'd for them all, one by one; then for her Ministers, for the
Church, and for all the World.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.654

A short time after, recovering from a Fit, she lifted up her Eyes,
WESLEY-174X-1,37.655

said,"Thy Kingdom come,"WESLEY-174X-1,37.656

and died.  WESLEY-174X-1,37.657

All this Summer, our Brethren in the West had as hot Service, as those
in the North of <font> England.  <$$font> The War against the <font>
Methodists, <$$font> so called, being every where carried on, with
far more Vigour than that against the <font> Spaniards.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,37.658

I had Accounts of this from all Parts: one of which was as follows.
WESLEY-174X-1,37.659

<P_38>

<font> Rev. Sir, <$$font>"The Word of God has free Course here ,
WESLEY-174X-1,38.661

it runs WESLEY-174X-1,38.662

and is glorified.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.663

But the Devil rages horribly.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.664

Even at <font> St. Ives, <$$font> we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} shut
the Doors of <font> John Nance <$$font>'s House, to meet the Society,
but the Mob immediately threaten to break them open.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.665

They now triumph over us more and more, saying, It is plain, nothing
can be done against them.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.666

And in other Places it is worse.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.667

I was going to <font> Crouan <$$font> on <font> Tuesday <$$font> was
sennight: WESLEY-174X-1,38.668

on the Road two of our Brothers met me.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.669

When we came within a Mile of the House, we saw a great Mob at some
Distance; WESLEY-174X-1,38.670

but they were going another Way.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.671

We then left our Horses at the House of a Friend, WESLEY-174X-1,38.672

and went forward on Foot.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.673

Within a Quarter of a Mile of the Place where I was to preach, two
Persons met us, who used to be Persecutors.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.674

But they now desired me, for God's Sake,"Not to go up:
WESLEY-174X-1,38.675

for if I did, they said, there would surely be murder: if there was not
already; WESLEY-174X-1,38.676

for many were knocked down before they came away.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.677

By their Advice and the Intreaties of those that were with me, I turned
back to the House where we left our Horses.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.678

We had been there but a short Time, when many of the People came, being
very bloody, and having been beaten very bad.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.679

But the main Cry of the Mob was after the Preacher, whom they sought for,
in every Corner of the House; swearing bitterly"They only wanted to knock
him on the Head, and then they should be satisfied.  "WESLEY-174X-1,38.680

Not finding me there, they said, However they should catch him on <font>
Sunday <$$font> at <font> Cambourn.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,38.681

But it was Mr. <font> Westell <$$font>'s Turn to go thither on
<font> Sunday.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,38.682

While he was preaching there, at <font> Mr. Harris <$$font>
's House, a tall Man came in, WESLEY-174X-1,38.683

and pulled him down.  WESLEY-174X-1,38.684

Mr. <font> Harris <$$font> demanded his Warrant.
WESLEY-174X-1,38.685

But he swore,"Warrant or no Warrant, he should go with them:
"WESLEY-174X-1,38.686

So he carried him out to the Mob, who took him away to the Church-town.
WESLEY-174X-1,38.687

They kept him there till <font> Tuesday <$$font> <P_39> Morning,
WESLEY-174X-1,39.688

and then carried him to <font> Penzance: <$$font> where, in the Afternoon,
he was brought before three Justices, and asked abundance of Questions,
to which they required him to answer upon Oath.  WESLEY-174X-1,39.689

Then Dr. <font> Barlost <$$font> wrote his <font> Mittimus <$$font>
, by Virtue of which he was to be committed to the House of Correction
at <font> Bodmin <$$font> as a Vagrant.  WESLEY-174X-1,39.690

So they took him as far as <font> Cambourn <$$font> that Night; and the
next Day, on to <font> Bodmin.  <$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,39.691

I desire your continual Prayers for me, Your weak Servant in Christ,
<font> Henry Milliard.  <$$font>"WESLEY-174X-1,39.692

I pray, for what Pay, could we procure Men to do this Service?  To be
always ready, to go to Prison, or to Death?  WESLEY-174X-1,39.693

<font> Henry Milliard <$$font> did not long continue therein.
WESLEY-174X-1,39.694

After he had for some time fought a good Fight, he took the Small-pox,
WESLEY-174X-1,39.695

and in a few Days, joyfully resigned his Spirit to God.
WESLEY-174X-1,39.696

The Justices who met at the next Quarter-Sessions at <font> Bodmin,
<$$font> knowing a little more of the Laws of God and Man, declared
Mr. <font> Westell <$$font>'s Commitment to be contrary to all
Law, WESLEY-174X-1,39.697

and set him at Liberty without delay.  WESLEY-174X-1,39.698

<font> Tues. Oct. <$$font> 30.  WESLEY-174X-1,39.699

I was desired to call on a young Gentlewoman dangerously ill.
WESLEY-174X-1,39.700

But I soon found, she needed no Physician for her Soul, being full of
Righteousness and Good Works.  WESLEY-174X-1,39.701

However I spoke to her with all Plainness: WESLEY-174X-1,39.702

and she awoke as one out of Sleep.  WESLEY-174X-1,39.703

She drank in every Word, WESLEY-174X-1,39.704

and soon perceived the Want of a better Righteousness than her own
{TEXT:missing_period} WESLEY-174X-1,39.705

But her Companion sent her Father word, WESLEY-174X-1,39.706

and she was immediately removed; so that I saw her no more.
WESLEY-174X-1,39.707

<font> Sun. Nov {TEXT:missing_period} <$$font> 4.
WESLEY-174X-1,39.708

Poor <font> Richard I. <$$font> who in spite of his former
Conviction, was now determined to renounce us and join the <font>
Quakers <$$font>, ventured however once more to the Lord's Table.
WESLEY-174X-1,39.709

He had no sooner received, <P_40> than he dropt down, WESLEY-174X-1,40.710

and cried with a loud Voice,"I have sinned; WESLEY-174X-1,40.711

I have sinned against God. "WESLEY-174X-1,40.712

At that Instant, many were pierced to the Heart.  WESLEY-174X-1,40.713

I could hardly speak for some time.  WESLEY-174X-1,40.714

Several Mourners were filled with strong Consolation.
WESLEY-174X-1,40.715

And all said,"Surely God is in this Place! "WESLEY-174X-1,40.716

About this Time I received a Letter, dated from the Camp at <font> Lisle.
<$$font> WESLEY-174X-1,40.717

Part of it ran as follows.  WESLEY-174X-1,40.718

"<font> May <$$font> 1.  WESLEY-174X-1,40.719

We marched to the Camp, near <font> Brussels.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,40.720

There a few of us join'd into a Society, being sensible, where two or
three are gathered together in His Name, there is our Lord in the midst
of them.  WESLEY-174X-1,40.721

Our Place of Meeting was a small Wood near the Camp.  WESLEY-174X-1,40.722

We remained in this Camp eight Days, WESLEY-174X-1,40.723

and then removed to a Place called <font> Arsk.  <$$font>
WESLEY-174X-1,40.724

Here I began to speak openly, at a small Distance from the Camp, just
in the middle of the <font> English <$$font> Army. "WESLEY-174X-1,40.725
