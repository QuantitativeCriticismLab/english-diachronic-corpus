Florence, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.3

March 6, 1740 N. S. WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.4

Harry, my dear, one would tell you what a monster you are, if one
were not sure your conscience tells you so every time you think of me.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.5

At Genoa, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
thirty-nine, I received the last letter from you; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.6

by your not writing to me since, I imagine you propose to make this
leap year.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.7

I should have sent many a scold after you in this long interval, had I
known where to have scolded; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.8

but you told me you should leave Geneva immediately.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.9

I have dispatched sundry enquiries into England after you, all fruitless.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,3.10

At last drops in a chance letter to lady Sophy Farmor from a girl at
Paris, that <P_5,4> tells her for news, Mr. Henry Conway is here.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.11

Is he indeed?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.12

and why was I to know it only by this scrambling way?
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.13

Well, I hate you for this neglect, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.14

but I find I love you well enough to tell you so.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.15

But, dear now, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} let one fall into a train of excuses
and reproaches; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.16

if the god of indolence is a mightier deity with you than the god
of caring for one, tell me, and I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} dun you;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.17

but will drop your correspondence as silently as if I owed you money.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.18

If my private consistency was of no weight with you; yet is a man nothing
who is within three days journey of a conclave?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.19

nay, for what you knew I might have been in Rome.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.20

Harry, art thou so indifferent, as to have a cousin at the election of
a pope without courting him for news?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.21

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you, were I any where else, and even Dick H- were
at Rome, I think verily I should have wrote to him.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.22

Popes, cardinals, adorations, coronations, St. Peters!
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.23

oh, what costly sounds!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.24

and $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you write to one yet?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.25

I shall set out in about a fortnight, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.26

and pray then think me of consequence.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.27

I have crept on upon time from day to day here; fond of Florence to a
degree: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.28

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} infinitely the most agreeable of all the places I
have seen since London: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.29

that you know one loves, right or wrong, as one does one's nurse.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.30

Our little Arno is not boated and swelling like the Thames,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.31

but $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} vastly pretty, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.32

and, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know how, being Italian, has something
visionary and poetical in its stream.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.33

Then $one $'s {TEXT:one's} unwilling to leave the gallery,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.34

and - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.35

but - in short, $one $'s {TEXT:one's} unwilling to get into a post-chaise.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.36

I am as surfeited with mountains and inns, as if I had eat them.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.37

I have many to pass before I see England again, and no Tory to entertain
me on the road!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.38

Well, this thought makes me dull, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.39

and that makes me finish.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.40

Adieu!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.41

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.42

P.S.  Direct to me, <paren> for to be sure you will not be so outrageous
as to leave me quite off <$$paren> recommande` a` mons. Mann,
ministre de sa majeste` Britannique a` Florence.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,4.43

<P_5,5>

{ED:Letter_II}

Rome, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.46

April 23, 1740 N. S. WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.47

As I have wrote you two such long letters lately, my dear Hal, I did
not hurry myself to answer your last; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.48

but chose to write to poor Selwyn upon his illness.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.49

I pity you excessively upon finding him in such a situation:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.50

what a shock it must have been to you!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.51

He deserves so much love from all that know him, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.52

and you owe him so much friendship, that I can scarce conceive a greater
shock.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.53

I am very glad you did not write to me till he was out of danger;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.54

for this great distance would have added to my pain, as I must have
waited so long for another letter.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.55

I charge you, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} let him relapse into balls;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.56

he does not love them, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.57

and, if you please, your example may keep him out of them.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.58

You are extremely pretty people to be dancing and trading with French
poulterers and pastry-cooks, when a hard frost is starving half the
nation, and the Spanish war ought to be employing the other half.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.59

We are much more public-spirited here; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.60

we live upon the public news, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.61

and triumph abundantly upon the taking Porto-Bello.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.62

If you are not entirely debauched with your balls, you must be
pleased with an answer of lord Hartington's to the governor of Rome.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.63

He asked him what they had determined about the vessel that the Spaniards
took under the cannon of Civita Vecchia, whether they had restored it
to the English?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.64

The governor said, they had done justice.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.65

My lord replied,"If you had not, we should have done it ourselves.
"WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.66

Pray reverence our spirit, lieutenant Hal.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.67

Sir, Moscovita is not a pretty woman, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.68

and she does sing ill; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.69

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} all.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.70

My dear Harry, I must now tell you a little about myself, and answer
your questions.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.71

How I like the inanimate part of Rome you will soon perceive at my
arrival in England; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.72

I am far gone in medals, lamps, idols, prints, &c. and
all the small commodities to the purchase of which I can attain;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.73

I would buy the Coliseum if I could: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.74

judge.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.75

My mornings are spent in the most agreeable manner; my evenings ill
enough.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.76

Roman conversations are dreadful things!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.77

such untoward mawkins as the princesses!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.78

and the princes are worse.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.79

Then the whole city is littered with French and German abbe`s, who make
up a dismal contrast with the inhabitants.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,5.80

<P_5,6>

The conclave is far from enlivening us; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.82

its secrets $do $n't {TEXT:don't} transpire.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.83

I could give you names of this cardinal and that, that are talked of,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.84

but each is contradicted the next hour.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.85

I was there t'other day to visit one of them, and one of the most
agreeable, Alexander Albani.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.86

I had the opportunity of two cardinals making their entry:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.87

upon that occasion the gate is unlocked, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.88

and their eminencies come to talk to their acquaintance over the
threshold.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.89

I have received great civilities from him I named to you,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.90

and I wish he were out, that I might receive greater:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.91

a friend of his does the honours of Rome for him; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.92

but you know that it is unpleasant to visit by proxy.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.93

Card. Delci, the object of the Corsini faction, is dying;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.94

the hot weather will probably dispatch half a dozen more.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.95

Not that it is hot yet; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.96

I am now writing to you by my fire-side.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.97

Harry, you saw lord Deskfoord at Geneva; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.98

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} you like him?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.99

He is a mighty sensible man.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.100

There are few young people have so good understandings.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.101

He is mighty grave, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.102

and so are you; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.103

but you can both be pleasant when you have a mind.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.104

Indeed one can make you pleasant, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.105

but his solemn <font> Scotchery <$$font> is a little formidable:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.106

before you I can play the fool from morning to night, courageously.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.107

Good night.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.108

I have other letters to write, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.109

and must finish this.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.110

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.111

{ED:Letter_III}

Florence, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.113

March 25, 1741 N. S. WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.114

Dear Hal, You must judge by what you feel yourself of what I feel for
Selwyn's recovery, with the addition of what I have suffered from post
to post.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.115

But as I find the whole town have had the same sentiments about him,
<paren> though I am sure few so strong as myself <$$paren> I will not
repeat what you have heard so much.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.116

I shall write to him to-night, though he knows without my telling him
how very much I love him.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.117

To you, my dear Harry, I am infinitely obliged for the three successive
letters you wrote me about him, which gave me double pleasure, as they
shewed your attention for me at a time that you knew I must be so unhappy;
and your friendship for him.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,6.118

<P_5,7>

Your account of sir Robert's victory was so extremely well told, that I
made Gray translate it into French, and have showed it to all that could
taste it, or were inquisitive on the occasion.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.120

I have received a print by this post that diverts me extremely; <font>
the Motion.  <$$font> WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.121

Tell me, dear now, who made the design, and who took the likenesses;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.122

they are admirable: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.123

the lines are as good as one sees on such occasions.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.124

I wrote last post to sir Robert, to wish him joy; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.125

I hope he received my letter.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.126

I was to have set out last Tuesday, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.127

but on Sunday came the news of the queen of Hungary being brought to
bed of a son; on which occasion here will be great triumphs, operas and
masquerades, which detain me for a short time.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.128

I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} make you any excuse for sending you the following
lines; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.129

you have prejudice enough for me to read with patience any of my
idlenesses.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.130

My dear Harry, you enrage me with talking of another journey to Ireland
; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.131

it will shock me if I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} find you at my return:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.132

pray take care WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.133

and be in England.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.134

I wait with some patience to see Dr. Middleton's Tully, as I read
the greatest part of it in manuscript; though indeed that is rather a
reason for my being impatient to read the rest.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.135

If Tully can receive any additional honour, Dr. Middleton is most
capable of conferring it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.136

I receive with great pleasure any remembrances of my lord and your
sisters; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.137

I long to see all of you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.138

Patapan is so handsome that he has been named the silver fleece;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.139

and there is a new order of knighthood to be erected to his honour,
in opposition to the golden.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.140

Precedents are searching, and plans drawing up for that purpose.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.141

I hear that the natives pretend to be companions, upon the authority of
their dog-skin waistcoats; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.142

but a council that has been held on purpose has declared their pretensions
impertinent.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,7.143

Patapan has lately taken wife unto him, as ugly as he is genteel, but
of a very great family, being the direct heiress of Canis Scaliger
, lord of <P_5,8> Verona: which principality we design to seize a`
la Prussienne; that is, as soon as ever we shall have persuaded the
republic of Venice, that we are the best friends they have in the world.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.144

Adieu, dear child!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.145

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.146

P.S.  I left my subscriptions for Middleton's Tully with Mr.
Selwyn; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.147

I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} trouble him, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.148

but I wish you would take care and get the books, if Mr. S.
has kept the list.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.149

Re di Cofano, vulg. Radicofani, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.151

July 5, 1740 N. S. WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.152

You will wonder, my dear Hal, to find me on the road from Rome:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.153

why, intend I did to stay for a new popedom, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.154

but the old eminences are cross and obstinate, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.155

and will not choose one, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.156

the holy ghost does not know when.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.157

There is a horrid thing called the mal'aria, that comes to Rome every
summer and kills one, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.158

and I did not care for being killed so far from Christian burial.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.159

We have been jolted to death; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.160

my servants let us come without springs to the chaise,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.161

and we are wore threadbare: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.162

to add to our disasters, I have sprained my ankle, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.163

and have brought it along, laid upon a little box of bawbles that I have
bought for presents in England.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.164

Perhaps I may pick you out some little trifle there,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.165

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} depend upon it; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.166

you are a disagreeable creature, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.167

and $maybe {TEXT:may_be} I shall not care for you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.168

Though I am so tired in this devil of a place, yet I have taken it
into my head, that it is like Hamilton's Bawn, and I must write to you.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.169

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} the top of a black barren mountain, a vile little
town at the foot of an old citadel: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.170

yet this, know you, was the residence of one of the three kings that
went to Christ's birth-day; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.171

his name was Alabaster, Abarasser, or some such thing;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.172

the other two were kings, one of the East, the other of Cologn.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.173

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} this of Cofano, who was represented in an ancient
painting, found in the Palatine Mount, now in the possession of Dr.
Mead; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.174

he was crowned by Augustus.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.175

Well, but about writing - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.176

what do you think I write with?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,8.177

<P_5,9>

Nay, with a pen; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.179

there was never a one to be found in the whole circumference <font>
but one <$$font>, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.180

and that was in the possession of the governor, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.181

and had been used time out of mind to write the parole with:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.182

I was forced to send to borrow it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.183

It was sent me under the conduct of a Serjeant and two Swiss, with desire
to return it when I should have done with it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.184

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a curiosity, and worthy to be laid up with the relics
which we have just been seeing in a small hovel of Capucins on the side
of the hill, and which were all brought by his majesty from Jerusalem.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.185

Among other things of great sanctity there is a set of gnashing of teeth,
the grinders very entire; a bit of the worm that never dies, preserved in
spirits; a crow of St. Peter's cock, very useful against Easter;
the crisping and curling, frizzling and frowncing of Mary Magdalen,
which she cut off on growing devout.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.186

The good man that showed us all these commodities was got into such a
train of calling them the blessed this, and the blessed that, that at
last he showed us a bit of the blessed fig-tree that Christ cursed.

Florence, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.188

July 9.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.189

My dear Harry, We are come hither, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.190

and I have received another letter from you with Hosier's Ghost.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.191

Your last put me in pain for you, when you talked of going to Ireland;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.192

but now I find your brother and sister go with you, I am not much
concerned.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.193

Should I be?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.194

You have but to say, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.195

for my feelings are extremely at your service to dispose as you please.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.196

Let us see: you are to come back to stand for some place;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.197

that will be about April.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.198

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a sort of thing I should do too;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.199

and then we should see one another, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.200

and that would be charming: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.201

but it is a sort of thing I have no mind to do; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.202

and then we shall not see one another, unless you would come hither -
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.203

but that you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.204

nay, I would not have you, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.205

for then I shall be gone.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.206

- So!  there are many <font> ifs <$$font> that just signify nothing
at all.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.207

Return I must sooner than I shall like.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.208

I am happy here to a degree.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.209

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you my situation.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.210

I am lodged with Mr. Mann, the best of creatures.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.211

I have a terreno all to myself, with an open gallery on the Arno, where
I am now writing to you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.212

Over against me is the famous Gallery; and, on either hand, two fair
bridges.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.213

Is not this charming and cool?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,9.214

The air is so serene, and so secure, that one sleeps with all the windows
and doors thrown open <P_5,10> to the river, and only covered with a
slight gauze to keep away the gnats.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.215

Lady Pomfret has a charming conversation once a week.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.216

She has taken a vast palace and a vast garden, which is vastly commode ,
especially to the cicisbeo-part of mankind, who have free indulgence to
wander in pairs about the arbours.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.217

You know her daughters: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.218

lady Sophia is still, nay she must be, the beauty she was:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.219

lady Charlotte is much improved, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.220

and is the cleverest girl in the world; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.221

speaks the purest Tuscan like any Florentine.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.222

The princess Craon has a constant pharaoh and supper every night, where
one is quite at one's ease.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.223

I am going into the country with her and the prince for a little while,
to a villa of the great duke's.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.224

The people are good-humoured here and easy; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.225

and what makes me pleased with them, they are pleased with me.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.226

One loves to find people care for one, when they can have no view in it.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.227

You see how glad I am to have reasons for not returning;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.228

I wish I had no better.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.229

As to Hosier's Ghost, I think it very easy, and consequently pretty;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.230

but, from the ease, should never have guessed it Glover's.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.231

I delight in your, <font> the patriots cry it up, and the courtiers cry
it down, and the hawkers cry it up and down <$$font>, and your laconic
history of the K. and sir R. on going to Hanover, and
turning out the D. of A. WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.232

The epigram too you sent me on the same occasion is charming.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.233

Unless I sent you back news that you and others send me, I can send
you none.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.234

I have left the conclave, which is the only stirring thing in this
part of the world, except the child that the queen of Naples is to be
delivered of in August.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.235

There is no likelihood the conclave will end, unless the messages take
effect which $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} said the Imperial and French ministers
have sent to their respective courts for leave to quit the Corsini for
the Albani faction; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.236

otherwise there will never be a pope.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,10.237

Corsini has lost the only one he could <P_5,11> have ventured to make
pope, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.238

and him he designed; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.239

$'t $was {TEXT:'twas} Cenci, a relation of the Corsini's mistress.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.240

The last morning Corsini made him rise, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.241

stuffed a dish of chocolate down his throat, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.242

and would carry him to the scrutiny.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.243

The poor old creature went, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.244

came back, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.245

and died.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.246

I am sorry to have lost the sight of the pope's coronation,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.247

but I might have staid for seeing it till I had been old enough to be
pope myself.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.248

Harry, what luck the chancellor has!  first, indeed, to be in himself
so great a man; but then in accidents: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.249

he is made chief justice and peer, when Talbot is made chancellor and
peer: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.250

Talbot dies in a twelvemonth, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.251

and leaves him the seals at an age when others are scarce made solicitors
: - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.252

then marries his son into one of the first families of Britain,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.253

obtains a patent for a marquisate and eight thousand pounds a year after
the duke of Kent's death: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.254

the duke dies in a fortnight, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.255

and leaves them all!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.256

People talk of fortune's wheel that is always rolling:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.257

troth, my lord Hardwicke has overtaken her wheel, and rolled along
with it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.258

I perceive miss Jenny would not venture to Ireland, nor stray so far
from London; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.259

I am glad I shall always know where to find her within three-score miles.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.260

I must say a word to my lord, which, Harry, be sure you $do $n't

<bracket>"My dear lord, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} love troubling you with
letters, because I know you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} love the trouble of
answering them; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.262

not that I should insist on that ceremony, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.263

but I hate to burthen any one's conscience.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.264

Your brother tells me he is to stand member of parliament:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.265

without telling me so, I am sure he owes it to you.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.266

I am sure you will not repent setting him up; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.267

nor will he be ungrateful to a brother who deserves so much, and
whose least merit is not the knowing how to employ so great a fortune.
"<$$bracket> WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.268

There, Harry, I have done.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.269

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} suspect me: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.270

I have said no ill of you behind your back.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.271

Make my best compliments to miss Conway.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.272

I thought I had done, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.273

and lo, I had forgot to tell you, that WALPOLE-174X-1,5,11.274

who $d $'ye {TEXT:d'ye} think <P_5,12> is here?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.275

pleasant sure.  <$$font> WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.276

At the end of the eighth side, I think I need make no excuse for leaving
off; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.277

but I am going to write to Selwyn, and to the lady of the mountain;
from whom I have had a very kind letter.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.278

She has at last received the Chantilly brass.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.279

Good night: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.280

Florence, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.284

September 25, 1740 N. S. WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.285

My dear Hal, I begin to answer your letter the moment I have read it,
because you bid me; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.286

but I grow so unfit for a correspondence with any body in England,
that I have almost left it off.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.287

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} so long since I was there, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.288

and I am so utterly a stranger to every thing that passes there, that
I must talk vastly in the dark to those I write; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.289

and having in a manner settled myself here, where there can be no news,
I am void of all matter for filling up a letter.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.290

As, by the absence of the great duke, Florence is become in a manner
a country town, you may imagine that we are not without deme`le`s;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.291

but for a country town I believe there never were a set of people so
peaceable, and such strangers to scandal.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.292

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} the family of love, where every body is paired,
and go as constantly together as perroquets.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.293

Here nobody hangs or drowns themselves; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.294

they are not ready to cut one another's throats about elections or
parties; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.295

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} think that wit consists in saying bold truths,
or humour in getting drunk.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.296

But I shall give you no more of their characters, because I am so
unfortunate as to think that their encomium consists in being the reverse
of the English, who in general are either mad, or enough to make other
people so.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.297

After telling you so fairly my sentiments, you may believe, my
dear Harry, that I had much rather see you here than in England.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,12.298

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} an evil wish for you, who <P_5,13> should not be
lost in so obscure a place as this.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.299

I will not make you compliments, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.300

or else here is a charming opportunity for saying what I think of you.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.301

As I am convinced you love me, and as I am conscious you have one strong
reason for it, I will own to you, that for my own peace you should wish
me to remain here.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.302

I am so well within and without, that you would scarce know me:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.303

I am younger than ever, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.304

think of nothing but diverting myself, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.305

and live in a round of pleasures.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.306

We have operas, concerts, and balls, mornings and evenings.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.307

I dare not tell you all one's idleness; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.308

you would look so grave and senatorial, at hearing that one rises at
eleven in the morning, goes to the opera at nine at night, to supper at
one, and to bed at three!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.309

But literally here the evenings and nights are so charming and so warm,
one $can $n't {TEXT:can't} avoid'em.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.310

Did I tell you lady - - is here?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.311

She laughs at my lady W-, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.312

scolds my lady Pomfret, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.313

and is laughed at by the whole town.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.314

Her dress, her avarice, and her impudence must amaze any one that never
heard her name.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.315

She wears a foul mob, that does not cover her greasy black locks, that
hang loose, never combed or curled; an old mazarine blue wrapper, that
gapes open and discovers a canvass petticoat.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.316

Her face swelled violently on one side with the remains of a -
{COM:word_omitted_in_original}, partly covered with a plaister, and
partly with white paint, which for cheapness she has bought so coarse,
that you would not use it to wash a chimney.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.317

- In three words I will give you her picture as we drew it in the Sortes
Virgilianae - Insanam vatem aspicies.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.318

I give you my honour, we did not choose it; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.319

but Gray, Mr. Cooke, sir Fr. Dashwood and I, and several
others, drew it fairly amongst a thousand for different people, most of
which did not hit as you may imagine: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.320

those that did I will tell you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.321

For our most religious and gracious - - Dii, talem terris avertite pestem.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,13.322

For one that would be our most religious and gracious - Purpureus veluti

My dearest Harry, Before I thank you for myself, I must thank you
for that excessive good nature you showed in writing to poor G-.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.332

I am less impatient to see you, as I find you are not the least
altered, but have the same tender friendly temper you always had.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.333

I wanted much to see if you were still the same - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.334

but you are.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.335

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} think of coming before your brother;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.336

he is too good to be left for any one living: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.337

besides, if it is possible, I will see you in the country.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.338

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} reproach me, and think nothing could draw me into
the country: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.339

impatience to see a few friends has drawn me out of Italy;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.340

and Italy, Harry, is pleasanter than London.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.341

As I do not love living en famille so much as you <paren> but then indeed
my family is not like yours <$$paren>, I am hurried about getting myself
a house; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.342

for I have so long lived single, that I do not much take to being confined
with {COM:blank} WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.343

You $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} find me much altered, I believe; at least,
outwardly.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.344

I am not grown a bit shorter, or a bit fatter, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,14.345

but am just the same long lean creature <P_5,15> as usual.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.346

Then I talk no French, but to my footman; nor Italian, but to myself.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.347

What inward alterations may have happened to me, you will discover best
; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.348

for you know $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} said, one never knows that one's self.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.349

I will answer, that that part of it that belongs to you, has not suffered
the least change - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.350

I took care of that.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.351

For virtu`, I have a little to entertain you: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.352

it is my sole pleasure.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.353

- I am neither young enough nor old enough to be in love.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.354

My dear Harry, will you take care and make my compliments to that
charming lady Conway, who I hear is so charming, and to miss Jenny,
who I know is so?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.355

As for miss Anne and her love <font> as far as it is decent <$$font>
; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.356

tell her, decency is out of the question between us, that I love her
without any restriction.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.357

I settled it yesterday with miss Conway, that you three are brothers and
sister to me, and that if you had been so, I could not love you better.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.358

I have so many cousins, and uncles and aunts, and bloods that grow in
Norfolk, that if I had portioned out my affections to them, as they say I
should, what a modicum would have fallen to each!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.359

- So, to avoid fractions, I love my family in you three, their
representatives.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.360

Adieu, my dear Harry!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.361

{ED:Letter_VII}

Arlington-street, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.366

July 20, 1744 WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.367

My dearest Harry, I feel that I have so much to say to you, that I foresee
there will be but little method in my letter; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.368

but if upon the whole you see my meaning, and the depth of my friendship
for you, I am content.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,15.369

<P_5,16>

It was most agreeable to me to receive a letter of confidence from you,
at the time I expected a very different one from you; though, by the
date of your last, I perceive you had not then received some letters,
which though I did not see I must call simple, as they could only tend
to make you uneasy for some months.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.371

I should not have thought of communicating a quarrel to you at this
distance; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.372

and I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} conceive the sort of friendship of those
that thought it necessary.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.373

When I heard it had been wrote to you, I thought it right to myself to
give you my account of it - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.374

but, by your brother's desire, suppressed my letter,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.375

and left it to be explained by him, who wrote to you so sensibly on it,
that I shall say no more; but that I think myself so ill used, that
it will prevent my giving you thoroughly the advice you ask of me;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.376

for how can I be sure that my resentment might not make me see in a
stronger light the reasons for your breaking off an affair, which you
know before I never approved?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.377

You know my temper is so open to any body I love, that I must be happy
at seeing you lay aside a reserve with me, which is the only point that
ever made me dissatisfied with you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.378

That silence of yours has, perhaps, been one of the chief reasons that
has always prevented my saying much to you on a topic which I saw was
so near your heart.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.379

Indeed, its being so near was another reason; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.380

for how could I expect you would take my advice, even if you bore it?
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.381

But, my dearest Harry, how can I advise you now?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.382

Is it not gone too far for me to expect you should keep any resolution
about it; especially in absence which must be destroyed the moment you
meet again?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.383

And if you ever should marry and be happy, $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} you
reproach me with having tried to hinder it?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.384

- I think you as just, and honest, as I think any man living.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.385

But any man living in that circumstance would think I had been prompted
by private reasons.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.386

I see as strongly as you can, all the arguments for your breaking off;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.387

but indeed the alteration of your fortune adds very little strength to
what they had before.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.388

You never had fortune enough to make such a step at all prudent:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.389

she loved you enough to be content with that; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.390

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} believe this change will alter her sentiments,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.391

for I must do her the justice to say, that $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} plain
she preferred you with nothing to all the world.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.392

I could talk on upon this head; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,16.393

but I will only leave you to consider, without <P_5,17> advising you on
either side, these two things: whether you think it honester to break
off with her after such engagements as yours <paren> how strong I $do
$n't {TEXT:don't} know <$$paren>, after her refusing very good matches
for you, and show her that she must think of making her fortune; or
whether you will wait with her till some amendment in your fortune can
put it in your power to marry her.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.394

My dearest Harry, you must see why I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care to say
more on this head.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.395

My wishing it could be right for you to break off with her <paren> for,
without it is right, I would not have you on any account take such a step
<$$paren> makes it impossible for me to advise it; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.396

and therefore I am sure you will forgive my declining an act of friendship
, which your having put in my power gives me the greatest satisfaction.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.397

But it does put something else in my power, which I am sure nothing
can make me decline, and for which I have long wanted an opportunity.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.398

Nothing could prevent my being unhappy at the smallness of your
fortune, but its throwing it into my way to offer you to share mine.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.399

As mine is so precarious, by depending on so bad a constitution, I can
only offer you the immediate use of it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.400

I do that most sincerely.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.401

My places still <paren> though my lord W. has cut off three
hundred pounds a year to save himself the trouble of signing his name
ten times for once <$$paren> bring me in near two thousand pounds a year.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.402

I have no debts, no connections; indeed no way to dispose of it
particularly.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.403

By living with my father, I have little real use for a quarter of it.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.404

I have always flung it away all in the most idle manner.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.405

But, my dear Harry, idle as I am, and thoughtless, I have sense enough
to have real pleasure in denying myself bawbles, and in saving a very
good income to make a man happy for whom I have a just esteem and most
sincere friendship.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.406

I know the difficulties any gentleman and man of spirit must struggle
with, even in having such an offer made him, much more in accepting it.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.407

I hope you will allow there are some in making it.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.408

But hear me: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.409

if there is any such thing as friendship in the world, these are the
opportunities of exerting it, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.410

and it $can $n't {TEXT:can't} be exerted without $'t $is {TEXT:'tis}
accepted.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.411

I must talk of myself to prove to you that it will be right for you to
accept it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.412

I am sensible of having more follies and weaknesses and fewer real good
qualities than most men.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.413

I sometimes reflect on this, though I own too seldom.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.414

I always want to begin acting like a man and a sensible one, which I
think I might be if I would.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.415

Can I begin better, than by taking care of my fortune for one I love?
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.416

You have seen <paren> I have seen you have <$$paren> that I am fickle,
and foolishly fond of twenty new people: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,17.417

but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} really love <P_5,18> them:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.418

I have always loved you constantly: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.419

I am willing to convince you and the world, what I have always told you,
that I loved you better than any body.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.420

If I ever felt much for any thing, which I know may be questioned,
it was certainly for my mother.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.421

I look on you as my nearest relation by her, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.422

and think I can never do enough to show my gratitude and affection to her.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.423

For these reasons, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} deny me what I have set my
heart on - the making your fortune easy to you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.424

{ED:Letter_VIII}

Houghton, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.427

Oct. 6, 1744 WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.428

My dearest Harry, My lord bids me tell you how much he is obliged to
you for your letter, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.429

and hopes you will accept my answer for his.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.430

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you what, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.431

we shall both be obliged to you if you will inclose a magnifying glass
in your next letters; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.432

for your two last were in so diminutive a character, that we were forced
to employ all Mrs. Leneve's spectacles, besides an ancient family
reading-glass with which my grandfather used to begin the psalm, to
discover what you said to us.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.433

Besides this, I have a piece of news for you: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.434

sir Robert Walpole, when he was made earl of Orford, left the ministry,
and with it the palace in Downing-street; as numbers of people found out
three years ago, who not having your integrity were quick in perceiving
the change of his situation.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.435

Your letter was full as honest as you; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.436

for, though directed to Downing-street, it would not, as other
letters would have done, address itself to the present possessor.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.437

Do but think if it had!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.438

The smallness of the hand would have immediately struck my lord Sandys
with the idea of a plot; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.439

for what he could not read at first sight, he would certainly have
concluded must be cypher.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.440

I march next week towards London, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,18.441

and have already begun to send my heavy artillery before me, consisting of
half a dozen books and part of my <P_5,19> linen; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.442

my light horse commanded by Patapan follows this day se'nnight.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.443

A detachment of hussars surprised an old bitch fox yesterday morning,
who had lost a leg in a former engagement; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.444

and then having received advice of another litter being advanced as far
as Dasingham, lord Walpole commanded captain Riley's horse with a strong
party of fox-hounds to overtake them: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.445

but on the approach of our troops the enemy stole off,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.446

and are now encamped at Sechford common, whither we every hour expect
orders to pursue them.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.447

My dear Harry, this is all I have to tell you, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.448

and to my great joy, which you must forgive me, is full as memorable as
any part of the Flanders campaign.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.449

I do not desire to have you engaged in the least more glory than you
have been.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.450

I should not love the remainder of you the least better for your having
lost an arm or a leg; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.451

and have as full persuasion of your courage as if you had contributed to
the slicing off twenty pair from French officers.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.452

Thank God, you have sense enough to content yourself without being a
hero; though I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} quite forget your expedition a
hussar-hunting the beginning of this campaign.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.453

- Pray, no more of those jaunts!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.454

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know any body you would oblige with a present
of such game: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.455

for my part, a fragment of the oldest hussar on earth should never have
a place in my museum; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.456

they are not antique enough: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.457

and for a live one, I must tell you I like my racoon {COM:sic} infinitely
better.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.458

Adieu, my dear Harry!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.459

I long to see you.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.460

- You will easily believe, the thought I have of being particularly
well with you is a vast addition to my impatience; though you know it is
nothing new to me to be overjoyed at your return.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.461

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.462

{ED:Letter_IX}

Arlington-street, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.464

May 27, 1745.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.465

My dear Harry, As gloriously as you have set out, yet I despair of seeing
you a perfect hero!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,19.466

You have none of the charming violences that are so essential to that
<P_5,20> character.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.467

You write as coolly after behaving well in a battle, as you fought in it.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.468

Can your friends flatter themselves with seeing you one day or other be
the death of thousands, when you wish for peace in three weeks after your
first engagement, and laugh at the ambition of those men who have given
you this opportunity of distinguishing yourself?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.469

With the person of an Orondates, and the courage, you have all the
compassion, the reason, and the reflection, of one that never read
a romance.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.470

Can one ever hope you will make a figure, when you only fight because
it was right you should, and not because you hated the French, or loved
destroying mankind?  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.471

This is so un-English, or so un-heroic, that I despair of you!
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.472

Thank Heaven, you have one spice of madness!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.473

Your admiration of your master leaves me a glimmering of hope that you
will not be always so unreasonably reasonable.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.474

Do you remember the humorous lieutenant, in one of Beaumont and
$Fletcher $'s {TEXT:Fletcher's} plays, that is in love with the king?
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.475

Indeed your master is not behind hand with you; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.476

you seem to have agreed to puff one another.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.477

If you are all acting up to the strictest rules of war and chivalry in
Flanders, we are not less scrupulous on this side the water in fulfilling
all the duties of the same order.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.478

The day the young volunteer departed for the army <paren> unluckily
indeed it was after the battle <$$paren>, his tender mother Sisygambis
, and the beautiful Statira, a lady formerly known in your history by
the name of Artemisia, from her cutting off her hair on your absence,
were so afflicted and so inseparable, that they made a party together
to Mr. <font> Graham's <$$font> <paren> you may read <font> Iapis
<$$font> if you please <$$paren> to be blooded.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.479

It was settled that this was a more precious way of expressing concern
than shaving the head, which has been known to be attended with false
locks the next day.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.480

For the other princess you wot of, who is not entirely so tall as the
former, nor so evidently descended from a line of monarchs - I $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} hear her talk of retiring.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,20.481

At present she is employed in buying up all the nose-gays in Covent
Garden, and laurel-leaves at the pastry-cooks', to weave <P_5,21>
chaplets for the return of her hero.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.482

Who that is, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} pretend to know or guess.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.483

All I know is, that in this age retirement is not one of the fashionable
expressions of passion.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.484

Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.485

{ED:Letter_X}

Arlington-street, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.487

July 1, 1745.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.488

My dear Harry, If it were not for that one slight inconvenience, that
I should probably be dead now, I should have liked much better to have
lived in the last war than in this; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.489

I mean as to the pleasantness of writing letters.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.490

Two or three battles won, two or three towns taken, in a summer,
were pretty objects to keep up the liveliness of a correspondence.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.491

But now it hurts one's dignity to be talking of English and French armies
, at the first period of our history in which the tables are turned.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.492

After having learnt to spell out of the reigns of Edward the third
and Harry the fifth, and begun lisping with Agincourt and Cressy, one
uses one's self but awkwardly to the sounds of Tournay and Fontenoy.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.493

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like foreseeing the time so near, when all the
young orators in parliament will be haranguing out of Demosthenes upon
the imminent danger we are in from the overgrown power of king Philip.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.494

As becoming as all that public spirit will be, which to be sure will
now come forth, I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} but think we were at least as
happy and as great when all the young Pitts and Lytteltons were pelting
oratory at my father for rolling out a twenty years peace, and not
envying the trophies which he passed by every day in Westminster-hall.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.495

But one must not repine; rather reflect on the glories which they have
drove the nation headlong into.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.496

One must think all our distresses and dangers well laid out, when they
have purchased us Glover's Oration for the merchants, the admiralty for
the duke of Bedford, and the reversion of secretary at war for Pitt,
which he will certainly have, unless the French king should happen to
have the nomination; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,21.497

and then I fear, as much obliged as that court is to my lord Cobham
and his nephews, they would be so partial as to prefer some <P_5,22>
illiterate nephew of cardinal Tencin's, who never heard of Leonidas or
the Hanover troops.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.498

With all these reflections, as I love to make myself easy, especially
politically, I comfort myself with what St. Evremond <paren>
a favourite philosopher of mine, for he thought what he liked, not
liked what he thought <$$paren> said in defence of cardinal Mazarin,
when he was reproached with neglecting the good of the kingdom that he
might engross the riches of it: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.499

"Well, let him get all the riches, and then he will think of the good
of the kingdom, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.500

for it will all be his own. "WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.501

Let the French but have England, and they $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} want to
conquer it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.502

We may possibly contract the French spirit of being supremely content
with the glory of our monarch, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.503

and then - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.504

why then it will be the first time we ever were contented yet.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.505

We hear of nothing but your retiring, and of Dutch treachery:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.506

in short, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} an ugly scene!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.507

I know of no home news but the commencement of the gaming act, for which
they are to put up a scutcheon at White's for the death of play; and the
death of Winnington's wife, which may be an unlucky event for my lady -.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.508

As he has no children, he will certainly marry again;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.509

and who will give him their daughter, unless he breaks off that affair
, which I believe he will now very willingly make a marriage article?
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.510

We want him to take lady Charlotte Fermor.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.511

She was always his beauty, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.512

and has so many charming qualities, that she would make any body happy.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.513

He will make a good husband; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.514

for he is excessively good-natured, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.515

and was much better to that strange wife than he cared to own.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.516

You wondered at my journey to Houghton; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.517

now wonder more, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.518

for I am going to Mount Edgecumbe.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.519

Now my summers are in my own hands, and I am not obliged to pass great
part of them in Norfolk, I find it is not so very terrible to dispose
of them up and down.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.520

In about three weeks I shall set out, and see Wilton and $Doddington
$'s {TEXT:Doddington's} in my way.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,22.521

Dear Harry, do but get a victory, and I will let off every cannon at
Plymouth; reserving two, till I hear particularly that you have killed
two more Frenchmen with <P_5,23> your own hand.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.522

Lady Mary sends you her compliments; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.523

She is going to pass a week with miss Townshend at Muffits;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.524

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think you will be forgot.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.525

Your sister Anne has got a new distemper, which she says feels like
something <font> jumping <$$font> in her.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.526

You know my style on such an occasion, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.527

and may be sure I have not spared this distemper.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.528

Adieu!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.529

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.530

{ED:Letter_XI}

Windsor still, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.532

Oct. 3, 1746.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.533

My dear Harry, You ask me if I am really grown a philosopher.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.534

Really I believe not; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.535

for I shall refer you to my practice rather than to my doctrine,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.536

and have really acquired what they only pretended to seek, content.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.537

So far indeed I was a philosopher even when I lived in town,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.538

for then I was content too; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.539

and all the difference I can conceive between those two opposite
doctors was, that Aristippus loved London, and Diogenes Windsor:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.540

and if your master the duke, whom I sincerely prefer to Alexander,
and who certainly can intercept more sunshine, would but stand out of
my way, which he is extremely in, while he lives in the park here, I
should love my little tub of forty pounds a year, more than my palace
dans la rue des ministres, with all my pictures and bronzes, which
you ridiculously imagine I have encumbered myself with in my solitude.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.541

Solitude it is, as to the tub itself, for no soul lives in it with me ;
though I could easily give you room at the butt end of it, and with vast
pleasure; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.542

but George Montagu, who perhaps is a philosopher too, though I am
sure not of Pythagoras's silent sect, lives but two barrels off;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,23.543

and Ashton, a Christian philosopher of our acquaintance, <P_5,24> lives
at the foot of that hill which you mention with a melancholy satisfaction
that always attends the reflection.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.544

Apropos, here is an ode on the very subject, which I desire you
will please to like excessively: {COM:ode_omitted_in_edition}
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.545

You will immediately conclude, out of good breeding, that it is mine,
and that it is charming.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.546

I shall be much obliged to you for the first thought,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.547

but desire you will retain only the second, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.548

for it is Mr. Gray's, and not Your humble servant's, Hor.
Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.549

{ED:Letter_XII}

Windsor, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.551

October 24, 1746.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.552

Well, Harry, Scotland is the last place on earth I should have thought
of for turning any body poet: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.553

but I begin to forgive it half its treasons in favour of your verses,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.554

for I suppose you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think I am the dupe of the
highland story that you tell me: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.555

the only use I shall make of it is to commend the lines to you, as if
they really were a Scotsman's.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.556

There is a melancholy harmony in them that is charming, and a delicacy in
the thoughts that no Scotchman is capable of, though a <font> Scotchwoman
<$$font> might inspire it.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.557

I beg both for Cynthia's sake and my own that you would continue your
de Tristibus, till I have an opportunity of seeing your muse, and she
of rewarding her: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.558

Reprens ta musette, berger amoureux!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.559

If Cynthia has ever travelled ten miles in fairy land, she must be
wondrous content with the person and qualifications of her knight,
who in future story will be read of thus: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.560

Elmedorus was tall and perfectly well made, his face oval, and features
regularly handsome, but not effeminate; his complexion sentimentally
brown, with not much colour; his teeth fine, and forehead agreeably
low, round which his black hair curled naturally and beautifully.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.561

His eyes were black too, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,24.562

but had nothing of fierce or insolent; on the contrary, a certain
melancholy swimmingness that described hopeless <P_5,25> love, rather
than a natural amorous languish.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.563

His exploits in war, where he always fought by the side of the renowned
Paladine William of England, have endeared his memory to all admirers
of true chivalry, as the mournful elegies which he poured out among the
desert rocks of Caledonia in honour of the peerless lady and his heart's
idol, the incomparable Cynthia, will for ever preserve his name in the
flowery annals of poesy.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.564

What a pity it is I was not born in the golden age of Louis the fourteenth
, when it was not only the fashion to write folios, but to read them too!
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.565

Or rather, it is a pity the same fashion $do $n't {TEXT:don't} {COM:sic}
subsist now, when one need not be at the trouble of invention, nor of
turning the whole Roman history into romance, for want of proper heroes.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.566

Your campaign in Scotland rolled out and well be-epitheted would make
a pompous work, and make one's fortune; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.567

at six-pence a number, one should have all the damsels within the
liberties for subscribers: whereas now, if one has a mind to be read,
one must write metaphysical poems in blank verse, which though I own to
be still easier have not half the imagination of romances, and are dull
without any agreeable absurdity.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.568

Only think of the gravity of this wise age, that have exploded <font>
Cleopatra and Pharamond, <$$font> and approve <font> The Pleasures of the
Imagination, The Art of preserving Health, <$$font> and <font> Leonidas!
<$$font> WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.569

- I beg the age's pardon: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.570

it has done approving these poems, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.571

and has forgot them.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.572

Adieu, dear Harry!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.573

Thank you seriously for the poem.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.574

I am going to town for the birth-day, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.575

and shall return hither till the parliament meets; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.576

I suppose there is no doubt of our meeting then.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.577

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.578

P.S.  Now you are at Stirling, if you should meet with Drummond's History
of the five king Jameses, pray look it over.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.579

I have lately read it, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.580

and like it much.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.581

It is wrote in imitation of Livy, the style masculine, and the whole
very sensible - WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.582

only he ascribes the misfortunes of one reign to the then king's
loving architecture, and"In trim gardens taking pleasure. "
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,25.583

{ED:Letter_XIII}

Arlington-street, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.586

April 16, 1747.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.587

Dear Harry, We are all skyrockets and bonfires to-night for your last
year's victory; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.588

but if you have a mind to perpetuate yourselves in the calendar, you
must take care to refresh your conquests.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.589

I was yesterday out of town, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.590

and the very signs as I passed through the villages made me make
very quaint reflections on the mortality of fame and popularity.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.591

I observed how the duke's head had succeeded almost universally to
admiral Vernon's, as his had left but few traces of the duke of $Ormond
$'s {TEXT:Ormond's}.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.592

I pondered these things in my heart, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.593

and said unto myself, Surely all glory is but as a sign!
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.594

You have heard that old Lovat's tragedy is over: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.595

it has been succeeded by a little farce, containing the humours of the
duke of Newcastle and his man Stone.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.596

The first event was a squabble between his grace and the sheriff about
holding up the head on the scaffold - a custom that has been disused,
and which the sheriff would not comply with, as he received no order
in writing.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.597

Since that the duke has burst ten yards of breeches strings about the
body, which was to be sent into Scotland; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.598

but it seems it is customary for vast numbers to rise to attend the most
trivial burial.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.599

The duke, who is always at least as much frightened at doing right as
at doing wrong, was three days before he got courage enough to order
the burying in the Tower.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.600

I must tell you an excessive good story of George Selwyn:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.601

Some women were scolding him for going to see the execution,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.602

and asked him, how he could be such a barbarian to see the head cut off?
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.603

"Nay,"says he,"if that was such a crime, I am sure I have made amends,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.604

for I went to see it sewed on again. "WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.605

When he was at the undertaker's, as soon as they had stitched him
together, and were going to put the body into the coffin, George,
in my lord chancellor's voice, said,"My lord Lovat, your lordship may
rise. "WALPOLE-174X-1,5,26.606

My lady T- has picked up a little stable-boy in the Tower, <P_5,27> which
the warders have put upon her for a natural son of lord Kilmarnock's,
and taken him into her own house.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.607

You need not tell Mr. T. this from me.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.608

We have had a great and fine day in the house on the second reading
the bill for taking away the heritable jurisdictions in Scotland.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.609

Lyttelton made the finest oration imaginable; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.610

the solicitor general, the new advocate, and Hume Campbell, particularly
the last, spoke excessively well for it, and Oswald against it.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.611

The majority was 233 against 102.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.612

Pitt was not there; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.613

the duchess of Queensberry had ordered him to have the gout.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.614

I will give you a commission once more to tell lord Bury that he has
quite dropped me: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.615

if I thought he would take me up again, I would write to him;
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.616

a message would encourage me.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.617

Adieu!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.618

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.619

{ED:Letter_XIV}

Twickenham, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.621

June 8, 1747.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.622

You perceive by my date that I am got into a new camp, and have left my
tub at Windsor.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.623

It is a little play-thing-house that I got out of Mrs. Chenevix's
shop, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.624

and is the prettiest bawble you ever saw.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.625

It is set in enamelled meadows, with philigree hedges:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.626

A small Euphrates through the piece is roll'd, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.627

And little finches wave their wings in gold.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.628

Two delightful roads, that you would call dusty, supply me continually
with coaches and chaises: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,27.629

barges as solemn as barons of the exchequer move under <P_5,28> my window
; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.630

Richmond-hill and Ham-walks bound my prospect; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.631

but, thank God!  the Thames is between me and the duchess of Queensberry.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.632

Dowagers as plenty as flounders inhabit all around,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.633

and Pope's ghost is just now skimming under my window by a most poetical
moonlight.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.634

I have about land enough to keep such a farm as Noah's, when he set up
in the ark with a pair of each kind; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.635

but my cottage is rather cleaner than I believe his was after they had
been cooped up together forty days.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.636

The Chenevixes had tricked it out for themselves: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.637

up two pair of stairs is what they call Mr. Chenevix's library,
furnished with three maps, one shelf, a bust of sir Isaac Newton, and
a lame telescope without any glasses.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.638

Lord John Sackville <font> predecessed <$$font> me here,
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.639

and instituted certain games called <font> cricketalia, <$$font>
which have been celebrated this very evening in honour of him in a
neighbouring meadow.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.640

You will think I have removed my philosophy from Windsor with my
tea-things hither; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.641

for I am writing to you in all this tranquillity while a parliament is
bursting about my ears.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.642

You know it is going to be dissolved: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.643

I am told, you are taken care of, though I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know
where, nor whether any body that chooses you will quarrel with me because
he does choose you, as that little bug - did; one of the calamities of
my life which I have bore as abominably well as I do most about which
I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.644

They say the prince has taken up two hundred thousand pounds, to carry
elections which he $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} carry: WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.645

- he had much better have saved it to buy the parliament after it
is chosen.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.646

A new set of peers are in embryo, to add more dignity to the silence of
the house of lords.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.647

I make no remarks on your campaign, because, as you say, you do nothing
at all; which, though very proper nutriment for a thinking head, does
not do quite so well to write upon.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.648

If any one of you can but contrive to be shot upon your post, it is all
we desire, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.649

shall look upon it as a great curiosity, WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.650

and will take care to set up a monument to the person so slain, as we
are doing by vote to captain -, who was killed at the beginning of the
action in the Mediterranean four years ago.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.651

In the present dearth of glory, he is canonized, though, poor man!  he had
been tried twice the year before for cowardice.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,28.652

I could tell you much election-news, none else; though not being
thoroughly <P_5,29> attentive to so important a subject, as to be sure
one ought to be, I might now and then mistake, and give you a candidate
for Durham in place of one for Southampton, or name the returning-officer
instead of the candidate.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.653

In general, I believe, it is much as usual - those sold in detail
that afterwards will be sold in the representation - the ministers
bribing jacobites {COM:sic} to choose friends of their own - the name
of well-wishers to the present establishment, and patriots, outbidding
ministers that they may make the better market of their own patriotism:
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.654

- in short, all England, under some name or other, is just now to be
bought and sold; though, whenever we become posterity and forefathers,
we shall be in high repute for wisdom and virtue.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.655

My great great grand-children will figure me with a white beard down to
my girdle; WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.656

and Mr. Pitt's will believe him unspotted enough to have walked
over nine hundred hot ploughshares, without hurting the sole of his foot.
WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.657

How merry my ghost will be, and shake its ears to hear itself quoted a
person of consummate prudence!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.658

- Adieu, dear Harry!  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.659

Yours ever, Hor. Walpole.  WALPOLE-174X-1,5,29.660
