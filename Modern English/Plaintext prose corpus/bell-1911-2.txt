<$$heading>

To travel in the desert is in one respect curiously akin to travelling
on the sea: BELL-1911-2,159.7

it gives you no premonition of the changed environment to which the days
of journeying are conducting you.  BELL-1911-2,159.8

When you set sail from a familiar shore you enter on a course from
which the usual landmarks of daily existence have been swept away.
BELL-1911-2,159.9

What has become of the march of time?  BELL-1911-2,159.10

Dawn leads to noon, noon to sunset, sunset to the night;
BELL-1911-2,159.11

but night breaks into a dawn indistinguishable from the last, the same
sky above, the same sea on every side, the same planks beneath your feet.
BELL-1911-2,159.12

Is it indeed another day?  BELL-1911-2,159.13

or is it yesterday lived over again?  BELL-1911-2,159.14

Then on a sudden you touch the land BELL-1911-2,159.15

and find that that recurring day has carried you round half the globe.
BELL-1911-2,159.16

So it is in the desert.  BELL-1911-2,159.17

You rise BELL-1911-2,159.18

and look out upon the same landscape that greeted you before -
BELL-1911-2,159.19

the contour of the hills may have altered ever so slightly,
BELL-1911-2,159.20

the hollow that holds your camp has deepened by a few yards since last
week, BELL-1911-2,159.21

the limitless sweep of the plain was not hidden a fortnight ago by that
little mound; BELL-1911-2,159.22

but here are the same people about you, speaking of the same things,
BELL-1911-2,159.23

here is the same path to be followed, BELL-1911-2,159.24

yes, even the seasons are the same, BELL-1911-2,159.25

and the dusty face of the desert is too old to flush at the advent
of spring or to be wreathed in autumn garlands of gold and scarlet.
BELL-1911-2,159.26

Yet at the end of a long interval composed of periods recurrent and alike,
you look round BELL-1911-2,159.27

and see that the whole face of the universe has changed.
BELL-1911-2,159.28

When we reached Kerbela` we passed into a world of which the aspect and
the associations were entirely new to me.  BELL-1911-2,159.29

I had set out from an Arab town in North Syria, BELL-1911-2,159.30

and I emerged in a Persian city linked historically with the Holy <P_160>
Places, with the first struggles and the only great schism of Islam.
BELL-1911-2,160.31

At Kerbela` was enacted the tragedy of the death of Hussein, son of
'Ali` ibn abi Ta`lib; BELL-1911-2,160.32

the place has grown up round the mosque that holds his tomb,
BELL-1911-2,160.33

and to one half of those who profess the Mohammadan creed it is a goal
no less sacred than Mecca.  BELL-1911-2,160.34

But it was not the golden dome of Hussein, though it covers the richest
treasure of offerings possessed by any known shrine <paren> unless the
treasure in'Ali's tomb of Nejef touch a yet higher value <$$paren>
, nor yet the presence of the green-robed Persians, narrow of soul,
austere and stern of countenance - BELL-1911-2,160.35

it was not the wealth and fame of the Shi`ah sanctuary that made the
strongest assault upon the imagination.  BELL-1911-2,160.36

It was the sense of having reached those regions which saw the founding
of imperial Isla`m, regions which remained for many centuries the seat
of the paramount ruler, the Commander of the Faithful.  BELL-1911-2,160.37

Within the compass of a two-days'journey lay the battlefield of
Ka`disi`yah, where Kha`lid ibn u'l Wal`id overthrew at once and for ever
the Sassanian power.  BELL-1911-2,160.38

Chosroes with his hosts, his satraps, his Arab allies - those princes
of the house of Mundhi`r whose capital was one of the first cradles
of Arab culture - stepped back at his coming into the shadowy past;
BELL-1911-2,160.39

their cities and palaces faded and disappeared, Hi`rah, Khawarnak,
Ctesiphon, and many another of which the very site is forgotten;
BELL-1911-2,160.40

all the pomp and valour of an earlier time fell together like an army
of dreams at the first trumpet-blast of those armies of the Faith which
hold the field until this hour.  BELL-1911-2,160.41

Then came the day of vigour; the adding of dominion to dominion; the
building of great Mohammadan towns, Ku`fah, Wa`sit, Basrah, and last
of all Baghda`d, last and greatest.  And then decline, and finally the
transference of authority.  BELL-1911-2,160.42

This was the story that was unfolded before me as I stood upon the roof
of a Persian house and gazed down into the gorgeously tiled courtyard
of the mosque of Hussein, in which none but the Faithful may set foot.
BELL-1911-2,160.43

When I lifted my eyes and looked westward I saw the desert across which
the soldiers of the Prophet had come to batter down the old civilizations
; BELL-1911-2,160.44

when I looked east I saw the road to Baghda`d, where their descendants
had cultivated <P_161> with no less renown, the arts of peace.
BELL-1911-2,161.45

The low sun shone upon the golden dome; BELL-1911-2,161.46

the nesting storks held conversation from minaret to minaret, with much
clapping of beaks and shaking out of unruffled wings; BELL-1911-2,161.47

the Spirit of Islam marched out of the wilderness BELL-1911-2,161.48

and seized the fruitful earth.  BELL-1911-2,161.49

There were other lesser things which aroused a more personal if not a
keener interest.  BELL-1911-2,161.50

The oranges were good at Kerbela`, as Fattu`h had said.
BELL-1911-2,161.51

The shops were heaped with them and with pale sweet lemons:
BELL-1911-2,161.52

I fear I must have astonished my military escort, BELL-1911-2,161.53

for I stopped at every corner to buy more and yet more, BELL-1911-2,161.54

and ate them as I went along the streets, hoping to satisfy the
inextinguishable thirst born of the desert.  BELL-1911-2,161.55

Side by side with the oranges lay mountains of pink roses, the flowers
cut off short and piled together; BELL-1911-2,161.56

every one in the town carried a handful of them BELL-1911-2,161.57

and sniffed at them as he walked.  BELL-1911-2,161.58

After night had fallen I was invited to a bountiful Persian dinner,
where we feasted on lamb stuffed with pistachios, and drank sherbet out
of deep wooden spoons.  BELL-1911-2,161.59

And there I heard some talk of politics.  BELL-1911-2,161.60

Under the best of circumstances, said one of my informants, constitutional
government was not likely to be popular in the province of 'Ira`k.
BELL-1911-2,161.61

Men of property were all reactionary at heart.  BELL-1911-2,161.62

They had got together their wealth by force and oppression;
BELL-1911-2,161.63

their title-deeds would not bear critical examination, BELL-1911-2,161.64

and they resented the curiosity and the comments of the newly-fledged
local press.  BELL-1911-2,161.65

Nor were the majority of the officials better inclined -
BELL-1911-2,161.66

how was it possible?  BELL-1911-2,161.67

To forbid corruption, unless the order were accompanied by a rise in
salary corresponding to the perquisites of which they were deprived
<paren> and this was forbidden by the state of the imperial exchequer
<$$paren> meant for them starvation.  BELL-1911-2,161.68

A judge, for example, is appointed for two and a half years
BELL-1911-2,161.69

and his salary is +LT15 a month, not enough to keep himself and his family
in circumstances which would accord with his position.  BELL-1911-2,161.70

But over and above the expenses of living he must see to the provision
of a sum sufficient to engage the sympathies of his superiors when his
appointment shall have expired; BELL-1911-2,161.71

otherwise he might abandon the hope of further employment.
BELL-1911-2,161.72

Most probably he would <P_162> have to defray the heavy charges of a
journey to Constantinople, to enable him to push his claim, not to speak
of the fact that he might spend several unsalaried months in the capital
before his request was granted.  BELL-1911-2,162.73

"And so it is that out of ten men, eleven take bribes, and, as far
as we can see, nothing has come of the constitution but the black fez
"<paren> this because of the boycott on the red fez, made in Austria
<$$paren>,"free speech and two towers, one at Kerbela` and one at Nejef,
to commemorate the age of liberty. "BELL-1911-2,162.74

Under the new regime Kerbela` had received a mutesarrif whose story was
a good example of the mistakes which men were apt to commit when first
the old restraints were relaxed.  BELL-1911-2,162.75

He was of the Ahrar, the Liberals, BELL-1911-2,162.76

and had begun his career as secretary to the Va`li` of Baghda`d.
BELL-1911-2,162.77

The people of Baghda`d raised a complaint against him, on the ground
that in the fast month of Ramadan he had been seen to smoke a cigarette
in the bazaar between sunrise and sunset, which showed clearly that he
was an infidel, BELL-1911-2,162.78

and he was dismissed from his post; BELL-1911-2,162.79

but since he was one of the Ahra`r and had friends in Constantinople,
he was presently appointed to Kerbela`.  BELL-1911-2,162.80

Now Kerbela`, being a holy place inhabited mostly by Persian Shi'ahs, is
one of the most fanatical cities in the Ottoman Empire, BELL-1911-2,162.81

and a mutesarrif who brought with him so unfortunate a reputation could
do nothing that was right.  BELL-1911-2,162.82

Some of his reforms were in themselves reasonable, BELL-1911-2,162.83

but he was not the man to initiate them, BELL-1911-2,162.84

nor was Kerbela` the best field for experiments.  BELL-1911-2,162.85

The town, owing to blind extortion on the part of the government
and to neglect of the irrigation system, is growing rapidly poorer
BELL-1911-2,162.86

and yields an ever diminishing revenue.  BELL-1911-2,162.87

This revenue is burdened by a number of pensions, BELL-1911-2,162.88

and the mutesarrif, looking for a way of retrenchment, found it by
depriving all pensioners of their means of livelihood.  BELL-1911-2,162.89

The pensioners were holy men, sayyids, whose duty it was to pray for
the welfare of the Sultan.  BELL-1911-2,162.90

Some were old BELL-1911-2,162.91

and some were deserving, BELL-1911-2,162.92

some were neither, BELL-1911-2,162.93

but all were holy, BELL-1911-2,162.94

and the feelings that were aroused in Kerbela` when they were left
destitute baffle description.  BELL-1911-2,162.95

"Yet,"continued my host,"the Turks understand government.
BELL-1911-2,162.96

<P_163>

There was once in Basrah an excellent governor; BELL-1911-2,163.98

his name was Hamdi` Bey.  BELL-1911-2,163.99

When he came to Basrah it was the worst city in Turkey;
BELL-1911-2,163.100

every night there were murders, BELL-1911-2,163.101

and no one dared to leave his house after dark lest when he returned
he should find that he had been robbed of all he possessed. "
BELL-1911-2,163.102

"So it is now in Basrah,"said I, BELL-1911-2,163.103

for the town is a by-word in Mesopotamia.  BELL-1911-2,163.104

"Yes, so it is now,"he returned, BELL-1911-2,163.105

"but it was different when Hamdi` Bey was governor.  BELL-1911-2,163.106

For a year he sat quiet BELL-1911-2,163.107

and collected information concerning all the villains in the place;
BELL-1911-2,163.108

but he did nothing.  BELL-1911-2,163.109

Now there was at that time a harmless madman in Basrah whom the people
called Hajji` Beida`, the White Pilgrim; BELL-1911-2,163.110

and when they saw Hamdi` Bey driving through the streets, they would point
at him and laugh, saying:'There goes Hajji` Beida`.  'BELL-1911-2,163.111

But at the end of a year he assembled all the chief men
BELL-1911-2,163.112

and said:'Hitherto you have called me Hajji` Beida`; BELL-1911-2,163.113

now you shall call me Hajji` Kara, the Black Pilgrim. '
BELL-1911-2,163.114

And then and there he cast most of them into prison BELL-1911-2,163.115

and produced his evidence against them.  BELL-1911-2,163.116

And after a year's time the town was so peaceful that he ordered the
citizens to leave their doors open at night; BELL-1911-2,163.117

and as long as Hamdi` Bey remained at Basrah no man troubled to lock
his door.  BELL-1911-2,163.118

And at another time there was a Commandant in Basrah, BELL-1911-2,163.119

and he too brought the place to order.  BELL-1911-2,163.120

For when he knew a prisoner to be guilty, yet failed to get the
witnesses to speak against him, he would put the man to death in prison
by means of a hot iron which he drove into his stomach through a tube.
BELL-1911-2,163.121

Then it was given out that the man had died of an illness,
BELL-1911-2,163.122

and every one rejoiced that there should be a rogue the less. "
BELL-1911-2,163.123

I made no comment, BELL-1911-2,163.124

but my expression must have betrayed me, BELL-1911-2,163.125

for my interlocutor added a justification of the commandant's methods.
BELL-1911-2,163.126

"In Persia,"said he,"they bury them alive. "BELL-1911-2,163.127

"My soldiers have told me,"said I, not to be outdone,"that in Persia
they cut off a thief's hand, BELL-1911-2,163.128

and I think they regard it as the proper sentence, BELL-1911-2,163.129

for they generally add:'That is hukm, justice. '" BELL-1911-2,163.130

<P_164>

"It is the sheri`'ah,"he replied simply,"the holy law,"
BELL-1911-2,164.132

and he recited the passage from the Kuran: BELL-1911-2,164.133

"If a man or woman steal, cut off their hands in retribution for that
which they have done; BELL-1911-2,164.134

this is an exemplary punishment appointed by God, BELL-1911-2,164.135

and God is mighty and wise. "BELL-1911-2,164.136

I had intended to go straight from Kerbela` to Babylon,
BELL-1911-2,164.137

but I was reckoning without full knowledge of the Hindi`yeh swamp.
BELL-1911-2,164.138

The history of this swamp is both curious and instructive.
BELL-1911-2,164.139

A few miles above the village of Museiyib, north-east of Kerbela`,
the Euphrates divides into two channels.  BELL-1911-2,164.140

The eastern channel, the true bed of the river, runs past Babylon and
Hilleh BELL-1911-2,164.141

and discharges its waters into the great swamp which has existed
in southern'Irak ever since the last days of the Sassanian kings.
BELL-1911-2,164.142

The western channel is known as the Nahr Hindi`yeh; BELL-1911-2,164.143

it waters Ku`fah, now a miserable hamlet clustered about the great mosque
in which the khalif'Ali` was assassinated, BELL-1911-2,164.144

and flowing through the great swamp re-enters the Euphrates some way
above the junction of the latter with the Tigris.  BELL-1911-2,164.145

The dam on the Euphrates which regulated the flowing of its waters
into the Hindi`yeh canal has been allowed to fall into disrepair;
BELL-1911-2,164.146

every year a deeper and a stronger stream flows down the Hindi`yeh,
BELL-1911-2,164.147

and matters have reached such a pass that during the season of low water
the eastern bed is dry, the palm gardens of Hilleh are dying for lack
of irrigation, and all the country along the river-bank below Hilleh
has gone out of cultivation.  BELL-1911-2,164.148

The growth of the Hindi`yeh has proved scarcely less disastrous.
BELL-1911-2,164.149

<P_165>

The district to the west of the canal, in which Kerbela` lies, is lower
than the level of the stream, while the increasing torrents, bringing with
them the silt of the spring floods, yearly raise the bed of the canal and
add to the difficulty of keeping it within bounds.  BELL-1911-2,165.151

The Hindi`yeh has become an ever-present danger to the town of Kerbela`
, BELL-1911-2,165.152

and indeed in one year, when the stream was unusually high, the water
flowed into the streets.  BELL-1911-2,165.153

It was the duty of the owners of the land, a duty prescribed by immemorial
custom, to keep up the dykes, in order to save the cultivated country,
and incidentally the town, from inundation.  BELL-1911-2,165.154

Needless to say they neglected to do so.  BELL-1911-2,165.155

A large part of the land - and here the story takes a very Oriental
turn - had been bought up by a rich Mohammadan who proposed to do a good
office by the holy city and to take the charge of the dykes upon himself.
BELL-1911-2,165.156

But as the canal silted up the charge became heavier, until at last the
pious benefactor wearied of his task and refused to do another hand's
turn in the matter.  BELL-1911-2,165.157

Thereupon the mutesarrif sent for him BELL-1911-2,165.158

and ordered him to perform his lawful duty.  BELL-1911-2,165.159

But the landowner was an Indian and a British subject BELL-1911-2,165.160

<paren> at this point I realized that I had come once more into the net
of our vast empire <$$paren> BELL-1911-2,165.161

and he refused to be bullied by a Turkish official.  BELL-1911-2,165.162

He pointed out that the floods were largely due to the negligence of
the Arab tribes, who draw from the Hindi`yeh ten times as much water as
they need and let it go to waste upon the land, where it helps to form
the redoubted swamp; BELL-1911-2,165.163

and since, said he, the swamp was caused not by the will of God, but
by the conduct of the Sultan's subjects, the government would do well
to remedy the evil by applying to the dykes the forced labour which
it has the right to exact from every man during four days in the year.
BELL-1911-2,165.164

The mutesarrif replied that the Indian had not cultivated his land
for four years and that it was therefore forfeit to the State;
BELL-1911-2,165.165

the Indian countered him with the rejoinder that the land had been under
pasture and had paid a regular tithe.  BELL-1911-2,165.166

So the matter stood in the <P_166> spring of 1909; BELL-1911-2,166.167

the town of Kerbela` might at any time be flooded if the river rose,
BELL-1911-2,166.168

the Hindi`yeh swamp was growing day by day, BELL-1911-2,166.169

and the road to Babylon was impassable.  BELL-1911-2,166.170

No one seemed to regard these perils and inconveniences as otherwise
than inevitable, BELL-1911-2,166.171

and I with the rest bowed my head to the inscrutable decrees of God
BELL-1911-2,166.172

and took my way to Museiyib.  BELL-1911-2,166.173

Museiyib, as I have said, lies on the Euphrates above the point where
the Hindi`yeh canal branches off from the river.  BELL-1911-2,166.174

For the last half of the day's journey we skirted the swamp.
BELL-1911-2,166.175

It was in reality much more than a swamp: BELL-1911-2,166.176

it was a shallow lake extending over a vast area.  BELL-1911-2,166.177

It had invaded even the Museiyib road, which is the direct road from
Kerbela` to Baghda`d, BELL-1911-2,166.178

and we, together with all other travellers, had to make a long de`tour
through the desert.  BELL-1911-2,166.179

The other travellers were mainly Persian pilgrims, men, women and children
riding on mules in panniers.  BELL-1911-2,166.180

It is the ardent wish of every pious Persian to make the pilgrimage to
Kerbela` once during his lifetime, BELL-1911-2,166.181

and still more does he desire to make it once again after his death, that
his body may lie in earth hallowed by the vicinity of Hussein's grave.
BELL-1911-2,166.182

Countless caravans of corpses journey yearly from Persia to Kerbela`
, BELL-1911-2,166.183

and the living should bear in mind that the kha`ns of the towns are
insalubrious, to say the least, owing to the fact that they are packed
with dead bodies awaiting their final burial.  BELL-1911-2,166.184

The close connection between Kerbela` and Persia has been during recent
years of considerable political significance.  BELL-1911-2,166.185

The large Persian community, rich, influential and safely placed under the
protection of the Turkish government, has more than once tendered advice
to the struggling factions of its native country, BELL-1911-2,166.186

and more than once the advice has been in the nature of a command.
BELL-1911-2,166.187

The European is not accustomed to think of the Ottoman Empire as a haven
of refuge for the oppressed, BELL-1911-2,166.188

but the Persian, comparing Turkish administration with his own,
regards it as an unattainable standard of tranquillity and equity.
BELL-1911-2,166.189

Turkey must be judged by Asiatic, not by European, possibilities of
achievement, BELL-1911-2,166.190

and I tried to keep my thoughts fixed upon the pilgrims jogging sadly
home to <P_167> their intolerable anarchy; BELL-1911-2,167.191

but it was difficult not to notice the bands of peasants who came
wading through the shallow waters of the Hindi`yeh floods, their fields
submerged, their crops devastated, their houses reduced to mud-heaps
and their possessions scattered over the swamp.  BELL-1911-2,167.192

Six hours from Kerbela` we reached the Euphrates, a river much smaller
than the one we had left at Hi`t, since a great part of its waters had
been drawn off into irrigation canals.  BELL-1911-2,167.193

To my amazement it was provided with a practicable bridge of boats,
by which we crossed, glorifying the works of man.  BELL-1911-2,167.194

It was the first, and I may add the only bridge over the Euphrates that
I was privileged to see.  BELL-1911-2,167.195

We pitched camp on the further side just beyond the village of Museiyib.
BELL-1911-2,167.196

On the following day we turned southwards to Babylon.  BELL-1911-2,167.197

For two hours we continued to do battle with the waters, not, however,
with untamed floods, but with the almost equally obtrusive irrigation
canals and runnels which the industrious fellah conducts in all directions
across his fields, regardless of road and path and of the time and temper
of the wayfarer.  BELL-1911-2,167.198

At length we reached the high road from Baghda`d to Hilleh, beyond the
belt of cultivation, BELL-1911-2,167.199

and made the rest of the stage dry-footed.  BELL-1911-2,167.200

We crossed the Nasri`yeh canal by a bridge near a ruined kha`n,
BELL-1911-2,167.201

and five hours from Museiyib we came to the village of Mahawi`l on a
canal of the same name, also bridged.  BELL-1911-2,167.202

There I lunched under palm-trees - BELL-1911-2,167.203

there are no other trees in these regions - BELL-1911-2,167.204

and so rode on, catching up the caravan and crossing many another
canal, now dry, now bringing water to villages far to the east of us.
BELL-1911-2,167.205

It was a very barren world, scarred with the traces of former cultivation
, and all the more poverty-stricken and desolate because it had once
been rich and peopled; flat, too, an interminable, featureless expanse
from which the glory had departed.  BELL-1911-2,167.206

I was almost immersed in the rather jejune reflections which must assail
every one who approaches Babylon, when, as good-luck would have it,
I turned my eyes to the south and perceived, on the edge of the arid,
sun-drenched plain, a mighty mound.  BELL-1911-2,167.207

There was no need to ask its name; BELL-1911-2,167.208

as certainly as if temple and fortress wall still crowned its summit
I knew it to be <P_168> Ba`bil, the northern mound that retains on the
lips of the Arabs the echo of its ancient title.  BELL-1911-2,168.209

I left the road, hoping to find a direct path across the plain to that
great vestige of ancient splendours, BELL-1911-2,168.210

but the deep cutting of a water-course, as dry and dead as Babylon itself,
barred the way.  BELL-1911-2,168.211

My mare climbed to the top of the high bank that edged it
BELL-1911-2,168.212

and we stood gazing over the site of the city.  BELL-1911-2,168.213

A furtive jackal crept out along the bank, BELL-1911-2,168.214

caught sight of Fattu`h BELL-1911-2,168.215

and fled back into the dry ditch.  BELL-1911-2,168.216

"The son of retreat,"said Fattu`h in the speech of the people.
BELL-1911-2,168.217

"Chaka`l,"said I, searching dimly for some familiar swell of sonorous
phrases which the word seemed to bring with it.  BELL-1911-2,168.218

And suddenly they rolled out over the formless thought:
BELL-1911-2,168.219

"The wolves howl in their palaces and the jackals in the pleasant
places. "BELL-1911-2,168.220

For the past twelve years a little group of German excavators has lived
and worked among the mounds of Babylon.  BELL-1911-2,168.221

To them I went, in full assurance of the hospitality which they extend
to all comers.  BELL-1911-2,168.222

The traveller who enters their house, sheltered by palm-trees,
on the banks of the Euphrates, will find it stored with the best
fruits of civilization: studious activity, hard-won learning and that
open-handed kindness which abolishes distinctions of race and country.
BELL-1911-2,168.223

As he watches the daily task of men who are recovering the long-buried
history of the past, he will not know how to divide his admiration
between the almost incredible labour entailed by their researches and the
marvellous culture which their work has laid bare.  BELL-1911-2,168.224

"Only to the wise is wisdom given, and knowledge to them that have
understanding. "BELL-1911-2,168.225

Within the largest of the mounds, the Kasr, or castle, as the Arabs call
it, lie the remains of Nebuchadnezzar's palace.  BELL-1911-2,168.226

Another eight or ten years'work will be needed to complete the ground
plan of the whole structure, BELL-1911-2,168.227

but enough has been done to show the nature of the house wherein the
king rested.  BELL-1911-2,168.228

It is built of square tiles, stamped with his name and bound together
with asphalt.  BELL-1911-2,168.229

The part which has been excavated consists of an immense irregular area
enclosed by thick walls.  BELL-1911-2,168.230

<P_169>

One of these <paren> it forms the quay of a canal <$$paren> is called
by the workmen"the father of twenty-two,"<font> i.e.  <$$font> it is
twenty-two metres across; BELL-1911-2,169.232

another reaches the respectable width of seventeen metres,
BELL-1911-2,169.233

but usually the royal builder was content with five or six metres,
or even less.  BELL-1911-2,169.234

Within the enclosure lies a bewildering complexity of small courts and
passages with chambers leading out of them - the more bewildering because
in many cases the bricks have disappeared, and the walls must be traced
by means of the spaces left behind.  BELL-1911-2,169.235

For more than a thousand years after the fall of Babylon no man
building in its neighbourhood was at the pains to construct brick-kilns,
BELL-1911-2,169.236

but when he needed material he sought it in Nebuchadnezzar's city.
BELL-1911-2,169.237

Greek, Persian and Arab used it as a quarry, BELL-1911-2,169.238

and as you climb the stairs of the German house you will become aware
of the characters that spell the king's name upon the steps beneath
your feet.  BELL-1911-2,169.239

The small courts and chambers, which were no doubt occupied by retinues
of officials and servants of the palace, formed a bulwark of defence
for the king.  BELL-1911-2,169.240

His apartments lay behind a wide paved court.  BELL-1911-2,169.241

From the court a doorway leads into a large oblong chamber, in the back
wall of which is a niche for the throne.  BELL-1911-2,169.242

This is believed to be the banqueting hall where Belshazzar made his
feast, BELL-1911-2,169.243

and on a fragment of wall facing the throne you may see, if you
please, the fingers of a man's hand writing the fatal message.
BELL-1911-2,169.244

How this hall was roofed is an unsolved problem.  BELL-1911-2,169.245

No traces of vaulting have been found, BELL-1911-2,169.246

yet the width from wall to wall is so great that it is doubtful whether
it could have been covered by a roof of beams.  BELL-1911-2,169.247

If there were indeed a vault it would be the earliest example of such
construction on so big a scale.  BELL-1911-2,169.248

Behind the banqueting hall are the private chambers, and behind all a
narrow passage leading to an emergency exit, by means of which the king
could escape to his boat on the Euphrates in the last extremity of danger.
BELL-1911-2,169.249

Nebuchadnezzar's father, Nabopolassar, had built himself a smaller,
but still very considerable, dwelling which occupied the western side
of the mound.  BELL-1911-2,169.250

This Nebuchadnezzar destroyed; BELL-1911-2,169.251

he filled up the walls and chambers with rubble <P_170> and masonry
BELL-1911-2,170.252

and laid out an extension of his own palace above it.  BELL-1911-2,170.253

The plan both of the upper and of the lower palace has now been
ascertained.  BELL-1911-2,170.254

Above the Babylonian walls are the remains of Greek and Parthian
settlements, each of which has to be carefully planned before it can be
swept away and the lower strata studied.  BELL-1911-2,170.255

I saw work being carried on in a mound which formed one of the most
ancient parts of the city; BELL-1911-2,170.256

the excavation pits had been sunk twelve or fifteen metres deep to
dwelling-houses of the first Babylonian Empire.  BELL-1911-2,170.257

They passed through the periods of the Parthian and of the Greek, through
the age of Nebuchadnezzar and that of the Assyrians, BELL-1911-2,170.258

and each stratum was levelled and planned before the next could be
revealed.  BELL-1911-2,170.259

Add to this that the most ancient walls were constructed of sun-dried
brick, scarcely distinguishable from the closely-packed earth,
BELL-1911-2,170.260

and some idea can be obtained of the extreme difficulty of the work.
BELL-1911-2,170.261

The oldest Babylonian houses which have been uncovered rest themselves
on rubbish-heaps and ruins, BELL-1911-2,170.262

but deeper digging is impossible owing to the fact that water-level has
been reached.  BELL-1911-2,170.263

The Euphrates channel has silted up several metres during the last six
thousand years BELL-1911-2,170.264

and the primaeval dwellings are now below it.  BELL-1911-2,170.265

While we were standing at the bottom of a deep pit, a workman struck out
with his pick a little heap of ornaments, a couple of copper bracelets
and the beads of a necklace which had been worn by some Babylonian woman
in the third millennium before Christ and were restored at last to the
light of the sun.  BELL-1911-2,170.266

The northern part of the palace mound is as yet almost untouched.
BELL-1911-2,170.267

Here can be seen a sculptured block which used to lie among the
earth-heaps until a French engineer built a pedestal for it and set it
up above the ruins <paren> Fig. 104 <$$paren>.  BELL-1911-2,170.268

It is carved in the shape of a colossal lion standing above the body of
a man who lies with arms uplifted.  BELL-1911-2,170.269

The man's head is broken away BELL-1911-2,170.270

and the whole group is only half finished, BELL-1911-2,170.271

but the huge beast with the helpless human figure beneath his feet could
not have been given an aspect more sinister.  BELL-1911-2,170.272

It is as though the workmen of the Great King had fashioned an image of
Destiny, treading relentlessly over the generations <P_171> of mankind,
before they too passed into its clutches.  BELL-1911-2,171.273

All along the east side of the palace stretches the Via Sacra, contracting
at one point only its splendid width that it may pass through the gate
that stands midway between the house of Nebuchadnezzar and the temple
of the goddess Ishtar.  BELL-1911-2,171.274

The Ishtar gate - its name is attested by a cuneiform inscription -
is the most magnificent fragment that remains of all Nebuchadnezzar's
constructions.  BELL-1911-2,171.275

Four or five times did he fill up the Via Sacra and raise its level,
BELL-1911-2,171.276

and each time he built up the brick towers of the double gateway to
correspond.  BELL-1911-2,171.277

The various levels of the pavements can now be seen on the sides
of the excavation trench, while the towers, completely disclosed,
rear their unbroken height in stupendous masses of solid masonry.
BELL-1911-2,171.278

They are decorated on every side with alternate rows of bulls and dragons
cast in relief on the brick; BELL-1911-2,171.279

the noble strength of the bulls, stepping out firmly with arched
neck, contrasts with the slender ferocious grace of the dragons,
BELL-1911-2,171.280

and the two companies form a bodyguard worthy of the gate of kings and
of gods <paren> Figs. 105 and 106 <$$paren>.  BELL-1911-2,171.281

Along the walls of the Via Sacra marched a procession of lions, fragments
of which have been found and pieced together.  BELL-1911-2,171.282

They, too, were in relief, but covered with a fine enamel in which the
colours were laid side by side without the intermission of cloissons.
BELL-1911-2,171.283

This art of enamelling is lost, BELL-1911-2,171.284

and no modern workman has been able to imitate the lion frieze.
BELL-1911-2,171.285

On the east side of the gate stands the little temple of Ishtar raised
on a high platform and commanding the city below.  BELL-1911-2,171.286

The temple is built of sun-baked brick, probably in accordance with
hieratic tradition, which held to the ancient building material used
in an age when the architects were unacquainted with the finer and more
durable burnt brick.  BELL-1911-2,171.287

Small courts with side chambers lead into an inner holy of holies , where
in a niche stood the symbol or effigy of the goddess.  BELL-1911-2,171.288

Behind the sanctuary there is a narrow blind passage where the priests
could lurk behind the cult image and confound the common folk with
mysterious sounds and hidden voices.  BELL-1911-2,171.289

The Via Sacra pursues from the gate its stately way, skirting along
the edge of an immense open court <P_172> that lay between the palace
and the temple of the god Marduk, the patron divinity of Babylon.
BELL-1911-2,172.290

The mound in which the temple lies has not as yet been completely
excavated, BELL-1911-2,172.291

but a pit sunk in its centre has laid bare the walls of the entrance
court.  BELL-1911-2,172.292

It will be no easy matter to continue the work here.  BELL-1911-2,172.293

The mound was thickly inhabited during the Greek and Parthian periods,
BELL-1911-2,172.294

and its upper levels consist chiefly of refuse-heaps.  BELL-1911-2,172.295

When the workmen cut down through them to reach the temple gate, the
stench of the old rubbish-heaps, combined with the stifling heat of the
pit, was so intolerable that their labours had to be interrupted for
several days until a breeze arose and made it possible to continue them.
BELL-1911-2,172.296

The excavations are carried on all through the summer heats,
BELL-1911-2,172.297

but the director, Professor Koldewey, was at the time of my visit paying
a penalty for his tireless energy.  BELL-1911-2,172.298

He had been ill for some months owing to his exertions during the previous
summer, BELL-1911-2,172.299

and to my permanent loss I was unable to see him.  BELL-1911-2,172.300

I retain notwithstanding the most delightful memory of the days at
Babylon, of the peace and the dignified simplicity of life in the house
by the river, of the little garden in the courtyard where Badri Bey,
the delegate from the Constantinople museum, coaxed his roses into
flower and his radishes into red and succulent root; of long and pleasant
conversations with Mr. Buddensieg and Mr. Wetzel, wherein
they poured out for me their knowledge of the forgotten things of the
past; of quiet hours with books which they brought for me out of their
library - BELL-1911-2,172.301

and books were a luxury from which I had been cut off since I left Aleppo.
BELL-1911-2,172.302

When I rode out of an afternoon one of the zaptiehs of Babylon was
detailed to accompany me.  BELL-1911-2,172.303

He knew the ruin-field well, having been the fortunate occupier of a
post at the Expeditionshaus for several years.  BELL-1911-2,172.304

I would find him waiting in the palm-grove where my horses were stabled
, alert, respectful and less ragged than his brothers in arms whose
pay does not come to them through the hands of European excavators.
BELL-1911-2,172.305

One day I asked him to take me to the Greek theatre, wondering a little
whether he would understand the request.  BELL-1911-2,172.306

"Effendim,"he said,"you mean the place of Alexander. " BELL-1911-2,172.307

<P_173>

The great name fell strangely among the palm-trees, BELL-1911-2,173.309

and from out of the horde of ghosts that people Babylon strode the
Conqueror at the end of his course.  BELL-1911-2,173.310

So we rode to the place of Alexander, the theatre near the city wall
, ruined almost beyond recognition, but preserving in the popular
nomenclature the memory of the most brilliant figure in the history of
the world.  BELL-1911-2,173.311

And once the clouds gathered as we were riding through the palm-groves
by the river.  BELL-1911-2,173.312

"Praise God! "said the zaptieh, BELL-1911-2,173.313

"maybe we shall have rain. "BELL-1911-2,173.314

He shouted the good tidings to a peasant who drove the oxen of a
water-wheel: BELL-1911-2,173.315

"Oh brother, rain, please God! "BELL-1911-2,173.316

But it was dust that was heralded by the darkness, BELL-1911-2,173.317

and as we hastened to the great mound of Ba`bil the wind bore down upon
us BELL-1911-2,173.318

and the parched earth rose BELL-1911-2,173.319

and enveloped us.  BELL-1911-2,173.320

We left our horses standing with downcast heads under the lee of the
mound BELL-1911-2,173.321

and picked our way up the sides between the trial trenches of the
excavators.  BELL-1911-2,173.322

In a few moments the dust-storm swept past, BELL-1911-2,173.323

and we saw the wide expanse that was Babylon, embraced by gleaming reaches
of river and the circuit of mound and ditch which marks the line of the
city wall.  BELL-1911-2,173.324

"Effendim,"said the zaptieh,"yonder is Birs Nimru`d," BELL-1911-2,173.325

and he pointed to the south-west, where, in the heart of the desert, rose
the huge outline of a temple pyramid, a zigurrat.  BELL-1911-2,173.326

Legend has given it a notable place in the story of our first forefathers
: BELL-1911-2,173.327

it was believed to be no other than the impious tower that witnessed
the confusion of speech.  BELL-1911-2,173.328

I heard at Babylon some hint of the state of unrest, bordering
on revolution, into which the province of'Irak had fallen.
BELL-1911-2,173.329

The German excavators had been sucked into the outer edges of the
whirlpool.  BELL-1911-2,173.330

Their workpeople, drawn from different tribes <paren> they had
relinquished nomad life, but the tribal system still held good among
them <$$paren>, had caught the infection of hatred and turned from the
excavation pits to the settling of ancient scores - so effectually that
many a score had been settled for ever, and the debtor came back to his
place in the trench no more.  BELL-1911-2,173.331

Most of the survivors had been clapped into gaol by a justly incensed
civil authority, BELL-1911-2,173.332

and what with death and the <P_174> serving out of sentences, Professor
Koldewey and his colleagues had suffered from a scarcity of labour.
BELL-1911-2,174.333

This was nothing, as I was to learn at Baghda`d, to the confusion that
reigned in other parts of'Irak, BELL-1911-2,174.334

and it was fortunate that I had no intention of going south from Babylon
; BELL-1911-2,174.335

at that time it would have been impossible.  BELL-1911-2,174.336

On the way to Baghda`d I was resolved to visit Ctesiphon,
BELL-1911-2,174.337

but we were obliged to follow, during the first day's journey, the
Baghda`d road, re-traversing for some hours the line of our march from
Museiyib.  BELL-1911-2,174.338

Ever since we had left Kebeisah the temperature had been exceedingly
high, BELL-1911-2,174.339

and from Babylon to Baghda`d we travelled through a heat wave very
unusual at the beginning of April.  BELL-1911-2,174.340

The early morning was cool and pleasant, BELL-1911-2,174.341

but by about ten o'clock the scorching sun became almost unbearable
, even for people so well inured to heat as my servants and I.
BELL-1911-2,174.342

As long as we were moving, it was tempered by the breath of our progress
, BELL-1911-2,174.343

but if we stood still it burnt through our clothes like a flame.
BELL-1911-2,174.344

There was not a leaf or any green thing upon the plain,
BELL-1911-2,174.345

and the only diversion in a monotonous ride was caused by a peasant
who caught us up with lamentations and laid hold of my stirrup.
BELL-1911-2,174.346

"Effendim! "he cried,"you have soldiers with you; BELL-1911-2,174.347

bid them do justice on the man who stole my cow. "BELL-1911-2,174.348

"Where is the man? "said I in bewilderment.  BELL-1911-2,174.349

"He is here,"he answered, weeping more loudly than before," but a quarter
of an hour back upon the road.  BELL-1911-2,174.350

An Arab he is; BELL-1911-2,174.351

and while I was driving my cow to Museiyib, he came out of the waste
BELL-1911-2,174.352

and took her from me, threatening me with his rifle. " BELL-1911-2,174.353

"The effendi has nought to do with your cow,"said one of the zaptiehs
impatiently - BELL-1911-2,174.354

and indeed the sun withered us as we stood.  BELL-1911-2,174.355

"Go tell the Ka`di` at Museiyib. "BELL-1911-2,174.356

"How shall I get justice from the Ka`di`? "wailed the peasant.
BELL-1911-2,174.357

"I have no money. "BELL-1911-2,174.358

The rejoinder struck me as correct, BELL-1911-2,174.359

and I sent one of the zaptiehs back with the lawful owner of the cow,
telling him to catch the thief if he were still upon the road and I
would give a reward.  BELL-1911-2,174.360

The zaptieh re-joined us while we were lunching <P_175> at the kha`n of
Hasua, BELL-1911-2,175.361

but he had not seen the cow, nor yet the thief, BELL-1911-2,175.362

and perhaps it was unreasonable to expect that the latter should keep to
the high road with stolen goods trotting before him.  BELL-1911-2,175.363

The kha`n at Hasua is large and built on the Persian plan for Persian
pilgrims.  BELL-1911-2,175.364

We ate our lunch in the shadow of its gateway, BELL-1911-2,175.365

and when we came out the sun struck us in the face like a sword.
BELL-1911-2,175.366

There was nothing to be done but to try and forget it; BELL-1911-2,175.367

I summoned Fattu`h BELL-1911-2,175.368

and drew him into conversation.  BELL-1911-2,175.369

"Oh Fattu`h,"said I,"is there any justice in the land of the
Ottomans? "BELL-1911-2,175.370

"Effendim,"replied Fattu`h cautiously,"there is justice
BELL-1911-2,175.371

and there is injustice, as in other lands.  BELL-1911-2,175.372

Have I not told you of Rejef Pasha and the thief who stole from me +LT28?
"BELL-1911-2,175.373

"No,"said I, settling myself expectantly in the saddle.
BELL-1911-2,175.374

"It happened one year that I was in Baghda`d,"Fattu`h began,
BELL-1911-2,175.375

"for your Excellency knows that I drive the gentry back and forth between
Aleppo and Baghdad in my carriage, BELL-1911-2,175.376

and so it is that I am often in Baghda`d. "BELL-1911-2,175.377

"I know,"said I.  BELL-1911-2,175.378

"Once you sent me some blue and red belts embroidered with gold that
you had bought in the bazaars. "BELL-1911-2,175.379

"It is true,"said Fattu`h.  BELL-1911-2,175.380

"One I gave to Zeki`yeh, BELL-1911-2,175.381

and the others I sent by the post for you and for their Excellencies
your sisters.  BELL-1911-2,175.382

Please God they rejoiced to have them? "he inquired anxiously.
BELL-1911-2,175.383

"They rejoiced exceedingly,"I assured him for the fiftieth time;
BELL-1911-2,175.384

a present that has to be sent by the post is no small thing,
BELL-1911-2,175.385

and it would be matter for consternation if it did not please.
BELL-1911-2,175.386

"But what of Rejef Pasha? "BELL-1911-2,175.387

"Rejef Pasha was Mushi`r of Baghdad,"BELL-1911-2,175.388

Fattuh picked up his tale.  BELL-1911-2,175.389

"And God knows he was a just man.  BELL-1911-2,175.390

Now I had sold my carriage to one who needed it and gave me +LT28 for it,
which was a good price, BELL-1911-2,175.391

for it was old.  BELL-1911-2,175.392

And as I was walking in the bazaars a thief stole the money from me,
BELL-1911-2,175.393

and when I put my hand into my pocket, lo, it was empty. "
BELL-1911-2,175.394

"Wah, wah! "commiserated the zaptieh.  BELL-1911-2,175.395

"Eh yes,"said Fattu`h.  BELL-1911-2,175.396

"Twenty-eight Ottoman pounds.  BELL-1911-2,175.397

<P_176>

Now I had heard men speak of Rejef Pasha that he was famed for justice,
BELL-1911-2,176.399

and I went to him where he sat in the sera`yah BELL-1911-2,176.400

and said: Effendim, I am a man of Aleppo, a stranger in Baghdad;
BELL-1911-2,176.401

and a thief has stolen from me +LT28.  BELL-1911-2,176.402

And there are many here who can speak for me. 'BELL-1911-2,176.403

Then Rejef Pasha sent into the bazaars BELL-1911-2,176.404

and all the thieves he arrested. "BELL-1911-2,176.405

"Did he know them all? "I asked.  BELL-1911-2,176.406

"Without doubt,"replied Fattuh.  BELL-1911-2,176.407

"He was Mushi`r.  BELL-1911-2,176.408

And some he questioned BELL-1911-2,176.409

and let them go, BELL-1911-2,176.410

and others he caused to be beaten upon the soles of their feet with rods
, BELL-1911-2,176.411

and them too he released, until only three men remained, and then
only one.  BELL-1911-2,176.412

And Rejef Pasha said:'This is the thief. 'BELL-1911-2,176.413

Then they cast him upon the ground BELL-1911-2,176.414

and beat him many times, BELL-1911-2,176.415

and every time when they had beaten him till he could bear no more,
he cried out:'Cease the beating, and I will give back the money.
'BELL-1911-2,176.416

But when they ceased he said he had not so much as a meji`deh.
BELL-1911-2,176.417

Then one of the soldiers caught him by the leg to throw him to the ground
, BELL-1911-2,176.418

and the man's garment tore in his hand, BELL-1911-2,176.419

and out of it fell +LT26 BELL-1911-2,176.420

and rolled upon the floor.  BELL-1911-2,176.421

But two pounds he had eaten,"explained Fattuh.  BELL-1911-2,176.422

"And Rejef Pasha cast him into prison.  BELL-1911-2,176.423

And when I was next in Baghdad he was still in prison, BELL-1911-2,176.424

and I visited him BELL-1911-2,176.425

and lent him +LTI BELL-1911-2,176.426

for he was very poor.  BELL-1911-2,176.427

And we ate together. "BELL-1911-2,176.428

"Did you see him again? "said I, deeply interested in this simple history.
BELL-1911-2,176.429

"Eh, wallah! "replied Fattu`h.  BELL-1911-2,176.430

"I met him in Deir, BELL-1911-2,176.431

and there I feasted him in the bazaar.  BELL-1911-2,176.432

And now he lives in Deir, BELL-1911-2,176.433

and I go to his house whenever I pass through the town,
BELL-1911-2,176.434

for we are like brothers.  BELL-1911-2,176.435

But he has not returned me the pound I lent him while he was in prison,
"added Fattu`h regretfully.  BELL-1911-2,176.436

"Ma`shallah! "said the zaptieh.  BELL-1911-2,176.437

"Rejef Pasha was a good man. "BELL-1911-2,176.438

"But I will tell you another tale of Rejef Pasha, better than the last
,"pursued Fattu`h, drawing, with the perfect art of the narrator, upon
yet choicer stores of his memory - BELL-1911-2,176.439

or was it of his imagination?  BELL-1911-2,176.440

"Effendim, I had a friend, BELL-1911-2,176.441

and he hired from me one of my carriages that he might drive a certain
daftarda`r from Aleppo to Baghda`d.  BELL-1911-2,176.442

Now at Rama`di` <P_177> the daftarda`r spent two nights in the house of
the son of his uncle, BELL-1911-2,177.443

and when they reached Baghda`d the daftarda`r searched in his box for
the gold ornaments of his wife, BELL-1911-2,177.444

and, look you, they were missing.  BELL-1911-2,177.445

And they cost +LT60.  BELL-1911-2,177.446

Then the daftarda`r said that the carriage driver had stolen them,
BELL-1911-2,177.447

and he caused him to be imprisoned for a period of three years.
BELL-1911-2,177.448

And soon after, I came to Baghda`d BELL-1911-2,177.449

and inquired concerning my carriage; BELL-1911-2,177.450

and a man in the bazaar told me that which had befallen,
BELL-1911-2,177.451

but I did not believe that my friend had stolen the gold ornaments of
the daftarda`r's wife.  BELL-1911-2,177.452

And the man in the bazaar said:'You are his friend, BELL-1911-2,177.453

and moreover you are a walad melih, a good lad, BELL-1911-2,177.454

and he has a wife and two little children in Aleppo.  BELL-1911-2,177.455

You will not let him starve in prison. 'BELL-1911-2,177.456

And when I heard him call me a walad meli`h and thought upon the children
in Aleppo, I went away BELL-1911-2,177.457

and sold my two carriages for +LT60, BELL-1911-2,177.458

and set my friend free.  BELL-1911-2,177.459

And then,"Fattu`h continued his gratifying reminiscences,"I went to a
scribe in the bazaar BELL-1911-2,177.460

and gave him half a meji`deh.  BELL-1911-2,177.461

And your Excellency knows that a scribe charges one piastre.
BELL-1911-2,177.462

And I said:'Take this half meji`deh BELL-1911-2,177.463

and write a letter to Rejef Pasha that shall be worthy to be sent to
the Sultan BELL-1911-2,177.464

and explain to him the whole matter. 'BELL-1911-2,177.465

So the scribe wrote the letter, BELL-1911-2,177.466

and I took it to the serayah.  BELL-1911-2,177.467

Then Rejef Pasha called me before him, BELL-1911-2,177.468

for he had not forgotten me, nor the +LT28 that were stolen by the thief.
BELL-1911-2,177.469

And he said:'My son, do not fear.  BELL-1911-2,177.470

I will get back your money if I have to pay from the treasury of our
Lord the Sultan. 'BELL-1911-2,177.471

And he sent for the daftarda`r BELL-1911-2,177.472

and rebuked him for committing a man to prison without evidence,
BELL-1911-2,177.473

for he said that without doubt the gold ornaments had been stolen at
Rama`di`.  BELL-1911-2,177.474

And the daftarda`r paid me back +LT60.  BELL-1911-2,177.475

Never was there a pasha like Rejef Pasha,"concluded Fattu`h.
BELL-1911-2,177.476

"He feared none but God.  BELL-1911-2,177.477

God give him peace - BELL-1911-2,177.478

he died a year ago. "BELL-1911-2,177.479

Late in the afternoon we came to Mahmu`di`yeh.  BELL-1911-2,177.480

The baggage got in half-an-hour afterwards, BELL-1911-2,177.481

and found me established in the upper room of a kha`n which Ju`sef had
noted down as he passed through on his way to Kerbela` as"the very place
for our effendi. "BELL-1911-2,177.482

The room was cooler than a <P_178> tent, BELL-1911-2,178.483

and to sit in the shade and drink tea seemed to me to be the consummation
of earthly happiness.  BELL-1911-2,178.484

My lodging opened on to a flat roof on which I dined, and realized that
the more intolerably blasting the day, the more perfect was the soft
and delicate night.  BELL-1911-2,178.485

The kha`nji`, when he heard that we were bound for Ctesiphon,
declared that the Tigris was in flood and the road under water.
BELL-1911-2,178.486

We stood aghast, seeing a second enemy flow into the field just as we
had circumvented the first, BELL-1911-2,178.487

but a Kurdish zaptieh <paren> his name was'Abdu'l Kadir <$$paren>
stepped up with a smart salute BELL-1911-2,178.488

and bade us take courage, BELL-1911-2,178.489

for he would lead us to Ctesiphon.  BELL-1911-2,178.490

He was as good as his word; BELL-1911-2,178.491

there was, in fact, no water on the road.  BELL-1911-2,178.492

We reached the mounds of Seleucia in three hours, BELL-1911-2,178.493

and in another half-hour camped by the Tigris under the ruined wall of
the Greek city.  BELL-1911-2,178.494

The Tigris, where we came to it, was a mighty stream and a well-conducted.
BELL-1911-2,178.495

It flowed solemnly between its low banks, which it did not attempt to
overstep, in spite of the fact that the snows were beginning to melt in
the Kurdish hills and the river was in flood.  BELL-1911-2,178.496

A belt of cultivation ran like a narrow green ribbon beside it
, intersected by a network of irrigation canals which were fed by a
regiment of jirds along the bank.  BELL-1911-2,178.497

The whole area of Seleucia was covered with corn, BELL-1911-2,178.498

but $half $a $mile {TEXT:half-a-mile} inland the relentless desert
resumed its rule, BELL-1911-2,178.499

for the crops that had been sown beyond the irrigation streams, in
expectation of the usual sprinkling of winter rain, had never sprouted.
BELL-1911-2,178.500

Out of the cornfields rose the mounds of Seleucia, the capital of the
Seleucid empire, which for two hundred years after the death of Alexander
embraced Mesopotamia, North Syria and a varying part of Asia Minor.
BELL-1911-2,178.501

Of all cities in Turkey, Seleucia is perhaps the one which would yield
most to the spade of the excavator.  BELL-1911-2,178.502

The Greek civilization of the Diadochi has given up few of its secrets
in any of the regions where the generals of Alexander cut their empires
out of the fruits of his victories, BELL-1911-2,178.503

but in Mesopotamia we are completely ignorant of what the Greek conquest
may have meant in the history of architecture and the lesser arts.
BELL-1911-2,178.504

We know only that at the end of the period of Greek rule the arts emerged
profoundly <P_179> modified, and thus modified governed the late antique
and the early Christian world.  BELL-1911-2,179.505

I had no sooner appointed a camping-ground than I embarked on the broad
waters of the Tigris in a basket.  BELL-1911-2,179.506

The craft that navigate that river are known in Arabic as guffahs,
BELL-1911-2,179.507

but I have applied to them the correct English word <paren> Fig.
110 <$$paren>.  BELL-1911-2,179.508

They are round with an incurving lip, like any other basket, made of
plaited withes and pitched without and within to keep them water-tight.
BELL-1911-2,179.509

Their size and the pitch alone differentiate them from their fellows in
the European market, BELL-1911-2,179.510

and I readily admit that when first you are invited to cross a
deep and rapid stream in a guffah you feel a shadow of reluctance.
BELL-1911-2,179.511

But for all their unpromising appearance they are stout and trustworthy
vessels, BELL-1911-2,179.512

and when you have crossed once, you and your zaptieh and your mares
all in the same guffah, and accustomed yourself to its peculiar mode
of progression, you come to feel a justifiable confidence in it.
BELL-1911-2,179.513

The guffah $can $not {TEXT:cannot} make headway against stream;
BELL-1911-2,179.514

it must be pulled up the river to a distance considerably above the
point you design to touch on the opposite bank - BELL-1911-2,179.515

the two guffahji`s push off, BELL-1911-2,179.516

the basket spins upon its axis, BELL-1911-2,179.517

and so spinning advances, on the principle of the moon's advance across
space, or, for that matter, of the earth's; BELL-1911-2,179.518

the guffahji`s paddle with a genteel nonchalance, first on one side and
then on the other, BELL-1911-2,179.519

and at the end of all you reach your goal.  BELL-1911-2,179.520

My goal was Ctesiphon <paren> Fig. 107 <$$paren>.
BELL-1911-2,179.521

The huge fragment of the palace, which is all that remains of the
Sassanian capital, successor and heir to Seleucia, lies about $half $a
$mile {TEXT:half-a-mile} from the river on the edge of a reed-grown marsh.
BELL-1911-2,179.522

No more of it is standing than the central vaulted hall <paren> and
here half the vault has fallen <$$paren> and the east wall of one of
the wings <paren> Fig. 108 <$$paren>.  BELL-1911-2,179.523

The second wing has disappeared, BELL-1911-2,179.524

and nothing is left of the rooms on either side of the hall <paren>
Fig. 109 <$$paren>.  BELL-1911-2,179.525

Even in this condition Ctesiphon is the most remarkable of all known
<P_180> Sassanian buildings and one of the most imposing ruins in
the world.  BELL-1911-2,180.526

The great curtain of wall, the face of the right wing, rises stark and
gaunt out of the desert, bearing upon its surface a shallow decoration
of niches and engaged columns which is the final word in the Asiatic
treatment of wall spaces, the end of the long history of artistic
endeavour which began with the Babylonians and was quickened into fresh
vigour by the Greeks.  BELL-1911-2,180.527

Tradition has it that the whole wall was covered with precious metals.
BELL-1911-2,180.528

The gigantic vault, built over empty space without the use of
centering beams, is one of the most stupendous creations of any age.
BELL-1911-2,180.529

It spans 25.80 metres: BELL-1911-2,180.530

the barrel vaults of the basilica of Maxentius in the Roman Forum span
23.50 metres; BELL-1911-2,180.531

the barrel vault that covered the aula of Domitian's palace on the
Palatine spanned 30.40 metres, BELL-1911-2,180.532

but it has fallen.  BELL-1911-2,180.533

The Roman vaults were built over centering beams, not over space on the
Mesopotamian system, BELL-1911-2,180.534

and the latter, what with the appeal which it makes to the imagination
and the high ovoid curve which it involves, gives a result incomparably
more impressive.  BELL-1911-2,180.535

In this hall Chosroes held his court.  BELL-1911-2,180.536

It must have lain open to the rising sun, BELL-1911-2,180.537

or perhaps the entrance was sheltered by a curtain which hung from the
top of the vault down to the floor.  BELL-1911-2,180.538

The Arab historian, Tabari`, gives an account of a carpet seventy cubits
long and sixty cubits broad which formed part of the booty when the
Mohammadans sacked the city.  BELL-1911-2,180.539

It was woven into the likeness of a garden; BELL-1911-2,180.540

the ground was worked in gold and the paths in silver; BELL-1911-2,180.541

the meadows were of emeralds and the streams of pearls; the trees, flowers
and fruits of diamonds and other precious stones.  BELL-1911-2,180.542

Such a texture as this may have been drawn aside to reveal the Great King
seated in state in his hall of audience, with the light of a thousand
lamps, suspended from the roof, catching his jewelled tiara, his sword and
girdle, illuminating the hangings on the walls and the robes and trappings
of the army of courtiers who stood round the throne.  BELL-1911-2,180.543

The pages of the historian who relates the Mohammadan conquest
of Ctesiphon ring still with the triumph of that victory.
BELL-1911-2,180.544

The Sassanian capital comprised both the old Greek <P_181> foundation on
the west bank of the river and the later Persian town with its palaces
on the east bank.  BELL-1911-2,181.545

Sa'd ibn abi Wakka`s, the leader of the army of Isla`m, had little to
fear from the last of the Sassanian kings, Yazdegird, a boy of twenty-one,
BELL-1911-2,181.546

and having entered the western city <paren> known to the Arabs as
Bahurasi`r <$$paren> without striking a blow, he assembled his troops
BELL-1911-2,181.547

and, Kura`n in hand, pointed to the fulfilment of prophecy:
BELL-1911-2,181.548

"Did ye not swear aforetime that ye would never pass away?
BELL-1911-2,181.549

Yet ye inhabited the dwellings of a people that had dealt unjustly by
their own souls, BELL-1911-2,181.550

and ye saw how we dealt with them.  BELL-1911-2,181.551

We made them a warning and an example to you. "BELL-1911-2,181.552

"And when the Moslems entered Bahurasi`r, and that was in the middle of
the night, the White Palace flashed upon them.  BELL-1911-2,181.553

Then said Dira`r ibn u'l Khatta`b:'God is great!  BELL-1911-2,181.554

the White Palace of Chosroes!  BELL-1911-2,181.555

This is what God and his Prophet promised. '"BELL-1911-2,181.556

But the fording of the Tigris was a serious matter, BELL-1911-2,181.557

and some days passed before Sa'd announced to the army that he had
resolved to make the venture.  BELL-1911-2,181.558

"And all of them cried:'God has resolved on the right path for us and
for thee; BELL-1911-2,181.559

act thou. 'BELL-1911-2,181.560

And Sa'd urged the people to the ford BELL-1911-2,181.561

and said: Who will lead, and guard for us the head of the ford that the
people may follow him?  BELL-1911-2,181.562

And'A`sim ibn'Amr came forward and after him six hundred men.
BELL-1911-2,181.563

And he said:'Who will go with me and guard the head of the passage <P_182>
that the people may ford? 'BELL-1911-2,182.564

And there came forward sixty.  BELL-1911-2,182.565

And when the Persians saw what they did, they plunged into the Tigris
against them BELL-1911-2,182.566

and swam their horses towards them.  BELL-1911-2,182.567

And'A`sim they met in the forefront, BELL-1911-2,182.568

for he had neared the head of the ford.  BELL-1911-2,182.569

Then said'A`sim:'The spears!  the spears!  BELL-1911-2,182.570

aim them at their eyes. 'BELL-1911-2,182.571

And they joined in contest BELL-1911-2,182.572

and the Moslems aimed at their eyes BELL-1911-2,182.573

and they turned back towards the bank.  BELL-1911-2,182.574

And the Moslems urged on their horses against them BELL-1911-2,182.575

and caught them on the bank BELL-1911-2,182.576

and killed the greater part of them; BELL-1911-2,182.577

and he who escaped, escaped one eyed {COM:sic}.  BELL-1911-2,182.578

And their horses trembled under them until they broke from the ford.
BELL-1911-2,182.579

And when Sa'd saw'Asim at the head of the ford he said:'Say: We call
upon the Lord BELL-1911-2,182.580

and in Him we put our trust BELL-1911-2,182.581

and excellent is the Entrusted; BELL-1911-2,182.582

there is no power nor strength but in God, the Exalted, the Almighty.
'BELL-1911-2,182.583

And when Sa'd entered Mada`in and saw it deserted, he came to the hall
of Chosroes BELL-1911-2,182.584

and began to read:'How many gardens and fountains have they left
behind, cornfields and fair dwellings and delights which were theirs;
BELL-1911-2,182.585

thus we dispossessed them thereof BELL-1911-2,182.586

and gave their possession for an inheritance unto another people.
'BELL-1911-2,182.587

And he repeated the opening prayer BELL-1911-2,182.588

and made eight prostrations.  BELL-1911-2,182.589

And he chose the hall for a mosque; BELL-1911-2,182.590

and in it were effigies in plaster of men and horses BELL-1911-2,182.591

and they heeded them not BELL-1911-2,182.592

but left them as they were, though the Mohammadans do not so.
BELL-1911-2,182.593

And we entered Mada`in BELL-1911-2,182.594

and came to domed chambers filled with baskets; BELL-1911-2,182.595

and we thought them to be food, BELL-1911-2,182.596

and lo, they were overflowing with gold and silver.  BELL-1911-2,182.597

And they were divided among the people.  BELL-1911-2,182.598

And we found much camphor BELL-1911-2,182.599

and thought it to be salt, BELL-1911-2,182.600

and kneaded it into the bread, until we perceived the bitterness of it
in the bread.  BELL-1911-2,182.601

And Zuhrah ibn u'l Hawiyeh went out with the vanguard BELL-1911-2,182.602

and pursued the fugitives till he reached the bridge of Nahrwa`n;
BELL-1911-2,182.603

and the fugitives crowded upon it BELL-1911-2,182.604

and a mule fell into the water, BELL-1911-2,182.605

and they struggled round it greedily.  BELL-1911-2,182.606

And Zuhrah said:'Verily, I believe, billah, that the mule bears something
precious. 'BELL-1911-2,182.607

And that which it bore was the regalia of Chosroes, his robes and his
strings of pearls, his girdle and his armour covered <P_183> with jewels,
in which he was wont to sit, vaingloriously attired.  "{COM:ellipsis}
BELL-1911-2,183.608

In the grey dawn I returned to Ctesiphon.  BELL-1911-2,183.609

The moon was setting in the west BELL-1911-2,183.610

and as we floated down the river the sun rose out of the east
BELL-1911-2,183.611

and struck the ruined hall of the palace.  BELL-1911-2,183.612

"Allah, Allah"murmured'Abdu'l Ka`dir, moved to wonder as he watched
the vast walls, in their unmatched desolation, take on the glory of
another day.  BELL-1911-2,183.613

We rode up to Baghda`d along the edge of the Tigris, BELL-1911-2,183.614

and as we went, Fattu`h, who thought little of ruins except as a
divertisement for the gentry, dilated upon the splendours that we were
to witness.  BELL-1911-2,183.615

Especially was he anxious that I should not fail to see the famous
cannon which stands near the arsenal, chained to the ground lest it
should fly away.  BELL-1911-2,183.616

"For,"said Fattu`h,"the people of Baghdad relate that in a certain
year there was a great battle at a distance of many days'journey.
BELL-1911-2,183.617

Now the soldiers of Baghda`d were giving way before the enemy when
one looked up and saw the cannon flying through the air to their help.
BELL-1911-2,183.618

And without the aid of hands it fired at the army of the foe
BELL-1911-2,183.619

and drove them back.  BELL-1911-2,183.620

Then they brought the cannon back with them BELL-1911-2,183.621

and chained it by the arsenal, BELL-1911-2,183.622

for they prized it mightily.  BELL-1911-2,183.623

So I have heard in Baghda`d. "BELL-1911-2,183.624

"And what do you think of the story? "I asked.  BELL-1911-2,183.625

"My lady,"said Fattu`h with a fine show of contempt,"the people of
Baghda`d are very ignorant.  BELL-1911-2,183.626

They will believe anything.  BELL-1911-2,183.627

But we in Aleppo would laugh if we were told that a cannon had flown
through the air. "BELL-1911-2,183.628

Every few hundred yards we came upon the deep cutting of an irrigation
canal BELL-1911-2,183.629

and our road passed over it airily, borne on the most fragile of bridges.
BELL-1911-2,183.630

At first I could scarcely control my alarm as I saw rider and baggage
animals suspended above the gulf, BELL-1911-2,183.631

but the horses made light of it BELL-1911-2,183.632

and no one can keep up a fear that is unshared by his comrades.
BELL-1911-2,183.633

We were fortunate in finding all the bridges intact, BELL-1911-2,183.634

but our good luck deserted us in the middle of the day,
BELL-1911-2,183.635

and when we came to Gara`rah, where we hoped to cross the Tigris by a
<P_184> bridge of boats, we found that the bridge had been swept away
and the keeper of the toll-house seemed surprised to learn that we had
expected it to stand firm in time of flood.  BELL-1911-2,184.636

So we turned wearily round an immense bend of the Tigris
BELL-1911-2,184.637

and entered Baghda`d by the Hilleh road <paren> Fig. 111 <$$paren>.
BELL-1911-2,184.638

Here the pontoon bridge had been mercifully spared; BELL-1911-2,184.639

it was crowded with folk, BELL-1911-2,184.640

and as we pushed our way slowly across it I had time to offer up a short
thanksgiving for the first stage of a journey successfully accomplished,
new roads traversed, unvisited sites explored, another web of delightful
experiences woven and laid by.  BELL-1911-2,184.641

At the end of the bridge we found ourselves in the bazaars
BELL-1911-2,184.642

and made our way to the British Residency.  BELL-1911-2,184.643

It is a pleasant thing to be English and to see the Sikh guard leap
to the salute at the gateway of that place by the Tigris which is our
much-envied Consulate General.  BELL-1911-2,184.644

My thanksgiving must certainly have broken into a hymn of praise when I
found that the hospitable Resident and his wife were expecting my arrival
and had prepared for me a room almost as spacious as the hall of Chosroes.
BELL-1911-2,184.645

At Baghda`d I learnt that the rumours of a revolt which had reached
Babylon fell far short of the truth.  BELL-1911-2,184.646

Two of the Tigris tribes were up in arms BELL-1911-2,184.647

and had effectually blocked all communication with Basra and the
Persian Gulf.  BELL-1911-2,184.648

They were holding up five steamers at Ama`rah, together with a couple
of gunboats, which had been sent down to clear the channel, and over
two thousand soldiers.  BELL-1911-2,184.649

Among the passengers was Sir William Willcocks, who was at that time
engaged on the irrigation survey, BELL-1911-2,184.650

and the disturbance had therefore become a matter of grave concern to
the Resident and to all others who had the interests of Turkey at heart.
BELL-1911-2,184.651

During the few days which I spent in Baghda`d, I saw many people
BELL-1911-2,184.652

and heard much talk concerning the state of affairs that prevailed in
the delta, BELL-1911-2,184.653

and I came to the conclusion that the government were garnering the ripe
fruit both of their inaction and of their action.  BELL-1911-2,184.654

On the one hand, the Arab tribes had been allowed to reach an alarming
excess of insubordination.  BELL-1911-2,184.655

For three years the boats of the Turkish and the Lynch Company had been
exposed to perpetual danger of attack, BELL-1911-2,184.656

and in 1908 one of the steamers of the Lynch <P_185> Company had been
fired upon BELL-1911-2,185.657

and several persons had been killed or wounded.  BELL-1911-2,185.658

Nevertheless no attempt has been made to bring the sheikhs to justice.
BELL-1911-2,185.659

In remoter districts, even where the land was under cultivation, the
fiction of established government had been for all practical purposes
abandoned.  BELL-1911-2,185.660

Where the tax-gatherers still ventured to put in an appearance they were
bribed by the Arabs, BELL-1911-2,185.661

and little money flowed through their hands into the imperial treasury,
while not infrequently they did not dare to breathe the name of taxes.
BELL-1911-2,185.662

"The very shepherds are armed with rifles,"said one, BELL-1911-2,185.663

"and if I were to ask them to pay the aghna`m, the sheep tax, they
would raise their guns to their shoulders, saying:'Take the aghna`m.
'"BELL-1911-2,185.664

On the other hand, the authorities had sought to cover their weakness
by setting one sheikh against another and thus fostering disorder.
BELL-1911-2,185.665
