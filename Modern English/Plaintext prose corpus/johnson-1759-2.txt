Chap. XV.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,79.3

The prince and princess leave the valley, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,79.4

and see many wonders.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,79.5

<$$heading>

The prince and princess had jewels sufficient to make them rich whenever
<P_1,80> they came into a place of commerce, which, by Imlac's direction ,
they hid in their cloaths, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.7

and, on the night of the next full moon, all left the valley.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.8

The princess was followed only by a single favourite, who did not know
whither she was going.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.9

They clambered through the cavity, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.10

and began to go down on the other side.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.11

The princess and her maid turned their eyes towards every part,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.12

and, seeing nothing to bound their prospect, considered themselves in
danger of being lost in a dreary vacuity.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.13

They stopped and trembled.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.14

"I am almost afraid, said the princess, to begin a journey of which I
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} perceive an end, and to venture into this immense
plain where I may be approached on every side by men whom I never saw.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.15

The prince felt nearly the same emotions, though he thought it more
manly to conceal them.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,80.16

<P_1,81>

Imlac smiled at their terrors, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.18

and encouraged them to proceed; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.19

but the princess continued irresolute, till she had been imperceptibly
drawn forward too far to return.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.20

In the morning they found some shepherds in the field, who set some milk
and fruits before them.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.21

The princess wondered that she did not see a palace ready for her
reception, and a table spread with delicacies; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.22

but, being faint and hungry, she drank the milk JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.23

and eat the fruits, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.24

and thought them of a higher flavour than the products of the valley.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.25

They travelled forward by easy journeys, being all unaccustomed to
toil and difficulty, and knowing that, though they might be missed,
they could not be pursued.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,81.26

In a few days they came into a more populous region, where Imlac
was diverted with the admiration which his companions expressed
at the <P_1,82> diversity of manners, stations, and employments.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.27

Their dress was such as might not bring upon them the suspicion of having
anything to conceal, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.28

yet the prince, wherever he came, expected to be obeyed,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.29

and the princess was frighted, because those who came into her presence
did not prostrate themselves.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.30

Imlac was forced to observe them with great vigilance, lest they should
betray their rank by their unusual behaviour, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.31

and detained them several weeks in the first village to accustom them
to the sight of common mortals.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.32

By degrees the royal wanderers were taught to understand that they had
for a time laid aside their dignity, and were to expect only such regard
as liberality and courtesy could procure.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,82.33

And Imlac having, by many admonitions, prepared them to endure the
tumults of a port and the ruggedness <P_1,83> of the commercial race,
brought them down to the sea-coast.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.34

The prince and his sister, to whom everything was new, were gratified
equally at all places, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.35

and therefore remained for some months at the port without any inclination
to pass further.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.36

Imlac was content with their stay, because he did not think it safe
to expose them, unpractised in the world, to the hazards of a foreign
country.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.37

At last he began to fear lest they should be discovered,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.38

and proposed to fix a day for their departure.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.39

They had no pretensions to judge for themselves, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.40

and referred the whole scheme to his direction.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.41

He therefore took passage in a ship to Suez; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.42

and, when the time came, with great difficulty prevailed on the princess
to enter the vessel.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.43

They had a quick and prosperous voyage, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.44

and from Suez travelled by land to Cairo.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,83.45

<P_1,84>

<heading>

Chap. XVI.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.48

They enter Cairo, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.49

and find every man happy.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.50

<$$heading>

As they approached the city, which filled the strangers with astonishment
,"This, said Imlac to the prince, is the place where travellers and
merchants assemble from all corners of the earth.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.52

You will here find men of every character, and every occupation.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.53

Commerce is here honourable: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.54

I will act as a merchant, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.55

and you shall live as strangers, who have no other end of travel than
curiosity; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.56

it will soon be observed that we are rich; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.57

our reputation will procure us access to all whom we shall desire to
know; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.58

you shall see all the conditions of humanity, and enable
yourselves at leisure to make your <font> choice of life. "<$$font>
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.59

They now entered the town, stunned by the noise, and offended by the
crowds.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,84.60

Instruction <P_1,85> had not yet so prevailed over habit, but that
they wondered to see themselves pass undistinguished along the street
, and met by the lowest of the people without reverence or notice.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.61

The princess could not at first bear the thought of being levelled with
the vulgar, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.62

and, for some days, continued in her chamber, where she was served by
her favourite as in the palace of the valley.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.63

Imlac, who understood traffick, sold part of the jewels the next day,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.64

and hired a house, which he adorned with such magnificence, that
he was immediately considered as a merchant of great wealth.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.65

His politeness attracted many acquaintance {COM:sic},
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.66

and his generosity made him courted by many dependants.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.67

His table was crowded by men of every nation, who all admired his
knowledge and solicited his favour.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.68

His companions, not being able to mix in the conversation, could make
no discovery of their ignorance or surprise, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.69

and were gradually initiated in the world as they gained knowledge of
the language.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,85.70

<P_1,86>

The prince had, by frequent lectures, been taught the use and nature of
money; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,86.72

but the ladies could not, for a long time, comprehend what the merchants
did with small pieces of gold and silver, or why things of so little
use should be received as an equivalent to the necessaries of life.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,86.73

They studied the language two years, while Imlac was preparing
to set before them the various ranks and conditions of mankind.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,86.74

He grew acquainted with all who had anything uncommon in their fortune
or conduct.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,86.75

He frequented the voluptuous and the frugal, the idle and the busy,
the merchants and the men of learning.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,86.76

The prince now being able to converse with fluency, and having learned
the caution necessary to be observed in his intercourse with strangers,
began to accompany Imlac to <P_1,87> places of resort, and to enter into
all assemblies, that he might make his <font> choice of life.  <$$font>
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.77

For some time he thought choice needless, because all appeared to him
equally happy.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.78

Wherever he went he met gaiety and kindness, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.79

and heard the song of joy or the laugh of carelessness.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.80

He began to believe that the world overflowed with universal plenty,
and that nothing was with-held either from want or merit; that every
hand showered liberality, and every heart melted with benevolence:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.81

"and who then, says he, will be suffered to be wretched? "
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.82

Imlac permitted the pleasing delusion, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.83

and was unwilling to crush the hope of inexperience, till one day , having
sat awhile silent,"I know not, said the prince, what can be the reason
that I am more unhappy than any of our friends.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.84

I see them perpetually and unalterably cheerful, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.85

but feel my own mind restless and uneasy.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,87.86

I am unsatisfied <P_1,88> with those pleasures which I seem most to
court; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.87

I live in the crowds of jollity, not so much to enjoy company as to shun
myself, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.88

and am only loud and merry to conceal my sadness. " JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.89

"Every man, said Imlac, may by examining his own mind guess what passes
in the minds of others: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.90

when you feel that your own gaiety is counterfeit, it may justly
lead you to suspect that of your companions not to be sincere.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.91

Envy is commonly reciprocal.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.92

We are long before we are convinced that happiness is never to be found
, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.93

and each believes it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of
obtaining it for himself.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.94

In the assembly where you passed the last night there appeared such
sprightliness of air, and volatility of fancy, as might have suited
beings of a higher order, formed to inhabit serener regions inaccessible
to care or sorrow: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,88.95

yet, believe me, prince, was there not one who did <P_1,89> not dread
the moment when solitude should deliver him to the tyranny of reflection.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,1,89.96

"This, said the prince, may be true of others since it is true of me ;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,89.97

yet, whatever be the general infelicity of man, one condition is more
happy than another, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,89.98

and wisdom surely directs us to take the least evil in the <font> choice
of life. "<$$font> JOHNSON-1759-2,1,89.99

"The causes of good and evil, answered Imlac, are so various and
uncertain, so often entangled with each other, so diversified by various
relations, and so much subject to accidents which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be foreseen, that he who would fix his condition upon incontestable
reasons of preference, must live and die inquiring and deliberating.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,1,89.100

"But surely, said Rasselas, the wise men, to whom we listen with reverence
and wonder, chose that mode of life for themselves <P_1,90> which they
thought most likely to make them happy. " JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.101

"Very few, said the poet, live by choice.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.102

Every man is placed in the present condition by causes which acted without
his foresight, and with which he did not always willingly co-operate;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.103

and therefore you will rarely meet one who does not think the lot of
his neighbour better than his own. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.104

"I am pleased to think, said the prince, that my birth has given me at
least one advantage over others by enabling me to determine for myself.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.105

I have here the world before me; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.106

I will review it at leisure: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.107

surely happiness is somewhere to be found. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,90.108

Chap. XVII.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.111

The prince associates with young men of spirit and gaiety.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.112

<$$heading>

Rasselas rose next day, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.114

and resolved to begin his experiments upon life.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.115

"Youth, cried he, is the time of gladness: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.116

I will join myself to the young men whose only business is to
gratify their desires, and whose time is all spent in a succession of
enjoyments. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.117

To such societies he was readily admitted, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.118

but a few days brought him back weary and disgusted.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.119

Their mirth was without images, their laughter without motive;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.120

their pleasures were gross and sensual, in which the mind had no part;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.121

their conduct was at once wild and mean; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.122

they laughed at order and at law, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.123

but the frown of power dejected, and the eye of wisdom abashed them.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,91.124

<P_1,92>

The prince soon concluded, that he should never be happy in a course of
life of which he was ashamed.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.126

He thought it unsuitable to a reasonable being to act without a plan,
and to be sad or cheerful only by chance.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.127

"Happiness, said he, must be something solid and permanent, without fear
and without uncertainty. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.128

But his young companions had gained so much of his regard by their
frankness and courtesy, that he could not leave them without warning
and remonstrance.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.129

"My friends, said he, I have seriously considered our manners and our
prospects, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.130

and find that we have mistaken our own interest.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.131

The first years of man must make provision for the last.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.132

He that never thinks, never can be wise.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.133

Perpetual levity must end in ignorance; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.134

and intemperance, though it may fire the spirits for an hour, will make
life short or miserable.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,92.135

Let us consider that youth is of no long <P_1,93> duration, and that in
mature age, when the enchantments of fancy shall cease, and phantoms of
delight dance no more about us, we shall have no comforts but the esteem
of wise men, and the means of doing good.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.136

Let us, therefore, stop, while to stop is in our power:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.137

let us live as men who are some time to grow old, and to whom it will
be the most dreadful of all evils not to count their past years but by
follies, and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only
by the maladies which riot has produced. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.138

They stared awhile in silence one upon another, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.139

and at last drove him away by a general chorus of continued laughter.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.140

The consciousness that his sentiments were just, and his intentions kind
, was scarcely sufficient to support him against the horror of derision.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.141

But he recovered his tranquillity, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.142

and pursued his search.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,93.143

<P_1,94>

Chap. XVIII.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.146

The prince finds a wise and happy man.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.147

<$$heading>

As he was one day walking in the street, he saw a spacious building which
all were, by the open doors, invited to enter: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.149

he followed the stream of people, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.150

and found it a hall or school of declamation, in which professors read
lectures to their auditory.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.151

He fixed his eye upon a sage raised above the rest, who discoursed with
great energy on the government of the passions.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.152

His look was venerable, his action graceful, his pronunciation clear,
and his diction elegant.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,94.153

He shewed, with great strength of sentiment and variety of illustration
, that human nature is degraded and debased, when the lower faculties
predominate over the higher; that when fancy, the parent of passion
, usurps the dominion of the mind, nothing ensues but <P_1,95> the
natural effect of unlawful government, perturbation and confusion
; that she betrays the fortresses of the intellect to rebels, and
excites her children to sedition against their lawful sovereign.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,95.154

He compared reason to the sun, of which the light is constant, uniform
, and lasting; and fancy to a meteor, of bright but transitory
lustre, irregular in its motion and delusive in its direction.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,95.155

He then communicated the various precepts given from time to time for
the conquest of passion, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,95.156

and displayed the happiness of those who had obtained the important
victory, after which man is no longer the slave of fear, nor the fool
of hope; is no more emaciated by envy, inflamed by anger, emasculated
by tenderness, or depressed by grief; but walks on calmly through the
tumults or the privacies, of life, as the sun pursues alike his course
through the calm or the stormy sky.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,95.157

<P_1,96>

He enumerated many examples of heroes immovable by pain or pleasure,
who looked with indifference on those modes or accidents to which the
vulgar give the names of good and evil.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,96.159

He exhorted his hearers to lay aside their prejudices, and arm themselves
against the shafts of malice or misfortune, by invulnerable patience;
concluding, that this state only was happiness, and that this happiness
was in every one's power.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,96.160

Rasselas listened to him with the veneration due to the instructions of
a superior being, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,96.161

and, waiting for him at the door, humbly implored the liberty of visiting
so great a master of true wisdom.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,96.162

The lecturer hesitated a moment, when Rasselas put a purse of gold
into his hand, which he received with a mixture of joy and wonder.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,96.163

"I have found, said the prince at his return to Imlac, a man who can
teach all that is <P_1,97> necessary to be known, who, from the unshaken
throne of rational fortitude, looks down on the scenes of life changing
beneath him.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.164

He speaks, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.165

and attention watches his lips.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.166

He reasons, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.167

and conviction closes his periods.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.168

This man shall be my future guide: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.169

I will learn his doctrines and imitate his life. " JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.170

"Be not too hasty, said Imlac, to trust or to admire the teachers of
morality: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.171

they discourse like angels, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.172

but they live like men. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.173

Rasselas, who could not conceive how any man could reason so forcibly
without feeling the cogency of his own arguments, paid his visit in a
few days, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.174

and was denied admission.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.175

He had now learned the power of money, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.176

and made his way by a piece of gold to the inner apartment, where he
found the philosopher in a room half darkened, with his eyes misty and
his face pale.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,97.177

"Sir, said <P_1,98> he, you are come at a time when all human friendship
is useless; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.178

what I suffer $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be remedied: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.179

what I have lost $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be supplied.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.180

My daughter, my only daughter, from whose tenderness I expected all the
comforts of my age, died last night of a fever.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.181

My views, my purposes, my hopes, are at an end: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.182

I am now a lonely being, disunited from society. " JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.183

"Sir, said the prince, mortality is an event by which a wise man can
never be surprised: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.184

we know that death is always near, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.185

and it should therefore always be expected. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.186

"Young man, answered the philosopher, you speak like one that has never
felt the pangs of separation. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.187

"Have you then forgot the precepts, said Rasselas, which you so powerfully
enforced?  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.188

Has wisdom no strength to arm the heart against calamity?
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.189

Consider that external things are naturally variable, but truth and
reason are always the same. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,98.190

"What comfort, said the mourner, can <P_1,99> truth and reason afford me?
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,99.191

of what effect are they now, but to tell me, that my daughter will not
be restored? "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,99.192

The prince, whose humanity would not suffer him to insult misery
with reproof, went away, convinced of the emptiness of rhetorical
sound, and the inefficacy of polished periods and studied sentences.

Chap. XIX.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,99.195

A Glimpse of pastoral life.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,99.196

<$$heading>

He was still eager upon the same inquiry; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,99.198

and, having heard of a hermit, that lived near the lowest cataract of
the Nile, and filled the whole country with the fame of his sanctity,
resolved to visit his retreat, and inquire whether that felicity,
which publick life could not afford, was to be found in solitude;
and whether a man, whose age and virtue made him venerable, could
teach <P_1,100> any peculiar art of shunning evils, or enduring them.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.199

Imlac and the princess agreed to accompany him, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.200

and after the necessary preparations, they began their journey.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.201

Their way lay through the fields, where shepherds tended their flocks,
and the lambs were playing upon the pasture.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.202

"This, said the poet, is the life which has been often celebrated for
its innocence and quiet: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.203

let us pass the heat of the day among the shepherds tents, and know
whether all our searches are not to terminate in pastoral simplicity.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.204

The proposal pleased them, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.205

and they induced the shepherds, by small presents and familiar questions ,
to tell the opinion of their own state: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.206

they were so rude and ignorant, so little able to compare the good with
the evil of the occupation, and so indistinct in their narratives
and descriptions, that very little could be learned from them.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,100.207

But it was <P_1,101> evident that their hearts were cankered with
discontent; that they considered themselves as condemned to labour for
the luxury of the rich, and looked up with stupid malevolence towards
those that were placed above them.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,101.208

The princess pronounced with vehemence, that she would never suffer these
envious savages to be her companions, and that she should not soon be
desirous of seeing any more specimens of rustick happiness; but could not
believe that all the accounts of primeval pleasures were fabulous, and
was yet in doubt whether life had anything that could be justly preferred
to the placid gratification of fields and woods.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,101.209

She hoped that the time would come when, with a few virtuous and elegant
companions, she should gather flowers planted by her own hands, fondle the
lambs of her own ewe, and listen, without care, among brooks and breezes,
to one of her maidens reading in the shade.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,101.210

On the next day they continued their journey, till the heat compelled
them to look round for shelter.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,102.216

At a small distance they saw a thick wood, which they no sooner entered
than they perceived that they were approaching the habitations of men.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,102.217

The shrubs were diligently cut away to open walks where the shades were
darkest; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,102.218

the boughs of opposite trees were artificially interwoven;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,102.219

seats of flowery turf were raised in vacant spaces,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,102.220

and a rivulet that wantoned along the side of a winding path, had its
banks sometimes opened into small basons, and its stream sometimes
obstructed by little mounds of stone heaped together to increase its
murmurs.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,102.221

<P_1,103>

They passed slowly through the wood, delighted with such unexpected
accommodations, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.223

and entertained each other with conjecturing what, or, who he could be,
that in those rude and unfrequented regions, had leisure and art for
such harmless luxury.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.224

As they advanced, they heard the sound of music, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.225

and saw youths and virgins dancing in the grove; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.226

and going still farther, beheld a stately palace built upon a hill
surrounded by woods.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.227

The laws of eastern hospitality allowed them to enter,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.228

and the master welcomed them like a man liberal and wealthy.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.229

He was skilful enough in appearances soon to discern that they were no
common guests, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.230

and spread his table with magnificence.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.231

The eloquence of Imlac caught his attention, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.232

and the lofty courtesy of the princess excited his respect.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,103.233

When they offered to depart, he <P_1,104> entreated their stay,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.234

and was the next day more unwilling to dismiss them than before.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.235

They were easily persuaded to stop, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.236

and civility grew up in time to freedom and confidence.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.237

The prince now saw all the domesticks cheerful and all the face of nature
smiling round the place, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.238

and could not forbear to hope that he should find here what he was
seeking; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.239

but when he was congratulating the master upon his possessions,
he answered with a sigh,"My condition has indeed the appearance of
happiness, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.240

but appearances are delusive.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.241

My prosperity puts my life in danger; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.242

the Bassa of Egypt is my enemy, incensed only by my wealth and popularity.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.243

I have been hitherto protected against him by the princes of the country
; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.244

but as the favour of the great is uncertain, I know not how soon
my defenders may be persuaded to share the plunder with the Bassa.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.245

I have sent my treasures into a distant country, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,104.246

and, <P_1,105> upon the first alarm, am prepared to follow them.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.247

Then will my enemies riot in my mansion, and enjoy the gardens which I
have planted. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.248

They all joined in lamenting his danger, and deprecating his exile;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.249

and the princess was so much disturbed with the tumult of grief and
indignation, that she retired to her apartment.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.250

They continued with their kind inviter a few days longer,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.251

and then went to find the hermit.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.252

The happiness of solitude.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.255

The hermit's history.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.256

<$$heading>

They came on the third day, by the direction of the peasants, to the
hermit's cell: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,105.258

it was a cavern in the side of a mountain, over-shadow'd with palm-trees
; at such a distance from the cataract, <P_1,106> that nothing more was
heard than a gentle uniform murmur, such as composed the mind to pensive
meditation, especially when it was assisted by the wind whistling among
the branches.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,106.259

The first rude essay of nature had been so much improved by human labour,
that the cave contained several apartments, appropriated to different
uses, and often afforded lodging to travellers, whom darkness or tempests
happened to overtake.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,106.260

The hermit sat on a bench at the door, to enjoy the coolness of the
evening.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,106.261

On one side lay a book with pens and paper; on the other mechanical
instruments of various kinds.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,106.262

As they approached him unregarded, the princess observed that he had
not the countenance of a man that had found, or could teach, the way
to happiness.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,106.263

They saluted him with great respect, which he repaid like a man not
unaccustomed to the forms of courts.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,106.264

"My children, <P_1,107> said he, if you have lost your way, you shall be
willingly supplied with such conveniencies for the night as this cavern
will afford.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.265

I have all that Nature requires, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.266

and you will not expect delicacies in a hermit's cell. "
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.267

They thanked him, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.268

and, entering, were pleased with the neatness and regularity of the place.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.269

The hermit set flesh and wine before them, though he fed only upon fruits
and water.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.270

His discourse was cheerful without levity, and pious without enthusiasm.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.271

He soon gained the esteem of his guests, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.272

and the princess repented of her hasty censure.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.273

At last Imlac began thus: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.274

"I do not now wonder that your reputation is so far extended;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.275

we have heard at Cairo of your wisdom, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.276

and came hither to implore your direction for this young man and maiden
in the <font> choice of life. "<$$font> JOHNSON-1759-2,1,107.277

<P_1,108>

"To him that lives well, answered the hermit, every form of life is good;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.279

nor can I give any other rule for choice, than to remove from all apparent
evil. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.280

"He will remove most certainly from evil, said the prince, who shall
devote himself to that solitude which you have recommended by your
example. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.281

"I have indeed lived fifteen years in solitude, said the hermit,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.282

but have no desire that my example should gain any imitators.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.283

In my youth I professed arms, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.284

and was raised by degrees to the highest military rank.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.285

I have traversed wide countries at the head of my troops, and seen many
battles and sieges.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.286

At last, being disgusted by the preferment of a younger officer, and
feeling my vigour beginning to decay, I resolved to close my life in
peace, having found the world full of snares, discord, and misery.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,108.287

I had once escaped from the pursuit of the enemy by the <P_1,109>
shelter of this cavern, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.288

and therefore chose it for my final residence.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.289

I employed artificers to form it into chambers, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.290

and stored it with all that I was likely to want.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.291

"For some time after my retreat I rejoiced like a tempest-beaten
sailor at his entrance into the harbour, being delighted with the
sudden change of the noise and hurry of war, to stillness and repose.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.292

When the pleasure of novelty went away, I employed my hours in examining
the plants which grow in the valley, and the minerals which I collected
from the rocks.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.293

But that inquiry is now grown tasteless and irksome.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.294

I have been for some time unsettled and distracted:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.295

my mind is disturbed with a thousand perplexities of doubt, and
vanities of imagination, which hourly prevail upon me, because I have
no opportunities of relaxation or diversion.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.296

I am sometimes ashamed to think that I could not secure myself from vice,
but by retiring from the exercise of virtue, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,109.297

and begin <P_1,110> to suspect that I was rather impelled by resentment,
than led by devotion, into solitude.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.298

My fancy riots in scenes of folly, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.299

and I lament that I have lost so much, and have gained so little.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.300

In solitude, if I escape the example of bad men, I want likewise the
counsel and conversation of the good.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.301

I have been long comparing the evils with the advantages of society,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.302

and resolve to return into the world to-morrow.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.303

The life of a solitary man will be certainly miserable, but not certainly
devout. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.304

They heard his resolution with surprise, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.305

but, after a short pause, offered to conduct him to Cairo.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.306

He dug up a considerable treasure which he had hid among the rocks,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.307

and accompanied them to the city, on which, as he approached it, he
gazed with rapture.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,110.308

Chap. XXII.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.311

The happiness of a life led according to nature.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.312

<$$heading>

Rasselas went often to an assembly of learned men, who met at
stated times to unbend their minds, and compare their opinions.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.314

Their manners were somewhat coarse, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.315

but their conversation was instructive, and their disputations acute,
though sometimes too violent, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.316

and often continued till neither controvertist remembered upon what
question they began.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.317

Some faults were almost general among them: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.318

every one was desirous to dictate to the rest, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.319

and every one was pleased to hear the genius or knowledge of another
depreciated.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,111.320

In this assembly Rasselas was relating his interview with the hermit,
and the wonder <P_1,112> with which he heard him censure a course of
life which he had so deliberately chosen, and so laudably followed.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.321

The sentiments of the hearers were various.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.322

Some were of opinion, that the folly of his choice had been
justly punished by condemnation to perpetual perseverance.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.323

One of the youngest among them, with great vehemence, pronounced him
a hypocrite.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.324

Some talked of the right of society to the labour of individuals,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.325

and considered retirement as a desertion of duty.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.326

Others readily allowed, that there was a time when the claims of the
publick were satisfied, and when a man might properly sequester himself,
to review his life, and purify his heart.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,112.327

One, who appeared more affected with the narrative than the rest,
thought it likely that the hermit would, in a few years, go back to his
retreat, and, perhaps, if shame did not restrain, or death intercept
him, return once more from his retreat into the <P_1,113> world:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.328

"For the hope of happiness, said he, is so strongly impressed that the
longest experience is not able to efface it.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.329

Of the present state, whatever it be, we feel, and are forced to confess,
the misery, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.330

yet, when the same state is again at a distance, imagination paints it
as desirable.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.331

But the time will surely come, when desire will no longer be our
torment, and no man shall be wretched but by his own fault. "
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.332

"This, said a philosopher who had heard him with tokens of
great impatience, is the present condition of a wise man.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.333

The time is already come when none are wretched but by their own fault.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.334

Nothing is more idle, than to inquire after happiness, which nature has
kindly placed within our reach.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,113.335

The way to be happy is to live according to nature, in obedience to
that universal and unalterable law with which every heart is originally
impressed; which is not written on it by precept, but engraven by destiny,
not <P_1,114> instilled by education, but infused at our nativity.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.336

He that lives according to nature, will suffer nothing from the delusions
of hope, or importunities of desire: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.337

he will receive and reject with equability of temper; and act
or suffer as the reason of things shall alternately prescribe.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.338

Other men may amuse themselves with subtle definitions or intricate
raciocination.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.339

Let them learn to be wise by easier means: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.340

let them observe the hind of the forest, and the linnet of the grove:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.341

let them consider the life of animals, whose motions are regulated by
instinct; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.342

they obey their guide JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.343

and are happy.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.344

Let us therefore, at length, cease to dispute, and learn to live; throw
away the encumbrance of precepts, which they who utter them with so
much pride and pomp do not understand, and carry with us this simple
and intelligible maxim, That deviation from nature is deviation from
happiness. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,114.345

<P_1,115>

When he had spoken, he looked round him with a placid air,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.347

and enjoyed the consciousness of his own beneficence.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.348

"Sir, said the prince with great modesty, as I, like all the rest of
mankind, am desirous of felicity, my closest attention has been fixed
upon your discourse: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.349

I doubt not the truth of a position which a man so learned has so
confidently advanced.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.350

Let me only know what it is to live according to Nature. "
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.351

"When I find young men so humble and so docile, said the philosopher ,
I can deny them no information which my studies have enabled me to afford.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.352

To live according to nature, is to act always with due regard to the
fitness arising from the relations and qualities of causes and effects;
to concur with the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity;
to co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of the present
system of things. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,115.353

<P_1,116>

The prince soon found that this was one of the sages whom he should
understand less as he heard him longer.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.355

He therefore bowed JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.356

and was silent, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.357

and the philosopher, supposing him satisfied, and the rest vanquished,
rose up JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.358

and departed with the air of a man that had co-operated with the present
system.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.359

Rasselas returned home full of reflexions, doubting how to direct his
future steps.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.364

Of the way to happiness he found the learned and simple equally ignorant
; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.365

but, as he was yet young, he flattered himself that he had time remaining
for more experiments, and further inquiries.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,116.366

He <P_1,117> communicated to Imlac his observations and his doubts,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.367

but was answered by him with new doubts, and remarks that gave him
no comfort.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.368

He therefore discoursed more frequently and freely with his sister,
who had yet the same hope with himself, and always assisted him to give
some reason why, though he had been hitherto frustrated, he might succeed
at last.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.369

"We have hitherto, said she, known but little of the world:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.370

we have never yet been either great or mean.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.371

In our own country, though we had royalty, we had no power,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.372

and in this we have not yet seen the private recesses of domestic peace.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.373

Imlac favours not our search, lest we should in time find him mistaken.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.374

We will divide the task between us: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.375

you shall try what is to be found in the splendour of courts,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.376

and I will range the shades of humbler life.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,117.377

Perhaps command and authority may be the supreme blessings, as they afford
the most opportunities <P_1,118> of doing good: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,118.378

or, perhaps, what this world can give may be found in the modest
habitations of middle fortune; too low for great designs, and too high
for penury and distress. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,118.379

Rasselas applauded the design, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,118.384

and appeared next day with a splendid retinue at the court of the Bassa.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,118.385

He was soon distinguished for his magnificence, and admitted, as a prince
whose curiosity had brought him from distant countries, to an intimacy
with the great officers and frequent conversation with the Bassa himself.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,118.386

He was at first inclined to believe that the man must be pleased with
his own condition, whom all approached with reverence, and heard with
obedience, and who had the <P_1,119> power to extend his edicts to a
whole kingdom.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,119.387

"There can be no pleasure, said he, equal to that of feeling at
once the joy of thousands all made happy by wise administration.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,119.388

Yet, since, by the law of subordination, this sublime delight can be
in one nation but the lot of one, it is surely reasonable to think that
there is some satisfaction more popular and accessible, and that millions
can hardly be subjected to the will of a single man , only to fill his
particular breast with incommunicable content.  "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,119.389

These thoughts were often in his mind, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,119.390

and he found no solution of the difficulty.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,119.391

But as presents and civilities gained him more familiarity, he found that
almost every man who stood high in his employment hated all the rest,
and was hated by them, and that their lives were a continual succession
of plots and detections, stratagems and escapes, faction and treachery.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,119.392

Many of those who surrounded the Bassa, were sent only to watch and
<P_1,120> report his conduct; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.393

every tongue was muttering censure, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.394

and every eye was searching for a fault.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.395

At last the letters of revocation arrived, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.396

the Bassa was carried in chains to Constantinople,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.397

and his name was mentioned no more.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.398

"What are we now to think of the prerogatives of power?  said Rasselas
to his sister; JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.399

is it without efficacy to good?  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.400

or, is the subordinate degree only dangerous, and the supreme safe
and glorious?  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.401

Is the Sultan the only happy man in his dominions,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.402

or is the Sultan himself subject to the torments of suspicion and the
dread of enemies? "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.403

In a short time the second Bassa was deposed.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,120.404

The Sultan, that had advanced him, was murdered by the Janisaries,

The princess pursues her inquiry with more diligence than success.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.410

The princess, in the meantime, insinuated herself into many families;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.412

for there are few doors through which liberality, joined with good humour,
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} find its way.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.413

The daughters of many houses were airy and chearful;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.414

but Nekayah had been too long accustomed to the conversation of Imlac
and her brother to be much pleased with childish levity and prattle
which had no meaning.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.415

She found their thoughts narrow, their wishes low, and their merriment
often artificial.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.416

Their pleasures, poor as they were, could not be preserved pure,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.417

but were embittered by petty competitions and worthless emulation.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,121.418

They were always jealous of the beauty of each other; of a quality to
which solicitude can add nothing, and from which <P_1,122> detraction
can take nothing away.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.419

Many were in love with triflers like themselves, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.420

and many fancied that they were in love when in truth they were only idle.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.421

Their affection was seldom fixed on sense or virtue,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.422

and therefore seldom ended but in vexation.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.423

Their grief, however, like their joy, was transient;
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.424

every thing floated in their mind unconnected with the past or future
, so that one desire easily gave way to another, as a second stone
cast into the water effaces and confounds the circles of the first.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.425

With these girls she played as with inoffensive animals,
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.426

and found them proud of her countenance, and weary of her company.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.427

But her purpose was to examine more deeply, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.428

and her affability easily persuaded the hearts that were swelling with
sorrow to discharge their secrets in her ear: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,122.429

and those whom hope flattered, or prosperity delighted, <P_1,123> often
courted her to partake their pleasure.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.430

The princess and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private
summerhouse on the banks of the Nile, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.431

and related to each other the occurrences of the day.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.432

As they were sitting together, the princess cast her eyes upon the river
that flowed before her.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.433

"Answer, said she, great father of waters, thou that rollest thy goods
through eighty nations, to the invocations of the daughter of thy
native king.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.434

Tell me if thou waterest, through all thy course, a single
habitation from which thou dost not hear the murmurs of complaint.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.435

"You are then, said Rasselas, not more successful in private houses than
I have been in courts. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,123.436

"I have, since the last partition of our provinces, said the princess,
enabled myself to enter familiarly into many families, where there was the
fairest show of <P_1,124> prosperity and peace, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.437

and know not one house that is not haunted by some fury that destroys
their quiet.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.438

"I did not seek ease among the poor, because I concluded that there it
could not be found.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.439

But I saw many poor whom I had supposed to live in affluence.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.440

Poverty has, in large cities, very different appearances:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.441

it is often concealed in splendour, and often in extravagance.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.442

It is the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence
from the rest: JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.443

they support themselves by temporary expedients, JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.444

and every day is lost in contriving for the morrow.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.445

"This, however, was an evil which, though frequent, I saw with less pain,
because I could relieve it.  JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.446

Yet some have refused my bounties; more offended with my quickness to
detect their wants, than pleased with my readiness to succour them:
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,124.447

and others, whose exigencies compelled them to <P_1,125> admit
my kindness, have never been able to forgive their benefactress.
JOHNSON-1759-2,1,125.448

Many, however, have been sincerely grateful without the ostentation of
gratitude, or the hope of other favours. "JOHNSON-1759-2,1,125.449

Chap. XXVI.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,129.452

The princess continues her remarks upon private life.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,129.453

<$$heading>

Nekayah perceiving her brother's attention fixed, proceeded in her
narrative.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,129.455

"In families, where there is or is not poverty, there is commonly discord:
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,129.456

if a kingdom be, as Imlac tells us, a great family, a family likewise is
a little kingdom, torn with <P_2,130> factions and exposed to revolutions.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.457

An unpractised observer expects the love of parents and children to be
constant and equal; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.458

but this kindness seldom continues beyond the years of infancy:
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.459

in a short time the children become rivals to their parents.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.460

Benefits are allowed by reproaches, and gratitude debased by envy.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.461

"Parents and children seldom act in concert: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.462

each child endeavours to appropriate the esteem or the fondness of the
parents, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.463

and the parents, with yet less temptation, betray each other to their
children; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.464

thus some place their confidence in the father, and some in the mother ,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.465

and by degrees the house is filled with artifices and feuds.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.466

"The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the old, are
naturally opposite, by the contrary effects of hope and despondency,
of expectation and experience, without crime or folly on either side.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,130.467

The <P_2,131> colours of life in youth and age appear different, as the
face of nature in spring and winter.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.468

And how can children credit the assertions of parents, which their own
eyes show them to be false?  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.469

"Few parents act in such a manner as much to enforce their maxims by
the credit of their lives.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.470

The old man trusts wholly to slow contrivance and gradual progression:
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.471

the youth expects to force his way by genius, vigour, and precipitance.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.472

The old man pays regard to riches, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.473

and the youth reverences virtue.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.474

The old man deifies prudence: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.475

the youth commits himself to magnanimity and chance.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.476

The young man, who intends no ill, believes that none is intended,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.477

and therefore acts with openness and candour: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.478

but his father, having suffered the injuries of fraud, is impelled to
suspect, and too often allured to practise it.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.479

Age looks with anger on the temerity of youth, and youth with contempt
on the scrupulosity of age.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,131.480

Thus parents and children, for <P_2,132> the greatest part, live on to
love less and less: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.481

and if those whom nature has thus closely united are the torments
of each other, where shall we look for tenderness and consolations?
"JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.482

"Surely, said the prince, you must have been unfortunate in your choice
of acquaintance: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.483

I am unwilling to believe, that the most tender of all relations is thus
impeded in its effects by natural necessity. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.484

"Domestic discord, answered she, is not inevitably and fatally necessary;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.485

but yet is not easily avoided.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.486

We seldom see that a whole family is virtuous: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.487

the good and the evil $can $not {TEXT:cannot} well agree,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.488

and the evil can yet less agree with one another: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.489

even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance, when their virtues are of
different kinds, and tending to extremes.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.490

In general, those parents have most reverence who most deserve it:
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.491

for he that lives well $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be despised.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,132.492

<P_2,133>

Many other evils infest private life.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.494

Some are the slaves of servants whom they have trusted with their affairs.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.495

Some are kept in continual anxiety by the caprice of rich relations
, whom they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} please, and dare not offend.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.496

Some husbands are imperious, and some wives perverse:
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.497

and, as it is always more easy to do evil than good, though the wisdom
or virtue of one can very rarely make many happy, the folly or vice of
one makes many miserable. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.498

"If such be the general effect of marriage, said the prince, I shall for
the future think it dangerous to connect my interest with that of another,
lest I should be unhappy by my partner's fault.  "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.499

"I have met, said the princess, with many who live single for that reason;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.500

but I never found that their prudence ought to raise envy.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,133.501

They dream away their time without friendship, <P_2,134> without fondness
, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.502

and are driven to rid themselves of the day, for which they have no use,
by childish amusements, or vicious delights.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.503

They act as beings under the constant sense of some known inferiority,
that fills their minds with rancour, and their tongues with censure.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.504

They are peevish at home, and malevolent abroad; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.505

and, as the out-laws of human nature, make it their business and their
pleasure to disturb that society which debars them from its privileges.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.506

To live without feeling or exciting sympathy, to be fortunate without
adding to the felicity of others, or afflicted without tasting the balm
of pity, is a state more gloomy than solitude: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.507

it is not retreat but exclusion from mankind.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.508

Marriage has many pains, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.509

but celibacy has no pleasures. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.510

"What then is to be done?  said Rasselas: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.511

the more we enquire, the less we can resolve.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.512

Surely he is most likely to please himself that has no other inclination
to regard. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,134.513

Chap. XXVII.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.516

Disquisition upon greatness.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.517

<$$heading>

The conversation had a short pause.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.519

The prince, having considered his sister's observation, told her, that
she had surveyed life with prejudice, and supposed misery where she did
not find it.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.520

"Your narrative, says he, throws yet a darker gloom upon the prospects
of futurity: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.521

the predictions of Imlac were but faint sketches of the evils painted
by Nekayah.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.522

I have been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of grandeur ,
or of power; that her presence is not to be bought by wealth, nor enforced
by conquest.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.523

It is evident, that as any man acts in a wider compass, he must be
more exposed to opposition from enmity, or miscarriage from chance;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,135.524

whoever has many to please or to govern, must use the ministry of
many agents, some of whom <P_2,136> will be wicked, and some ignorant;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.525

by some he will be misled, and by others betrayed.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.526

If he gratifies one he will offend another: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.527

those that are not favoured will think themselves injured;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.528

and, since favours can be conferred but upon few, the greater number
will be always discontented. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.529

"The discontent, said the princess, which is thus unreasonable, I hope
that I shall always have spirit to despise, and you, power to repress.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.530

"Discontent, answered Rasselas, will not always be without reason
under the most just and vigilant administration of publick affairs.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.531

None, however attentive, can always discover that merit which indigence
or faction may happen to obscure; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.532

and none however powerful can always reward it.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.533

Yet, he that sees inferior desert advanced above him will naturally
impute that preference to partiality or caprice; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,136.534

and, indeed, <P_2,137> it can scarcely be hoped that any man, however
magnanimous by nature, or exalted by condition, will be able to
persist for ever in fixed and inexorable justice of distribution:
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.535

he will sometimes indulge his own affections, and sometimes those of
his favourites; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.536

he will permit some to please him, who can never serve him;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.537

he will discover in those whom he loves, qualities which in reality they
do not possess; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.538

and to those, from whom he receives pleasure, he will in his turn
endeavour to give it.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.539

Thus will recommendations sometimes prevail which were purchased by
money, or by the more destructive bribery of flattery and servility.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.540

"He that hath much to do will do something wrong, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.541

and of that wrong must suffer the consequences; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,137.542

and if it were possible that he should always act rightly, yet when
such numbers are to judge of his conduct, the bad will censure and
obstruct him by malevolence <P_2,138> and the good sometimes by mistake.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,138.543

"The highest stations $can $not {TEXT:cannot} therefore hope to be the
abodes of happiness, which I would willingly believe to have fled from
thrones and palaces to seats of humble privacy and placid obscurity.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,138.544

For what can hinder the satisfaction, or intercept the expectations,
of him whose abilities are adequate to his employments, who sees with
his own eyes the whole circuit of his influence, who chooses by his own
knowledge all whom he trusts, and whom none are tempted to deceive by
hope or fear?  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,138.545

Surely he has nothing to do but to love and to be loved, to be virtuous
and to be happy. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,138.546

"Whether perfect happiness would be procured by perfect goodness,
said Nekayah, this world will never afford an opportunity of deciding.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,138.547

But this, at least, may be maintained, that we do not always
find <P_2,139> visible happiness in proportion to visible virtue.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.548

All natural and almost all political evils, are incident alike to the
bad and good: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.549

they are confounded in the misery of a famine, and not much distinguished
in the fury of a faction; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.550

they sink together in a tempest, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.551

and are driven together from their country by invaders.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.552

All that virtue can afford is quietness of conscience, a steady prospect
of a happier state; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.553

this may enable us to endure calamity with patience;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.554

but remember that patience must suppose pain. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.555

Chap. XXVIII.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.557

Rasselas and Nekayah continue their conversation.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,139.558

<$$heading>

"Dear princess, said Rasselas, you fall into the common errors of
exaggeratory declamation, by producing, in a familiar disquisition,
examples of national calamities and scenes of extensive <P_2,140>
misery, which are found in books rather than in the world, and which,
as they are horrid, are ordained to be rare.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.560

Let us not imagine evils which we do not feel, nor injure life by
misrepresentations.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.561

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear that querulous eloquence which threatens
every city with a siege like that of Jerusalem, that makes famine attend
on every flight of locusts, and suspends pestilence on the wing of every
blast that issues from the south.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.562

"On necessary and inevitable evils which overwhelm kingdoms at once,
all disputation is vain: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.563

when they happen they must be endured.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.564

But it is evident, that these bursts of universal distress are more
dreaded than felt; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.565

thousands and tens of thousands flourish in youth,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.566

and wither in age, without the knowledge of any other than domestick
evils, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,140.567

and share the same pleasures and vexations whether their kings are mild
or cruel, whether the armies of their country pursue their <P_2,141>
enemies or retreat before them.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.568

While courts are disturbed with intestine competitions, and embassadors
are negotiating in foreign countries, the smith still plies his anvil,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.569

and the husbandman drives his plough forward; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.570

the necessaries of life are required and obtained,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.571

and the successive business of the season continues to make its wonted
revolutions.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.572

"Let us cease to consider what perhaps, may never happen, and
what, when it shall happen, will laugh at human speculation.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.573

We will not endeavour to modify the motions of the elements, or to fix
the destiny of kingdoms.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.574

It is our business to consider what beings like us may perform; each
labouring for his own happiness by promoting within his circle, however
narrow, the happiness of others.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.575

"Marriage is evidently the dictate of nature; JOHNSON-1759-2,2,141.576

men and women were made to be the companions <P_2,142> of each other,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,142.577

and therefore I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be persuaded but that marriage
is one of the means of happiness. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,142.578

"I know not, said the princess, whether marriage be more than one of
the innumerable modes of human misery.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,142.579

When I see and reckon the various forms of connubial infelicity, the
unexpected causes of lasting discord, the diversities of temper, the
oppositions of opinion, the rude collisions of contrary desire where
both are urged by violent impulses, the obstinate contest of disagreeing
virtues, where both are supported by consciousness of good intention, I
am sometimes disposed to think with the severer casuists of most nations
, that marriage is rather permitted than approved, and that none, but
by the instigation of a passion too much indulged, entangle themselves
with indissoluble compact. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,142.580

<P_2,143>

"You seem to forget, replied Rasselas, that you have, even
now, represented celibacy as less happy than marriage.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.582

Both conditions may be bad, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.583

but they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} both be worst.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.584

Thus it happens when wrong opinions are entertained, that they
mutually destroy each other, and leave the mind open to truth.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.585

"I did not expect, answered the princess, to hear that
imputed to falsehood which is the consequence only of frailty.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.586

To the mind, as to the eye, it is difficult to compare with
exactness objects vast in their extent, and various in their parts.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.587

When we see or conceive the whole at once, we readily note the
discriminations JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.588

and decide the preference: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,143.589

but of two systems, of which neither can be surveyed by any human being in
its full compass of magnitude and multiplicity of complication, where is
the wonder, that judging of the whole by parts, I am alternately affected
by one or <P_2,144> the other as either presses on my memory or fancy?
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.590

We differ from ourselves just as we differ from each other, when we see
only part of the question, as in the multifarious relations of politicks
and morality: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.591

but when we perceive the whole at once, as in numerical computations,
all agree in one judgment, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.592

and none ever varies in his opinion. "JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.593

"Let us not add, said the prince, to the other evils of life, the
bitterness of controversy, nor endeavour to vie with each other in
subtilties of argument.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.594

We are employed in a search, $of {TEXT:"of"_missing} which both
are equally to enjoy the success or suffer by the miscarriage.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.595

It is therefore fit that we assist each other.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.596

You surely conclude too hastily from the infelicity of marriage against
its institution.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.597

Will not the misery of life prove equally that life $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be the gift of heaven?  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.598

The world must be peopled by marriage, or peopled without it.
"JOHNSON-1759-2,2,144.599

<P_2,145>

"How the world is to be peopled, returned Nekayah, is not my care
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.601

and need not be yours.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.602

I see no danger that the present generation should omit to leave
successors behind them: JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.603

we are not now inquiring for the world, but for ourselves. "

Chap. XXIX.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.606

The debate on marriage continued.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.607

<$$heading>

"The good of the whole, says Rasselas, is the same with the good of all
its parts.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.609

If marriage be best for mankind it must be evidently best for individuals
, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.610

or a permanent and necessary duty must be the cause of evil,
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.611

and some must be inevitably sacrificed to the convenience of others.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,145.612

In the estimate which you have made of the two states, it appears that
the incommodities of a single life are, in a great measure <P_2,146>
necessary and certain, but those of the conjugal state accidental and
avoidable.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.613

"I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forbear to flatter myself that prudence and
benevolence will make marriage happy.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.614

The general folly of mankind is the cause of general complaint.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.615

What can be expected but disappointment and repentance from a choice made
in the immaturity of youth, in the ardour of desire, without judgment
, without foresight, without inquiry after conformity of opinions,
similarity of manners, rectitude of judgment, or purity of sentiment?
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.616

"Such is the common process of marriage.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.617

A youth and maiden, meeting by chance or brought together by artifice,
exchange glances, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.618

reciprocate civilities, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.619

go home, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.620

and dream of one another.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.621

Having little to divert attention, or diversify thought, they find
themselves uneasy when they are apart, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,146.622

and therefore conclude that they shall be <P_2,147> happy together.
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,147.623

They marry, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,147.624

and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness before had concealed;
JOHNSON-1759-2,2,147.625

they wear out life in altercations, JOHNSON-1759-2,2,147.626

and charge nature with cruelty.  JOHNSON-1759-2,2,147.627
