<P_133>

<heading>

<font> Aix la Chapelle.  <$$font> <$$heading> The entrance to which is
very indifferent, ANON4-1791-2,133.3

on each side of you the most wretched, dirty hovels I ever beheld -
ANON4-1791-2,133.4

Aix lies very low, and, in my opinion, damp, though the inhabitants
will not allow it, the medical tribe <P_134> especially, who are here
in great numbers, and extol the salubrity of the air - ANON4-1791-2,134.5

As you advance further into the town the streets get broader,
ANON4-1791-2,134.6

and you see some very good houses; ANON4-1791-2,134.7

yet, what is extraordinary, you do not see one street, in the whole city,
regularly built - ANON4-1791-2,134.8

This place is not, in general, much frequented by the English;
ANON4-1791-2,134.9

this year, however, owing to the aforementioned quarrel at Spa, it was
remarkably full of English - ANON4-1791-2,134.10

The Poles, Swedes, Germans, and Russians, make this their watering place,
as the more Southern nations do Spa - ANON4-1791-2,134.11

The season is at the height six weeks before the commencement of the
Spa season, and six weeks after its conclusion; ANON4-1791-2,134.12

there is, however, a great deal of company here from May to October -
ANON4-1791-2,134.13

In favour of the amusements of the place I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
say much - ANON4-1791-2,134.14

I am sorry to observe, that, like Spa, it is chiefly calculated
for a description of men not the most honourable, <P_135> who
found the structure of their own happiness on the ruin of others;
ANON4-1791-2,135.15

it is almost needless, after this, to describe them under the name of
Gamesters - ANON4-1791-2,135.16

From morning to night your ears are incessantly dinned with the rattling
of the dice-box, ANON4-1791-2,135.17

not an hour but is employed in cards or dice - ANON4-1791-2,135.18

There are settled hours for every game, beyond which they $can $not
{TEXT:cannnot} play at {COM:see_errata} it - ANON4-1791-2,135.19

yet, as soon as one Bank shuts, another opens; ANON4-1791-2,135.20

and to those, who are only actuated by the avaritious motive of possessing
more than they already have, <paren> for as to pleasure, I can allow no
gamester to enjoy any, whilst his mind is thus agitated by the different
emotions of hope and fear, <$$paren> it matters very little at what game
he hazards his money, provided the chances are equal - ANON4-1791-2,135.21

Biribi, Hazard, Faro, Trent-un, each have their respective turns in the
day, ANON4-1791-2,135.22

and are most under the direction of a distinct person.
ANON4-1791-2,135.23

- The chief Banker <P_136> here pays a thousand Louis <font> per annum
<$$font> for his licence during the season; ANON4-1791-2,136.24

and it is said, that his profit in general exceeds four thousand, and
sometimes double that sum - ANON4-1791-2,136.25

There are two gaming-houses a mile or two from the town, to which at
stated hours all the gamblers resort - ANON4-1791-2,136.26

Indeed, I know no police more regularly <paren> I will not say better
<$$paren> governed than this - ANON4-1791-2,136.27

Each gaming house, each room, nay, each part of a room, has its
peculiar hour, two only of which, from the commencement of play to the
conclusion <paren> which is from ten in the morning to two or three
the next <$$paren> are allotted for meals, and often not one employed.
ANON4-1791-2,136.28

- When I was at Aix, there was a little Italian, who, within a fortnight,
had undergone as many revolutions of fortune, as in general fall to
the lot of the most extraordinary gamester during his whole life -
ANON4-1791-2,136.29

He came there, as an adventurer, with a <P_137> few Louis d'Ors in his
pockets, determined to try the favour of Fortune - ANON4-1791-2,137.30

his first attempt was at Hazard, where he played crown stakes, and,
as Fortune kindly smiled on him, increased to an half guinea, guinea,
and so on, to Bank notes.  ANON4-1791-2,137.31

- In the space of twenty-four hours, he had stripped the Bank of upwards
of four thousand pounds, ANON4-1791-2,137.32

and the next morning, resuming his operations, broke the Bank
entirely, his winnings amounting to more than nine thousand pounds -
ANON4-1791-2,137.33

One would have imagined, that a poor needy adventurer, who, most probably,
had never seen a twentieth part of such a sum before, would have packed
up his all immediately, and returned <paren> in his own mind a prince
<$$paren> to his native country - ANON4-1791-2,137.34

Content, however, was a stranger to his mind, ANON4-1791-2,137.35

and the accession of one sum only brought with it anxiety for a greater
- ANON4-1791-2,137.36

For several days, however, the Bankers could not play, so <P_138>
completely had he reduced them to their last stake - ANON4-1791-2,138.37

A supply of cash, however, at last arrived, which enabled them to open
a fresh campaign.  ANON4-1791-2,138.38

- Our little adventurer, as usual, stuck close to them;
ANON4-1791-2,138.39

and, for a few hours, his usual success attended him.  ANON4-1791-2,138.40

- The tables, however, at last turned on him, ANON4-1791-2,138.41

and, from being the possessor of ten thousand pounds, he left the Bank
reduced to his very last Louis - ANON4-1791-2,138.42

When he reached his lodging, he could not help taking a retrospective
view of his conduct.  ANON4-1791-2,138.43

- How did he bewail his situation!  how lament that he had not been
content with his former gain, and retired to his own country, to enjoy
the fruits of his success!  ANON4-1791-2,138.44

- To complain, however, of his situation could not mend it;
ANON4-1791-2,138.45

convinced of this, he determined to make one more vigorous effort to
recover the money he had lost; fully, however, in his own mind determined
to leave Aix directly, if Fortune <P_139> should once more smile upon
him - ANON4-1791-2,139.46

yet, how to raise money sufficient to put himself into the fickle Jade's
way, he could not tell - ANON4-1791-2,139.47

At last, however, he recollected a friend, whom he had assisted in
several emergencies, and who resided only a few miles distant from the
city - ANON4-1791-2,139.48

To him he immediately dispatched a messenger with a request of the loan
of thirty pounds - ANON4-1791-2,139.49

This was immediately complied with, ANON4-1791-2,139.50

and our little Italian returned to the gaming-table, much to the
discomfort of the Bankers, who, from the success that attended his play,
had conceived no small dread of him - ANON4-1791-2,139.51

His usual run of good luck attended him, ANON4-1791-2,139.52

and, from being master of only thirty pounds, he left the table with
more than ten thousand, ANON4-1791-2,139.53

and not forgetting the resolution he had formed in his fit of poverty,
retired to an inn, ANON4-1791-2,139.54

ordered a carriage, ANON4-1791-2,139.55

and packed up his baggage - ANON4-1791-2,139.56

In the interim, however, one <P_140> of the Directors of the Bank,
learning his intention, set off immediately to him, resolved to use all
the rhetoric he was master of, to persuade him to relinquish his design
- ANON4-1791-2,140.57

His arguments were too specious not to destroy the resolution of the
poor Italian; ANON4-1791-2,140.58

his fortitude vanished in a moment, ANON4-1791-2,140.59

and, instead of returning to his native country, he returned to the
gaming-table, where, in a very few hours, he was stripped of every sol
he had in the world, and left to reflect on the diversity of Fortune,
which he had known in the space of so short a time - ANON4-1791-2,140.60

The moment he returned to his lodgings he sold the greatest part of his
clothes, ANON4-1791-2,140.61

and by this means raised a few Louis, ANON4-1791-2,140.62

and returned to his own haunt in a more humble line than before.
ANON4-1791-2,140.63

- When I left Aix, he had by half-crown stakes so far retrieved his
affairs, as to repay the thirty pounds he had borrowed of his friend,
and to be ambitious of increasing <P_141> his stake - ANON4-1791-2,141.64

I never heard whether success again attended him, ANON4-1791-2,141.65

nor, from his avarice and imprudence, was I much interested in his fate.
ANON4-1791-2,141.66

The rides and walks round Aix are but very indifferent, and the roads,
when compared with those of Spa, most wretched - ANON4-1791-2,141.67

There are two balls a week at the Redoute, where the gaming tables are
kept - ANON4-1791-2,141.68

English country dances are allowed, ANON4-1791-2,141.69

but, in general, the dancing consists of a minuet or two, cotillions,
and a Polish dance - ANON4-1791-2,141.70

This last is performed by two persons, ANON4-1791-2,141.71

and is, in some respects, similar to our <font> Minuet de la Cour
<$$font>, only rather more grave and solemn; ANON4-1791-2,141.72

the performers are continually crossing each other at right angles,
ANON4-1791-2,141.73

and, upon the whole, it is not to the spectators the most pleasing dance
in the world - ANON4-1791-2,141.74

I saw two daughters of the Grand Mayor of the town dance it -
ANON4-1791-2,141.75

they seemed very pleasing, shewy women - ANON4-1791-2,141.76

as soon as <P_142> they had finished it, the company expressed their
approbation in the same manner we do to our actors and actresses in
London, by clapping their hands - ANON4-1791-2,142.77

In the Redoute the music is very good - ANON4-1791-2,142.78

The moment one set has done dancing, another starts up, and sometimes
only one couple, unasked and without ceremony - ANON4-1791-2,142.79

They are, at present, building a New Redoute, and Come`die all in one,
on the plan of the Spa Old Redoute, part of which tumbles occasionally
into a play-house - ANON4-1791-2,142.80

This New Redoute at Aix is close to the old one, ANON4-1791-2,142.81

it was begun by a jeweller, who lives on the spot, but who, for
want of money, has been obliged to dispose of it half finished;
ANON4-1791-2,142.82

when completed, I dare say, it will be a most capital building -
ANON4-1791-2,142.83

The concert is another amusement here, ANON4-1791-2,142.84

they are held only once a week - the performers, some good and some bad;
ANON4-1791-2,142.85

they are, in general, but thinly attended - ANON4-1791-2,142.86

The <P_143> Come`die is much frequented by the independent gentry
, by which I mean, those who are not professedly gamesters.
ANON4-1791-2,143.87

- The language is German, consequently rather harsh to the ear -
ANON4-1791-2,143.88

The dancing is, however, very good - ANON4-1791-2,143.89

You meet at Aix such a quantity of nobility, of Princes, Counts,
Barons, &c. that you rather fancy yourself at court, than at a
bathing-place - ANON4-1791-2,143.90

Honours, in Germany, are not very difficult to obtain, ANON4-1791-2,143.91

and are to be purchased with money - ANON4-1791-2,143.92

A very humorous droll fellow, whom I met at Aix, gave me the reputed
price of most German distinctions of rank - ANON4-1791-2,143.93

Barons he rated at fifty Louis D'Ors; Counts <paren> real, not adopted
titles <$$paren> at one hundred; and Chamberlain <paren> which entitles
you to wear a ribband, and a key in your button-hole <$$paren> from ten
to twenty guineas, and other titles in proportion - ANON4-1791-2,143.94

I am, in some respects, inclined to give credit to my informer, though
I <P_144> make not a little allowance for his talent of ridicule -
ANON4-1791-2,144.95

After having given you some brief account of the manner of spending your
time here, <paren> and which, I am sorry to say, $can $not {TEXT:cannot},
for any continuance, give pleasure to a rational mind <$$paren> it is
necessary I should give you some account of the place itself, of its
curiosities, internal policy, &c. - ANON4-1791-2,144.96

This is a free, imperial city, ANON4-1791-2,144.97

its freedom was given to the inhabitants by the great Charlemagne,
ANON4-1791-2,144.98

and it has enjoyed it uninterruptedly ever since - ANON4-1791-2,144.99

It is governed by two Burgomasters, one of whom presides over all affairs
relative to the inhabitants of the town; the other, those of strangers -
ANON4-1791-2,144.100

The police of the city is extremely good, ANON4-1791-2,144.101

and though such a diversity of people resort here from all parts of the
world, either for health or pleasure, you seldom hear of any riot or
disturbance in the town - ANON4-1791-2,144.102

Any man may be a Bourgeois for six or seven Louis; ANON4-1791-2,144.103

without <P_145> it, though he may open a shop, he $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
sell retail - ANON4-1791-2,145.104

There are several merchants, not Burgesses, some of cloth,
ANON4-1791-2,145.105

but they must all sell by the piece - ANON4-1791-2,145.106

There are a vast number of people in Aix, miserably poor,
ANON4-1791-2,145.107

and the streets throng with wretched objects, who come from all parts of
the adjacent country for the benefit of the baths - ANON4-1791-2,145.108

Each hotel has a bath, ANON4-1791-2,145.109

you pay five skelins to go in, ANON4-1791-2,145.110

most of them are hot; one so much so, as to boil <paren> so say the
inhabitants <$$paren> an egg hard in five minutes - ANON4-1791-2,145.111

There is one cold bath - ANON4-1791-2,145.112

The baths are chiefly used in scrophulous or rheumatic cases;
ANON4-1791-2,145.113

I have also heard them recommended in paralytic disorders -
ANON4-1791-2,145.114

For one of these complaints was sent hither by her physicians the lovely
Mrs. R-n, well known in the annals of gallantry, attended by her
noble Colonel - ANON4-1791-2,145.115

I did not see her, ANON4-1791-2,145.116

but understood that she was quite a cripple, not being able to use any
of her <P_146> limbs - ANON4-1791-2,146.117

On hearing a calamity of this nature, I could scarce restrain the tear
of pity - ANON4-1791-2,146.118

The ill-natured and unfeeling world, the prude and over-chaste damsel may
laugh at, and condemn my feelings in such a cause; ANON4-1791-2,146.119

they may applaud the justice of Heaven in the exemplary punishment
bestowed on a guilty woman - ANON4-1791-2,146.120

I endeavour not even to palliate her errors, much less to dispute the
justice of the Almighty; ANON4-1791-2,146.121

yet let not us mortals be"extreme to mark what is done amiss"-
ANON4-1791-2,146.122

Let us rather endeavour to veil over the faults and crimes of our fellow
creatures, nor refuse to drop the tear of compassion, even for the woes
of a frail unhappy sister.  ANON4-1791-2,146.123

But to return to my subject - The manners of the people at Aix, are,
in general, affable, agreeable, and polite; ANON4-1791-2,146.124

the women are not famed for their modesty, or for the strictness of
their conduct - ANON4-1791-2,146.125

There were several married women who lived openly with their <P_147>
gallants; ANON4-1791-2,147.126

nor did their husbands give themselves much concern about the matter -
ANON4-1791-2,147.127

There are several curiosities in the place, which strangers are in general
shewn, as the Town-house, the Great Church, Charlemagne and his wig -
ANON4-1791-2,147.128

The first is a noble magnificent structure, ANON4-1791-2,147.129

and is situated in the Market-place - ANON4-1791-2,147.130

there are several very handsome rooms in it - ANON4-1791-2,147.131

the Magistrates meet here to transact all their business -
ANON4-1791-2,147.132

In the grand saloon are the portraits of the Ambassadors of England,
France, Germany, and Holland, who signed the famous treaty of 1748,
concluded at this place - ANON4-1791-2,147.133

They are painted by Rubens and Fourniers - ANON4-1791-2,147.134

the drapery of two or three of them is beyond description good -
ANON4-1791-2,147.135

There are paintings in several other rooms, which by no means disgrace
the artists who executed them - ANON4-1791-2,147.136

The elliptick arches to the cieling {COM:sic} of most of the rooms have
an elegant light appearance, ANON4-1791-2,147.137

and add <P_148> much to its beauty - ANON4-1791-2,148.138

The view from the Town-house over the country is very extensive -
ANON4-1791-2,148.139

The Great Church is not far from the <font> Maison de Ville <$$font>
- ANON4-1791-2,148.140

It is a fine handsome building, and the architecture very peculiar -
ANON4-1791-2,148.141

I hardly know to what order to attribute it - ANON4-1791-2,148.142

it bears most resemblance to the Ionick, ANON4-1791-2,148.143

yet rather seems to be a mixture of all - ANON4-1791-2,148.144

The choir is very rich and elegant, ANON4-1791-2,148.145

and the whole church has a pleasing air of grandeur and dignity with it
- ANON4-1791-2,148.146

There are no very capital pictures to be seen in it of consequence;
ANON4-1791-2,148.147

you have no conductor, ANON4-1791-2,148.148

but must contrive to see it whilst it is opened for divine service,
which is the greatest part of the day - ANON4-1791-2,148.149

The next object, for the notice of strangers, is Charlemagne, who,
in all the pomp of imperial dignity, is placed erect <font> <paren>
sad dire disgrace <$$paren> <$$font> in a cobwebbed closet, near the
Town-house - ANON4-1791-2,148.150

You generally give the man who shews him you $half $a $crown
{TEXT:half-a-crown}, which <P_149> $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be called a
great sum to see a great king - ANON4-1791-2,149.151

I know nothing remarkable about his august Majesty, but his wig, which
consisting of five or six hundred curls, well adjusted, and most amazingly
powdered, reminds you of Mrs. Wright's waxen image of Lord Chatham
in Westminster Abbey - ANON4-1791-2,149.152

Charlemagne is carried, thus dressed out and powdered, thrice every year
round the town, in order to imprint on the minds of the inhabitants, a due
sense of the benefits they have received from him - ANON4-1791-2,149.153

I believe it answers that effect, ANON4-1791-2,149.154

for you scarcely see any one, even the poorest person, who is not
intimately acquainted with the liberality of the Emperor, and who has
not the whole story at their {COM:changed_in_errata_to_"his"} fingers
end - ANON4-1791-2,149.155

Several go to see the prison here, ANON4-1791-2,149.156

it is a fine old building, and the different wards kept very neat and
regular; ANON4-1791-2,149.157

you seldom see many criminals, and still fewer executions;
ANON4-1791-2,149.158

all are beheaded for capital offences, though <P_150> not, I think,
with the axe - ANON4-1791-2,150.159

the dreadful torture is made use of to extort confession;
ANON4-1791-2,150.160

I know nothing else here, that would in the least gratify your curiosity
- ANON4-1791-2,150.161

It seems very extraordinary to many, that so fine a city as Aix la
Chapelle, from whence could be drawn a revenue, if properly managed,
far exceeding that of several Princes of the German empire, should have
remained thus long a free city, and totally independent of any state
whatever - ANON4-1791-2,150.162

The Emperor, or Elector Palatine, from their situation, are most likely
to take possession of it; ANON4-1791-2,150.163

yet, as to the first, though I make no doubt but he would, with the
greatest avidity, snatch every opportunity of making what addition he
could to the extensive dominions he already possesses, yet it would be
a bad system of policy for him to seize Aix - ANON4-1791-2,150.164

The inevitable consequence would be a war with France, whose claims to
this city the Emperor <P_151> knows are equally as great and just as
his own; ANON4-1791-2,151.165

and the little power and influence the Elector Palatine possesses amongst
the Princes of the Empire would be crushed and annihilated by such a
step - ANON4-1791-2,151.166

it would not only be impossible for him to preserve possession of it,
but also to defend his own dominions from the powerful, and too rapacious
hand of the Emperor - ANON4-1791-2,151.167

These are, in my opinion, the causes which have established the liberties
and independence of this city on the secure foundation which supports
it at this moment; ANON4-1791-2,151.168

nor does it seem probable it ever will exist, but as an independent
free city.  ANON4-1791-2,151.169

- I think I have now detained you long enough in this dirty town -
ANON4-1791-2,151.170

I have been longer, and more particular in my account of it, because
it is, in general, so little known to the English, as most make Spa the
extent of their tour Northward - ANON4-1791-2,151.171

I think, in the space of a very few years, Aix <P_152> la Chapelle will
be much more resorted to than it is at present - ANON4-1791-2,152.172

The improvements making in the town, and the publick building which is
going forwards, and will be by next year completed, will render it a
lively place - ANON4-1791-2,152.173

I took up my lodgings at the Hotel <font> D'Angleterre, <$$font> where I
had very good accommodations, and considering it was at a public place,
not at all extravagant - ANON4-1791-2,152.174

For every room you have you pay five skelins a night, which is very
extravagant in proportion to the other charges - ANON4-1791-2,152.175

If you purpose staying here for any length of time, the best way would
be to hire lodgings; ANON4-1791-2,152.176

you may procure very handsome ones at a Louis per week -
ANON4-1791-2,152.177

There are several very good inns at Aix, in particular that kept by
Dubigh, - <font> Table D'Hotes <$$font> at almost all of them, at which
you can dine for four skelins a head - ANON4-1791-2,152.178

There is one <paren> I forget which <$$paren> where ladies are admitted,
and mix with gentlemen - ANON4-1791-2,152.179

<P_153>

At all the <font> Table D'Hotes <$$font> they follow the French custom
of dining early, seldom later than one - ANON4-1791-2,153.181

From Aix I took a coach and four horses to Maestricht, which is six
leagues distant - ANON4-1791-2,153.182

They will ask you four, five, or six crowns, according to the season
and scarcity of horses - ANON4-1791-2,153.183

It was so full a season, that I was obliged to give six -
ANON4-1791-2,153.184

The carriages are all most miserably shabby, much inferior to the very
worst of our Hackney coaches - ANON4-1791-2,153.185

The road is but indifferent all the way - ANON4-1791-2,153.186

The country, however, is open, and fine, and the land cultivated -
ANON4-1791-2,153.187

The horses are by no means bad, ANON4-1791-2,153.188

and seldom are longer carrying you from Aix to Maestricht than three
hours - ANON4-1791-2,153.189

You may talk of coachmanship in England, ANON4-1791-2,153.190

but I never in my own country saw any thing to equal the dexterity with
which the drivers <paren> who have no box, but sit on the near hind
horse <$$paren> turn round the sharpest winding and corners of <P_154>
the streets, directing the two first horses with cords, which are used
instead of leather reins - ANON4-1791-2,154.191

You pass through no place in your way at all considerable -
ANON4-1791-2,154.192

The distance is, I think, somewhat better than three leagues.
ANON4-1791-2,154.193

<heading>

<font> Maestricht <$$font> <heading> Lies rather low -
ANON4-1791-2,154.195

you see it for more than two miles before you reach it -
ANON4-1791-2,154.196

At your entrance, the ramparts, draw-bridges, and fortifications
<paren> the last amazingly strong <$$paren> present themselves -
ANON4-1791-2,154.197

Maestricht is situated on the Maese in the province of Brabant;
ANON4-1791-2,154.198

that part of the town, which is on the West side of the river, is in
the province of Brabant, and subject to the Dutch; ANON4-1791-2,154.199

but the Wyche or Suburb, which lies on the East side of the river,
is in the Bishoprick of Liege, ANON4-1791-2,154.200

and that Prince has the civil government of it - ANON4-1791-2,154.201

The Dutch took this town from the Spaniards in 1632 - ANON4-1791-2,154.202

The French King, <P_155> however, retook it from the Dutch more than
forty years after the Spaniards had lost it to them - ANON4-1791-2,155.203

At the treaty of Nimeguen in 1679, the Dutch had it again restored to
them - ANON4-1791-2,155.204

The fortifications are now in the highest repair, ANON4-1791-2,155.205

nor do I know any place more strongly fortified both by nature and art -
ANON4-1791-2,155.206

At the time of my arrival, the inhabitants were in no little alarm from
the Emperor, as in case of the commencement of hostilities, there is no
doubt but Maestricht would, from its contiguity to the dominions of the
Emperor, be the first place attacked - ANON4-1791-2,155.207

Yet, I am well persuaded, that a small body of disciplined troops,
well provided with ammunition, stores, &c. <paren> and I am
convinced, they might with ease store themselves with twelve months
provision <$$paren> would be able to defend it against any force that
could be brought against it - ANON4-1791-2,155.208

I think myself justified in this opinion by the resistance it made
for <P_156> four or five months in 1579 against an army of 20,000 men,
commanded by an officer of the first military experience of the age in
which he lived, the Great Farnese, Duke of Parma - ANON4-1791-2,156.209

The garrison did not then exceed four thousand men, ANON4-1791-2,156.210

<paren> in 1785 there were more than four thousand most excellently
disciplined troops <$$paren> ANON4-1791-2,156.211

and half of these were newly drawn from the adjacent country - men
ignorant of military duty, and unaccustomed to hardships and distresses
; ANON4-1791-2,156.212

yet, with all these disadvantages, it was defended for the time I
have before mentioned, with incredible obstinacy and good conduct;
ANON4-1791-2,156.213

nor was it at last taken but by surprize - ANON4-1791-2,156.214

The barracks here are very good - ANON4-1791-2,156.215

there were in them seven Dutch regiments, so that the town was quite
alive - ANON4-1791-2,156.216

The troops were under the command of the Prince of Hesse Cassel , who is
governor of Maestricht, and has his residence there - ANON4-1791-2,156.217

The streets are in <P_157> general very well built, ANON4-1791-2,157.218

and there are several very good houses in appearance -
ANON4-1791-2,157.219

The <font> Grand Marche` <$$font> and the <font> Parade <$$font>
are both fine open places, and some very elegant buildings in them -
ANON4-1791-2,157.220

The civil government of the town is lodged in the Burgomaster and Schepens
- ANON4-1791-2,157.221

There are not many curiosities here which would attract the notice of
strangers; ANON4-1791-2,157.222

they shew you the Town-house, two or three churches, and the subterraneous
passage - ANON4-1791-2,157.223

As to the first, I can say very little in its praise, ANON4-1791-2,157.224

the external appearance of it is but indifferent, the internal still
worse; ANON4-1791-2,157.225

the churches are nothing capital - No very good pictures in any of them
; ANON4-1791-2,157.226

they are in general neat edifices, ANON4-1791-2,157.227

and when you have said this, you have said all - ANON4-1791-2,157.228

The subterraneous passage I had the curiosity to go and see, though it
was a full mile and an half from the inn - ANON4-1791-2,157.229

It is like all passages under ground - ANON4-1791-2,157.230

They tell you it is possible to go all the <P_158> way to Lille under
ground by this passage, ANON4-1791-2,158.231

<font> Credat Judaeus Apella, non Ego <$$font> - ANON4-1791-2,158.232

It is certainly of very great extent, and perhaps, even in length,
ANON4-1791-2,158.233

you might go four or five miles - ANON4-1791-2,158.234

a man and boy light you, each with a torch - ANON4-1791-2,158.235

The moment you enter, you find yourself astonishingly oppressed with
the cold, and the moment you come out, with the contrary sensation -
ANON4-1791-2,158.236

It seems to be a kind of stone quarry, supported by a great number of
square stone pillars - ANON4-1791-2,158.237

All the stone they use for building in the adjacent country is fetched
from it ANON4-1791-2,158.238

and under one part of it I saw great quantities of hay and corn divided
into small portions - ANON4-1791-2,158.239

this is private property, deposited there by the peasants, to defend it
from the inclemency of the weather; ANON4-1791-2,158.240

and such is the force of honesty in this country, amongst even these poor
illiterate peasants, that I am told every man's property is as safe here
as <P_159> under lock and key.  ANON4-1791-2,159.241

- In time of war, this passage serves as a secure asylum for the
inhabitants to hide their goods in on the approach of an enemy -
ANON4-1791-2,159.242

Your conductor shews you a part of the passage, where some years
since a young lad fell down, I suppose not less than sixty feet;
ANON4-1791-2,159.243

he laid there between two or three days, ANON4-1791-2,159.244

was then found and taken alive, ANON4-1791-2,159.245

and is now living at Maestricht - ANON4-1791-2,159.246

I took a man from the inn to shew me all the curiosities of the place -
not that there was any occasion for it; ANON4-1791-2,159.247

but the poor fellow came ANON4-1791-2,159.248

and offered his services so genteelly, ANON4-1791-2,159.249

and resembled so much Shakespear's apothecary in Romeo and Juliet, that
I could not resist the inclination I felt to present him with a <font>
petit ecu {COM:sic_no_accent} <$$font>, ANON4-1791-2,159.250

and I dare say his pride would not have permitted him to accept it as
a douceur - ANON4-1791-2,159.251

The man who lights you through the subterraneous passage expects $half
$a $crown {TEXT:half-a-crown} - ANON4-1791-2,159.252

The public amusements <P_160> at Maestricht are very good,
ANON4-1791-2,160.253

and I dare say the town is very lively in the winter, as many Dutch
families of consequence reside in it.  ANON4-1791-2,160.254

The <font> Come`die <$$font> is a very good one, performed by a French
company, who are esteemed very capital - ANON4-1791-2,160.255

I took up my abode at the <font> Moulin a` Vent - <$$font>
ANON4-1791-2,160.256

It is by much the best inn here, ANON4-1791-2,160.257

but there are none good; ANON4-1791-2,160.258

this inn is famous for good Champagne, ANON4-1791-2,160.259

I never drank so good in my life - ANON4-1791-2,160.260

it was however dear, eight skelins a bottle, which is four Shillings
English - ANON4-1791-2,160.261

All the way I have travelled from Brussels to this place the wines have
been getting better, and dearer; Burgundy six skelins a bottle, and <font>
Vin du Rhin <$$font> the same price - ANON4-1791-2,160.262

From Maestricht to Bois le Due, you may go by water, ANON4-1791-2,160.263

but it is a wretched tedious conveyance - ANON4-1791-2,160.264

I therefore preferred land carriage, ANON4-1791-2,160.265

and hired at the Post-house a coach and four horses, which I engaged
to carry me thither in two days, for which <P_161> I paid three Louis,
a crown, one skelin, and ten liards, which is the regulated price -
ANON4-1791-2,161.266

The Post-Master has <paren> to make use of the words of an able and
witty Senator, who, in a certain respectable assembly, often entertains
his hearers by the sprightliness of his fancy and brilliancy of his
wit <$$paren> a great deal of the <font> insolence of office, <$$font>
ANON4-1791-2,161.267

and thinks it derogatory to his dignity to use one word more than is
absolutely necessary - ANON4-1791-2,161.268

he is indeed a complete Flemish boor - ANON4-1791-2,161.269

As you enter, and as you go out of Maestricht, you are stopped at the
gates to write your name, the next place you design to go to, with the
inn at which you mean to lodge; ANON4-1791-2,161.270

but here, contrary to the former places, you find civility, and I may
add politeness, without one interested view - ANON4-1791-2,161.271

you receive a low bow, ANON4-1791-2,161.272

and they do not expect <paren> and probably, if you offered, would not
accept <$$paren> any douceur - ANON4-1791-2,161.273

The moment you leave <P_162> Maestricht, you get into an open,
disagreeable, flat country - ANON4-1791-2,162.274

The road is, for the greatest part of the way, over a barren, sandy
heath, through cross roads, which, in winter, must be often impassable -
ANON4-1791-2,162.275

The country is very thinly populated, ANON4-1791-2,162.276

and you meet with but few villages - ANON4-1791-2,162.277

The only ones are Stockem, Bree, Weert, <paren> commonly called Falcon
Weert, from being famous for the breed of those birds, and from which
place Lord Orford in general procures them <$$paren> which you pass
through the first day - ANON4-1791-2,162.278

You go forty-eight miles before night, ANON4-1791-2,162.279

and have a very long day's journey, almost as much as eighty miles in
England - ANON4-1791-2,162.280

I would advise all who travel this road, to get out very early from
Maestricht - ANON4-1791-2,162.281

I sat out myself before seven o'clock, ANON4-1791-2,162.282

and did not get to the end of my day's journey till past eight at night
- ANON4-1791-2,162.283

Had it been later in the year, I should have got off much earlier,
as it would <P_163> have been very disagreeable, as well as unsafe to
travel such roads in the dark - ANON4-1791-2,163.284

From Maestricht to within a league of Weert, you continue in the dominions
of the Bishop of Liege; ANON4-1791-2,163.285

afterwards you get into the Dutch territories - ANON4-1791-2,163.286

The people you see on the road look miserably poor, ANON4-1791-2,163.287

and send all their children out to beg of you, as you pass -
ANON4-1791-2,163.288

You dine at Bre`e, which is a little bourck rather prettily situated -
ANON4-1791-2,163.289

I must recommend to all travellers, when they enter their <font> Auberge
<$$font> <paren> in case it is on a Friday, or any day in Lent <$$paren>
to remember, that the first thing they say to their host is, that they
are Protestants; ANON4-1791-2,163.290

otherwise, though they have had nothing to eat since six o'clock in the
morning, some weak soup, a few potatoes and oil, with a stinking pickled
herring, will be all their dinner - ANON4-1791-2,163.291

I do not know what there was in my face, which induced them to suffer
me to come within the pale of their church - ANON4-1791-2,163.292

I <P_164> am sure, I never felt myself less inclined to embrace their
tenets, than after the bad dinner I had - ANON4-1791-2,164.293

Very fortunately I found a piece of cheese in the house, which was the
very best I had eaten, since I left England - ANON4-1791-2,164.294

The Dutch think they have this article of provisions in the very highest
perfection - ANON4-1791-2,164.295

I am not inclined to own it; ANON4-1791-2,164.296

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} think it can be compared with either the North
Wiltshire, or Cheshire cheese of our country - ANON4-1791-2,164.297

At the different places you stop at, you find none but the landlord and
landlady who speak French - ANON4-1791-2,164.298

The common people either speak a confused jargon of their own, or Low
Dutch - ANON4-1791-2,164.299

You sleep at <heading> <font> Eyndhover, <$$font> <$$heading> Which
is a very inconsiderable little town, though sufficiently important
to be under <P_165> the government of a Burgomaster and Schepens -
ANON4-1791-2,165.300

There are two or three neat churches here; yet nothing to be seen in
the inside of them - ANON4-1791-2,165.301

Travellers would do well to get rid of their German money here, as the
coin which goes current in Holland, is entirely different from the German;
ANON4-1791-2,165.302

the chief pieces of money are, The reyder, which is fourteen gilders.
The ducat, five gilders, five sols.  The gilder, 20 sols.  The styver
one sol; ANON4-1791-2,165.303

besides these, there are double reyders, half reyders, five styvers and
an half, &c. in common use - ANON4-1791-2,165.304

French crowns and half-crowns are also very current in every part of
Holland - ANON4-1791-2,165.305

Eyndhover is only six leagues from Bois le Duc - ANON4-1791-2,165.306

When you get half way, you meet again the pave`, which forsook you when
you left <P_166> Maestricht - ANON4-1791-2,166.307

When you come to a little village named Boxtel, the country grows
delightfully pleasant, ANON4-1791-2,166.308

and you see several gentlemens'elegant houses.  ANON4-1791-2,166.309

It is not a little remarkable, that all the way from Maestricht to Bois
le Duc, you neither ascend, or descend one hill, scarce is there any
elevation of the ground the whole way - ANON4-1791-2,166.310

This is a circumstance I dare say, not to be met with in going the same
number of miles in any other part of Europe, and which, in my opinion,
makes very great amends for the barrenness of the country, and sameness
of prospect - ANON4-1791-2,166.311

You are carried at Eyndhover to the Post-house, ANON4-1791-2,166.312

the sign is, I think, the Star; ANON4-1791-2,166.313

and, considering it is so trifling a thoroughfare, the accommodations
are by no means bad - ANON4-1791-2,166.314

When you reach <P_167> <heading> Bois le Duc, <$$heading> You are stopped,
as usual, for your name, &c. ANON4-1791-2,167.315

The entrance to this place is over two or three draw-bridges -
ANON4-1791-2,167.316

the ramparts and fortifications appear very strong - ANON4-1791-2,167.317

This place, during the troubles of the war between Spain and Holland,
suffered less than most towns; ANON4-1791-2,167.318

it was only besieged once by Prince Maurice, ANON4-1791-2,167.319

but the Archduke Albert coming to its relief, he was obliged to raise
the siege - ANON4-1791-2,167.320

in 1629, however, the Dutch succeeded better, ANON4-1791-2,167.321

and took it with very little resistance on the part of the inhabitants,
ANON4-1791-2,167.322

and ever since it has been subject to them - ANON4-1791-2,167.323

There is one regiment almost always in the town, and on account of the
jealousy subsisting between the French and Dutch, <paren> though the
former are dignified by the latter with the <P_168> appellation of their
<font> Great and Good Allies <$$font> <$$paren> ANON4-1791-2,168.324

The new raised regiment of Count Maillebois was sent there by the States
a few months after I left the place - ANON4-1791-2,168.325

At Bois le Duc I know no curiosities worthy your attention;
ANON4-1791-2,168.326

it is an ill-built, poor-looking town, ANON4-1791-2,168.327

and being no thoroughfare, must be in general very dull -
ANON4-1791-2,168.328

I went down to look at the Bason for the Shipping, which is indeed no
despicable one, though the vessels are but small; ANON4-1791-2,168.329

they carry, however, merchandize of different kinds to all the ports of
Holland - ANON4-1791-2,168.330

There is a vessel constantly sails three times a week to Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, and the Hague - ANON4-1791-2,168.331

However partial I may be to water carriage; yet it is only when that
conveyance is certain, and the time of being on board limited, which is
always the case when you go by the canals, ANON4-1791-2,168.332

yet I like not to trust myself to the uncertainty, <paren> which to me
is worse than the inclemency <$$paren> with respect <P_169> to time of
the winds and waves; ANON4-1791-2,169.333

and therefore I the rather chose to go in the most wretched land carriage
, which human ingenuity <paren> or more properly human stupidity <$$paren>
could devise - ANON4-1791-2,169.334

They call the machine a post-waggon, ANON4-1791-2,169.335

and if jolting and shaking are esteemed peculiar good qualities in a
waggon, I know not any thing which has greater pretensions to the title
- ANON4-1791-2,169.336

Had the weather been at the freezing point, I am well convinced no one
who travelled in such equipage would feel the smallest inconvenience
from cold - ANON4-1791-2,169.337

they resemble very much the Newmarket rabbit caravans,
ANON4-1791-2,169.338

and when I have said this, I pay the post-waggons of Bois le Duc a very
high compliment - ANON4-1791-2,169.339

I did not mean in this description to include all the post-waggons of
Holland, ANON4-1791-2,169.340

for I have really seen some built with very great taste, and hung on a
light and easy principle - ANON4-1791-2,169.341

I must in justice however to the carriages of <P_170> Bois le Duc,
acknowledge the cause of my bad conveyance, which was the grand fait of
the town, this being an amusement more followed after than any other in
Holland; ANON4-1791-2,170.342

the young Damons had hired all the better sort of carriages for their
Phillis's - ANON4-1791-2,170.343

Bad as was my conveyance, I was glad to put up with it, and contented
to pay seventeen gilders for it - ANON4-1791-2,170.344

I have entirely forgot the sign of the inn I stopt at,
ANON4-1791-2,170.345

it seemed not a very good one; ANON4-1791-2,170.346

yet, as we only stayed to breakfast, it did not much signify what sort
of an inn it was - ANON4-1791-2,170.347

The road from Bois le Duc to Utrecht is all through a cross country
, and sometimes <paren> even in the summer <$$paren> impassable -
ANON4-1791-2,170.348

You must think you have a good coachman, and remarkable good horses,
if you go as fast as three miles an hour - ANON4-1791-2,170.349

you cross the Maese and Rhine several times; ANON4-1791-2,170.350

each passenger pays two sols, ANON4-1791-2,170.351

the carriage and horses are paid for by the coachman -
ANON4-1791-2,170.352

<P_171>

You are ferryed by means of ropes fixed to stakes on each side of the
river, which run by means of pullies - ANON4-1791-2,171.354

The only place you meet with in your way is <heading> Bommel, <$$heading>
Which is about nine miles from Bois le Duc - ANON4-1791-2,171.355

It is the capital of the island of that name, situated on the Maese,
ANON4-1791-2,171.356

and is in the confines of Brabant - ANON4-1791-2,171.357

This place was besieged towards the close of the sixteenth century by
the Spaniards - ANON4-1791-2,171.358

The Dutch, however, contrived to throw succours into it,
ANON4-1791-2,171.359

and the army of the States coming to its relief, obliged the Spaniards
to relinquish their undertaking - ANON4-1791-2,171.360

Bommel has, on account of its important situation, been always well
garrisoned, and the fortifications kept up at no small expence to the
States - ANON4-1791-2,171.361

<P_172>

it had five hundred regular troops in it, under the command of the
Prince of Hesse D'Armstadt {COM:sic}, who is Governor of the Island -
ANON4-1791-2,172.363

It is as neat a town as ever I saw, and not unpleasantly situated -
ANON4-1791-2,172.364

It is the residence of several merchants and Dutch gentlemen of middling
fortunes, who retire here to enjoy the <font> otium cum dignitate <$$font>
at a moderate expence - ANON4-1791-2,172.365

You pay four sols each passenger for liberty to pass through this town -
a kind of turnpike on the human race, which is demanded of you as you
go out of the gates - ANON4-1791-2,172.366

We were detained so long here, from the owner of the ferry-boat not being
to be met with, that we found it impossible to reach Utrecht that night
- ANON4-1791-2,172.367

After going therefore not more than a couple of leagues from Bommel,
we took up our residence for that night at a small village, called
Geldermalsen - ANON4-1791-2,172.368

a most miserable night's lodging it was; ANON4-1791-2,172.369

few hedge ale-house in England have <P_173> such very bad accommodations
, ANON4-1791-2,173.370

and what added to the unpleasantness, neither host, hostess, coachman
, or any person in the house spoke any other language but Low Dutch,
which was next to speaking no language at all - ANON4-1791-2,173.371

I would recommend to all, who purpose travelling this road, to stay all
night at Bois le Duc, and set out from thence by four o'clock in the
morning - ANON4-1791-2,173.372

By this means they will avoid every inconvenience, and reach Utrecht
the same night - ANON4-1791-2,173.373

From Geldermalsen, after you have gone two or three miles, the road
mends much, ANON4-1791-2,173.374

- yet all the way from Bois le Duc, the country is miserably poor -
ANON4-1791-2,173.375

On each side the traveller beholds large swampy meadows, almost constantly
covered with water - ANON4-1791-2,173.376

his journey is on a sandy, heavy road, rendered doubly fatiguing by the
immense quantity of rain that fell last autumn - ANON4-1791-2,173.377

The country is very thinly populated, ANON4-1791-2,173.378

and the <P_174> people you do see have all the marks of extreme poverty
and wretchedness - ANON4-1791-2,174.379

This, to an Englishman accustomed to see in his own country rich,
cultivated corn fields, with dry, beautiful pastures, is wretched beyond
description.  ANON4-1791-2,174.380

<heading>

Utrecht <$$heading> Is rather prettily situated, ANON4-1791-2,174.382

and the entrance to it looks chearful - ANON4-1791-2,174.383

the face of the country mends in every respect the nearer you get to
this city - ANON4-1791-2,174.384

This is the capital of the province of the same name, ANON4-1791-2,174.385

and stands pleasantly situated on the Northern branch of the Rhine -
ANON4-1791-2,174.386

it is the see of a Bishop, ANON4-1791-2,174.387

and has a most capital university in it; by some preferred to that of
Leyden - ANON4-1791-2,174.388

Utrecht was the first province which resisted the collection of the
tax on the subjects of his <P_175> master in the Netherlands in 1672,
which gave rise to the revolt of the Low Countries - ANON4-1791-2,175.389

The resolute conduct pursued by the rulers in this city and province,
in opposing the levy of the tenth penny, may with great justice be said
to be the original cause of the independency of the United Provinces;
ANON4-1791-2,175.390

for as the other States had only agreed to the levy of this tax, on
condition that all the provinces agreed to it, so this resistance
, on the part of Utrecht, annulled immediately the obligation -
ANON4-1791-2,175.391

To the famous treaty of alliance, which was concluded between the
provinces of Flanders, Friezland, Holland, Guelderland, Zealand, and
Brabant, some years after the revolt, do the Dutch owe the foundation
of their now flourishing and powerful republic; ANON4-1791-2,175.392

and this treaty of union has ever been considered by them, as
containing the fundamental principles of their present constitution -
ANON4-1791-2,175.393

In latter times <P_176> Utrecht has supported its consequence by the
famous treaty concluded here in 1713.  ANON4-1791-2,176.394

The inhabitants of this province have been always famous for the
turbulence and restlessness of their dispositions, and for a rooted
aversion to the Stadtholder - ANON4-1791-2,176.395

Faction has been, for several months past, higher here than in any
of the provinces - The Prince of Orange <paren> for what cause I know
not <$$paren> held in the greatest detestation and contempt at Utrecht,
and every thing done to thwart his measures, without considering whether
they tend to promote the public good, or not - ANON4-1791-2,176.396

and their inveteracy is not confined to the Prince alone,
ANON4-1791-2,176.397

but extends even to his partizans - ANON4-1791-2,176.398

A clergyman, a little previous to my going to Utrecht, having the
imprudence to mix politicks and religion together in his sermon, and to
enforce from the pulpit a proper submission and respect to the Stadholder
, was driven <P_177> from his church, ANON4-1791-2,177.399

and had nearly paid his life as a forfeiture to his rashness and folly -
ANON4-1791-2,177.400

And, as in so large a city, it is impossible an union of sentiment can
exist amongst the different ranks of men in political affairs, so the
weaker part have been obliged <paren> as is in general the case <$$paren>
to yield to the stronger; ANON4-1791-2,177.401

and though disapproving the violent measures of their opponents are,
under the necessity of suffering their discontents to remain hidden,
ready to burst forth on some future occasion, when it may be their turn
to boast a superiority in point of numbers, and consequently in power.
ANON4-1791-2,177.402

A merchant of Utrecht, not more than a fortnight before my arrival, having
delivered his sentiments in favour of the Stadtholder, with rather too
much warmth, and too little reserve, was marked out immediately by the
opposite party as an object of revenge - ANON4-1791-2,177.403

They combined together to ruin him, ANON4-1791-2,177.404

and <P_178> by underselling him in his trade, &c. &c. so
far succeeded as to drive him from the city - ANON4-1791-2,178.405

It seems to me at present, that the resolute tone in which several
of the powers of Europe, especially the late King of Prussia, have
spoke {COM:sic} their sentiment to their High Mightinesses against the
impropriety and $disrespectfulness {TEXT:disrepectfulness} of their
conduct to the Prince of Orange, has had in some measure the desired
effect, ANON4-1791-2,178.406

and will at last induce them to permit him the exercise of those rights
, and of that proper authority and power, always attached to the
office of Stadtholder, and which the moderation and prudence of the
present Stadtholder's conduct has certainly never justly forfeited -
ANON4-1791-2,178.407

Utrecht is a very large populous city, ANON4-1791-2,178.408

and has some very fine churches in it, though <paren> after coming
out of a Roman Catholick country <$$paren> they appear at a very great
disadvantage - ANON4-1791-2,178.409

Very few good paintings are ever <P_179> to be seen within the churches
of Protestants - ANON4-1791-2,179.410

The church of St. Martin, at Utrecht, is an elegant building,
ANON4-1791-2,179.411

the tower of it is three hundred and sixty feet high -
ANON4-1791-2,179.412

from the top you may very plainly see Amsterdam, and they tell you
fourteen more considerable cities or towns - ANON4-1791-2,179.413

The day was, however, considerably too cloudy to see them when I was
there - ANON4-1791-2,179.414

The streets are built very regular, ANON4-1791-2,179.415

and some very handsome private edifices stand in them -
ANON4-1791-2,179.416

The Mall is a very charming walk, and of a Sunday, or an holiday, crowded
immensely with the Bourgeois and their wives - ANON4-1791-2,179.417

There is a very noble prison here, a rasp-house, and spin-house, the
same as at Amsterdam - ANON4-1791-2,179.418

It is observed, that there are fewer executions in Utrecht than in any
other province of Holland, ANON4-1791-2,179.419

and it is a great number of years since an execution has been here;
ANON4-1791-2,179.420

there are also fewer debtors, and convicts of every <P_180> kind;
ANON4-1791-2,180.421

I know not to what cause this can be attributed - ANON4-1791-2,180.422

The inhabitants of the Province boast much of this circumstance -
ANON4-1791-2,180.423

I think however, they are more indebted to good fortune, than to any
other cause - ANON4-1791-2,180.424

From Utrecht to Amsterdam, you may go all the way by water,
ANON4-1791-2,180.425

and it is so delightful a ride by the canal, that most travellers,
I am convinced, would prefer that mode of conveyance to any other -
ANON4-1791-2,180.426

indeed very few people in Holland travel any other way than by water -
ANON4-1791-2,180.427

There is a track-scoot sails every day, or more properly several times
in a day - ANON4-1791-2,180.428

I would advise those who go by it, and who wish to be at all comfortable ,
to take the small cabin to themselves, ANON4-1791-2,180.429

otherwise they will be crammed into a place, where should it be as
bad weather as when I was conveyed by it, they will be almost stifled;
the only inlets for air being in that case closed - ANON4-1791-2,180.430

The cabin you are put in, if you go <P_181> as a common passenger , a
tall man can scarce sit upright in, much less stand - ANON4-1791-2,181.431

thirty or forty people are stowed together in it as close as possible,
and those of every description and size - ANON4-1791-2,181.432

Merchants, Jews, sailors, women, and children, promiscuously crowd this
wretched stowage - ANON4-1791-2,181.433

the men, for the most part, smoke all the way - ANON4-1791-2,181.434

This mode of travelling $can $not {TEXT:cannot} therefore be very pleasant
to an Englishman - ANON4-1791-2,181.435

The small cabin, at the stern of the barge, only holds four people,
ANON4-1791-2,181.436

it is therefore necessary to bespeak it over night, ANON4-1791-2,181.437

else you will hardly be able to procure it - ANON4-1791-2,181.438

You pay forty-two sols for it, which is at the rate of six sols an hour
- ANON4-1791-2,181.439

For a place in the common cabin you pay only two sols an hour
ANON4-1791-2,181.440

<paren> they reckon here by hours, not miles <$$paren> -
ANON4-1791-2,181.441

They travel here much faster than in Flanders, ANON4-1791-2,181.442

and are scarce seven hours going from Utrecht to Amsterdam -
ANON4-1791-2,181.443

All the way you see on each <P_182> side of you large handsome houses,
with most delightful gardens, which come quite down to the water's
edge, and are laid out with a great deal of taste and elegance -
ANON4-1791-2,182.444

These belong most of them to the rich Bourgeois of Amsterdam and Utrecht
, who retire here <paren> as our English cits do to the villages in
the environs of the metropolis <$$paren> from the hurry and bustle of
business, to enjoy a Saturday and Sunday's rest, free from care and
interruption - ANON4-1791-2,182.445

In this little ride you have a specimen <paren> and no unsuccessful one
<$$paren> of the efforts of art to supplant nature - ANON4-1791-2,182.446

In a country unusually swampy and marshy, in the midst of meadows covered
with water, and scarcely a corn field to be seen, yet on the banks of
the river, in this wretched situation by description, and still more
wretched in reality, you see gardens laid out in a stile of elegance,
which would do no discredit to the most fertile spot in the globe <P_183>
- ANON4-1791-2,183.447

The water is all drained off by sluices from the houses,
ANON4-1791-2,183.448

and I am informed they are all perfectly dry - ANON4-1791-2,183.449

The moment you reach the place of landing at Amsterdam, swarms of porters
, most of them Jews, meet you with out-stretched arms, ready to grasp
your baggage - ANON4-1791-2,183.450

They are all, for the most part, a set of iniquitous villains -
ANON4-1791-2,183.451

The best thing a stranger can do, is to fix his eye upon one who is not
a Jew, or <paren> if he is a sufficient good physiognomist <$$paren>
one who has the least spark of honesty written on his countenance -
ANON4-1791-2,183.452

this man will fetch you a wheelbarrow, ANON4-1791-2,183.453

and, in the mean time, I would advise, that yourself or servants watch
narrowly your baggage, to take care these light fingered gentlemen do
not ease you of part of it - ANON4-1791-2,183.454

When all your things are put into the wheelbarrow, make your porter
drive them before you to the hotel you mean to reside <P_184> at -
ANON4-1791-2,184.455

Give him for his trouble one, two, or three gilders, according to the
distance; ANON4-1791-2,184.456

the landlord will, however, tell you his proper fare -
ANON4-1791-2,184.457

I went to the White Hart, in Warmoes-street, which is in a very good part
of the town, and is a good hotel, kept by one Lewis, who was formerly
in our navy, ANON4-1791-2,184.458

he accommodates you well and reasonably.  ANON4-1791-2,184.459

On entering <heading> Amsterdam <$$heading> You are immediately stricken
with the extreme neatness and grandeur of the city - ANON4-1791-2,184.460

Trade here wears a most flourishing, chearful aspect, ANON4-1791-2,184.461

nor do you see one idle fellow in the streets - ANON4-1791-2,184.462

This city is situated on the river Amstel, ANON4-1791-2,184.463

and is esteemed the greatest port in the world, ANON4-1791-2,184.464

yet the entrance to it is so very dangerous, and attended with such
<P_185> disadvantages, that it is very inconvenient, as well as hazardous,
for loaded ships, and men of war, to enter it - ANON4-1791-2,185.465

The foundations of this city are laid on large piles of wood, driven
into the morass, the Stadthouse alone having near 14,000 to support it -
ANON4-1791-2,185.466

This city, in the fourteenth century, was only a little insignificant
fishing town; ANON4-1791-2,185.467

since that time it has risen to the state in which it is at present -
a state of magnificence, grandeur, and riches, not to be surpassed,
and scarcely to be equalled by any city in Europe - ANON4-1791-2,185.468

It has in several instances evinced the resources it possesses within
itself, independent of the other provinces - ANON4-1791-2,185.469

It was amongst the last cities which acceded to the confederacy of the
States, ANON4-1791-2,185.470

nor did it shake off its allegiance to Spain till the year 1578, six years
after the first breaking out of the disturbances in the Low Countries -
ANON4-1791-2,185.471

Surrounded at this time by enemies <P_186> on all sides, deprived of
its inland trade by the States, who forbad {COM:sic} any communication
with them, while under the Spanish yoke, it was obliged <paren> though
with reluctance <$$paren> to accede to the confederacy, and submit to
the government of the States - ANON4-1791-2,186.472

In the year 1672, Louis XIVth invaded the United Provinces,
ANON4-1791-2,186.473

and such brilliant success at first attended his arms, that, in the
course of a few weeks, he gained possession of the provinces of Gueldres
, Utrecht, and Overryssel, and had he not wasted his time at Utrecht in
vain pomp and useless parade, all the United Provinces would undoubtedly
have fallen under the dominion of France - ANON4-1791-2,186.474

At this period Amsterdam alone retained the smallest degree of courage
or resolution - ANON4-1791-2,186.475

The rapid success which had attended the arms of the French Monarch
had stuck such a panic into the other provinces, as deprived them
of all ability to make any <P_187> exertions for the common good -
ANON4-1791-2,187.476

The conduct of Amsterdam raised them from the stupor into which they
were fallen - ANON4-1791-2,187.477

That city alone made those exertions which astonished all Europe -
ANON4-1791-2,187.478

The Magistrates appointed an extraordinary guard of the Bourgeois -
ANON4-1791-2,187.479

the populace were kept under subjection by the influence of money -
ANON4-1791-2,187.480

ships were stationed to guard the coast, and prevent supplies from coming
to the French army - ANON4-1791-2,187.481

the greatest part of the adjacent country was also laid under water -
ANON4-1791-2,187.482

These precautions <paren> intelligence of which was constantly transmitted
to the French Monarch <$$paren> induced him to give up the attempt of
any further conquest that campaign, ANON4-1791-2,187.483

and he returned, crowned with laurels, to Paris, amidst the
congratulations and rejoicings of his subjects, who, in viewing the glory
he had acquired from his rapid successes, forgot the price at which they
had been purchased, <P_188> as well as the little advantage they were
likely to derive from it - ANON4-1791-2,188.484

Not more than three months after his return, the Provinces were recovered
by the States, ANON4-1791-2,188.485

and their old masters resumed the government.  ANON4-1791-2,188.486

- I shall now proceed to give you an account of the public buildings,
curiosities, &c. in this place; ANON4-1791-2,188.487

and as the government of the different cities in Holland vary {COM:sic}
very little, I shall detain you just long enough to give you some idea
of the internal policy of Amsterdam - ANON4-1791-2,188.488

I shall begin with the public buildings &c. ANON4-1791-2,188.489

and shall premise my account by informing you, that after you have
been in the Netherlands, and seen the churches of the Roman Catholicks,
you will find none here which claim your attention.  ANON4-1791-2,188.490

The Town-house is the first building I shall recommend to your notice -
ANON4-1791-2,188.491

It was <P_189> erected in the year 1648, ANON4-1791-2,189.492

and does very great honour to the different artists, who have been
employed in the design and execution of the building, both within and
without - ANON4-1791-2,189.493

In the architecture of this edifice, you find three orders, the Ionick ,
Roman, and Corinthian, all so happily blended together, as to shew the
distinct beauties of each - ANON4-1791-2,189.494

The different apartments, halls, &c. are extremely well
proportioned, ANON4-1791-2,189.495

and through the <font> tout ensemble <$$font> reigns an elegance
and just proportion, which strikes the beholder at first sight -
ANON4-1791-2,189.496

The hall is about one hundred and sixteen feet high, more than two
hundred and eighty long, and between two hundred and fifty and two
hundred and sixty in breadth, so that it is in fact almost square -
ANON4-1791-2,189.497

To take up your time with giving you an exact representation of the rooms,
statues, busts, paintings, &c. would only be putting your patience
to a severe trial, ANON4-1791-2,189.498

nor <P_190> could be interesting to any but those who have been on the
spot, and who may buy an antient English translation of the curiosities
, &c. to be seen at the Townhouse, for something less than
sixpence, of an old woman who sits at the bottom of the stairs -
ANON4-1791-2,190.499

I shall, however, venture to mention some, amongst the many things , to
be seen within this building, which particularly attracted my attention,
and will <paren> I doubt not <$$paren> most of those who visit Amsterdam
- ANON4-1791-2,190.500

In the first place I would recommend to your notice in the <font> Salle
de Haute Justice <$$font> <paren> for your attendant speaks French,
and therefore I shall use this language in giving you the names of the
different apartments <$$paren> three pieces of most beautiful white
marble <font> en bas relief <$$font>, between eight and nine feet high,
and at least six broad - ANON4-1791-2,190.501

These contain antient histories as of King Solomon deciding the famous
dispute between the two <P_191> harlots - Seleucus, lawgiver of Locria
, loseing his eye to preserve one of his son, condemned to lose both,
being convicted of adultery - Brutus witnessing the death of his sons,
who suffered as traitors to their country; ANON4-1791-2,191.502

all these are of the most beautiful marble, and strongly expressive of the
different representations they are meant to convey, ANON4-1791-2,191.503

and are the work of that very eminent master, Artus Quellin, of Antwerp
- ANON4-1791-2,191.504

The ceiling in the <font> Salle de Bourgeois <$$font> has been done
after the designs of John Goeree, the painting executed by Hoogzaat,
and the architecture by Gerard Rademaker - ANON4-1791-2,191.505

it deserves your notice very much - though to particularize the several
beauties of it, would be only doing it a very great injustice, as well
as in part anticipating the pleasure you will receive from viewing it -
ANON4-1791-2,191.506

In the chamber <font> des Bourgumaitres <$$font> is a most beautiful
picture, which represents the son of <P_192> Fabius Maximus, who, during
his consulship, obliged his father to alight from his horse when he
approached him - ANON4-1791-2,192.507

this is the work of John Lievenz, ANON4-1791-2,192.508

and is executed wonderfully well - ANON4-1791-2,192.509

You see not far from it a picture of Ferdinand de Bols - the subject of
which is the fortitude and patriotism of Fabricius, sent Ambassador by
the Romans to Pyrrhus, whom neither threats, nor flattering promises,
could entice from his allegiance to this country - ANON4-1791-2,192.510

There is also here a picture of Joesph and his brethren, two or three
beautiful portraits of Mary de Medicis, and some others not very capital
- ANON4-1791-2,192.511

in the chamber <font> Du Conseil <$$font> is an excellent picture
by Flink, of Solomon asking wisdom of the Almighty; and another,
representing Moses chusing some of the elders, as judges in common
affairs - ANON4-1791-2,192.512

this is the work of John Brankhort - ANON4-1791-2,192.513

In the hall of <font> Beaux Arts, <$$font> which is the marine office,
you see a number <P_193> of precious pieces of painting and sculpture ,
some of which belong to the Stadthouse, and some to the different artists
residing in the city, who wish to sell them, and therefore place them
there for the inspection of strangers - ANON4-1791-2,193.514

in the <font> Schepen's {COM:see_errata} Chamber <$$font> are several
very good pictures, amongst which there is one of Moses giving the law
to the Israelites; another representing the children of Israel in the
desart {COM:sic}, who, in the absence of Moses, worship the golden calf;
ANON4-1791-2,193.515

the colours of these are in the highest preservation imaginable,
ANON4-1791-2,193.516

and will, I am sure, particularly please you - ANON4-1791-2,193.517

In the <font> Secre`taire <$$font> you are shewn the picture of Mary de
Medicis, and of Charles Vth, both of which are esteemed very excellent
paintings - ANON4-1791-2,193.518

The cieling {COM:sic} in the Treasury <font> Ordinaire` {COM:sic} <$$font>
particularly merits your attention, ANON4-1791-2,193.519

it is remarkably elegant, ANON4-1791-2,193.520

and boasts the fertile invention of Holstein - ANON4-1791-2,193.521

The statues in the cabinet <font> Des <P_194> Bourgue Maitres <$$font>
are well worthy the notice of all those who are curious in sculpture -
ANON4-1791-2,194.522

The eight which represent Venus, Diana, Cybele, Saturn, Jupiter , Mars,
Mercury, and Apollo, are the finest and most beautiful white marble,
as large as life, the work of the very best masters - ANON4-1791-2,194.523

At the bottom of the gallery, between the pillars, you see several
beautiful pictures, descriptive of the wars between the antient Batavians
and Romans, ANON4-1791-2,194.524

one represents the consultation between Claudius Civilis, and the Chiefs
of the Batavians, to shake off the Roman yoke - ANON4-1791-2,194.525

the piece is executed by Ovens - ANON4-1791-2,194.526

Another describes the peace concluded between the Batavians and Romans,
ANON4-1791-2,194.527

is esteemed amongst the <font> chef d'oeuvres <$$font> of that excellent
artist, Jordaans - ANON4-1791-2,194.528

There are two or three other pictures executed by the same master,
one representing Samson slaying the Philistines with the jaw-bone of
an ass; the other, <P_195> David in the combat with Goliah {COM:sic}
- ANON4-1791-2,195.529

In the several rooms there are different paintings by Vandyke, Rubens ,
Vander Hulst, and other eminent artists, yet not a great number, in my
opinion, which would gratify your curiosity - ANON4-1791-2,195.530

It is worth your while to go up to the top of the Townhouse, from which
you have the most extensive and pleasing view over the whole city and
part of the adjacent country - ANON4-1791-2,195.531

To the woman who shews you the Stadthouse, it is customary to give a
gilder; and two, if the company are numerous - ANON4-1791-2,195.532

On the ground-floor of the Stadthouse is the prison for malefactors,
which, on account of the neatness of the wards, and the regularity
and good order that are preserved, is well worth your attention -
ANON4-1791-2,195.533

There was but one criminal under confinement when I was there -
ANON4-1791-2,195.534

you are shewn the horrid instruments of torture, and which, I much fear,
are often used to <P_196> extort proof, when it is not other wise to be
obtained - ANON4-1791-2,196.535

On the sight of these instruments, an Englishman reflects with heart-felt
satisfaction on the inestimable blessing <paren> which amidst all the
disadvantages and burthen of taxes <$$paren> he enjoys in the so truly
boasted liberty of his own country, where he knows his life, property ,
and every thing valuable to him, are protected by laws, agreed to by the
majority of his fellow countrymen, to which even the highest stations
are amenable.  ANON4-1791-2,196.536

- Tried by his own peers, he feels conscious of being acquitted, if
innocent; and punished, if guilty - ANON4-1791-2,196.537

he fears no torture, no violence, to produce a confession of imaginary
guilt, when none real exists - ANON4-1791-2,196.538

I regard it as one of the most extraordinary circumstances in the
civil government of the United Provinces, that a criminal $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be capitally convicted by the concurrent testimony of a
thousand witnesses, <P_197> except he himself confesses the crime laid
to his charge, which, if he will not voluntarily do, he is immediately
put to the rack, where it is very seldom <paren> however innocent he
may be <$$paren> that he possesses fortitude sufficient to withstand
the excruciating pain of this severe punishment for a supposed offence -
ANON4-1791-2,197.539

If he confesses his crime, the deposition is taken down,
ANON4-1791-2,197.540

and he is released from the torture - ANON4-1791-2,197.541

Two surgeons and physicians stand by the whole time <paren> as
your conductor informs you <$$paren> to see justice done him -
ANON4-1791-2,197.542

When his life is in danger, they order him to be taken off -
ANON4-1791-2,197.543

To shew, however, the futility of the torture, there has been an instance
lately here, of a malefactor, who resisted all the excruciating pains
of the rack, and of every other torture, which the invention of the most
cruel genius could devise - ANON4-1791-2,197.544

Though undoubtedly guilty of the crime laid to his charge, as the proof
<P_198> against him amounted to a certainty, yet they could not make
him confess his guilt - ANON4-1791-2,198.545

Justice, however, forgot herself here, ANON4-1791-2,198.546

and the civil power took a stride, which, in the most tyrannical
government, it would scarcely have dared to do; ANON4-1791-2,198.547

though, according to the fundamental maxims, <paren> as I have before
related <$$paren> punishment can only follow confession; yet this
poor wretch was executed, under pretence that he was insolent to the
magistrates, which certainly was an offence, which could not in justice
be punished more than by confinement, or by a slight chastisement -
ANON4-1791-2,198.548

Who is there amongst the warmest advocates for despotism and tyranny,
that can reconcile this breach of justice with any system of policy?
