15 <font> th <$$font>, <font> Tuesday <$$font>.  HOBSON-173X-2,288.43

- Spent the morning in meditating on the ill posture of my affairs.
HOBSON-173X-2,288.44

My father had been been lame for several years; my mother old and infirm ,
wore out with age and care.  HOBSON-173X-2,288.45

Severall careless servants, not fit to look after business;
HOBSON-173X-2,288.46

I so weak and so much out of order that I could not tell when I should
be capable myself; HOBSON-173X-2,288.47

payments comming upon me, which in that condition I knew not how to
provide against; HOBSON-173X-2,288.48

besides, I had received a letter from London which gave me an account how
the parliament was going to lay such a duty upon Geneva and all compound
liquors as would certainly ruin the distilling trade, HOBSON-173X-2,288.49

so I supposed my brothers would be incapable of assisting me upon any
emergency; all which thoughts depressed my spirits so much, and made me
so weak, that at nine a clock, when I got up, I supposed myself dying
for severall hours.  HOBSON-173X-2,288.50

I thank God I had no fearfull thoughts, nor was not at all discouraged
at the apprehensions of death.  which I thought every minute approaching
; HOBSON-173X-2,288.51

but took what care I could to spend that <P_289> small portion of time I
thought I had left to my best spirituall advantage.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.52

I sent for Mr. Clarkson, who came about noon, and administred
me the Sacrament, together with my father and mother, and $prayed
{TEXT:praed} with me severall times; HOBSON-173X-2,289.53

thanks be to Almighty God for my recovery, HOBSON-173X-2,289.54

and I hope the impression which this day's sudden illness made upon me
will never $go out of my mind; HOBSON-173X-2,289.55

and when I think how suddenly death may overtake one, it will make me
lead a more circumspect life for the future, and allways have regard to
my latter end.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.56

Towards night Mr. Gregg came, HOBSON-173X-2,289.57

and I was something better; HOBSON-173X-2,289.58

he applied large blistering plasters to the wrists of my arms and to
my back, which tormented me very much, and occasioned me to have the
stranguary all the night.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.59

He said it was a nervous feaver.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.60

At night came Dr. Smithson, who, upon talking with me privately
, found quickly that it was a mentall as well as corporeall distemper,
HOBSON-173X-2,289.61

and told me that I had the hypochondriock passion upon me, which then
I could not believe, as being a meer stranger to that distemper, but
found his words very true, HOBSON-173X-2,289.62

for I was afterwards very often so much disordered in my thoughts that
I could not rest nor govern them.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.63

In a few days I had every day a shaking fit for an hour, afterwards a
fainting fit for 5 hours successively, which gave me the most pain that
can be immagined while it lasted.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.64

Some time after came Dr. Bolderstone, of Coumbridge
HOBSON-173X-2,289.65

<paren> he married the daughter of Mr. Hobson, of Leeds, an
apothecary who was born in this town, and I suppose was some relation of
David and Susan Hobson's who lived and $owned a litle house at the bottom
of Dodworth green, now the property of John Wood of Oxpring walk miln,
and Josua Smith of this town <$$paren>; HOBSON-173X-2,289.66

he said it was an intermitting feaver, HOBSON-173X-2,289.67

but Dr. Smithison said it was rather St. Vitus'dance, and
that I was in no danger of dying, but rather of a palsie of an apoplexy;
HOBSON-173X-2,289.68

so I continued to the end of this month.  HOBSON-173X-2,289.69

Also, Mr. Bamforth, of...  {COM:sic_ellipsis_in_text} nigh Wadsly;
he married a relation of Mr. Marriot's, of Ughill ; which Marriot
was tutor for her, and had a mind to marry her, HOBSON-173X-2,295.248

but his wife was then living, HOBSON-173X-2,295.249

so he contrived to fright her to death, by hiring men to beset his house
, and pretending to robb it, which they did allmost every night for
half a year together, which so terrified the old woman that she died.

Talked with a miner call'd Peter <P_296>.....  <paren> an acquaintance
of James Siddal's <$$paren> who tells {TEXT:telis} me that some time
ago , as a workman was sinking a grave in Haslebadge hills, he met with
a hard substance allmost a yard square, which, when broken, happened to
be a scalp, and in it severall large teeth, which were made into candle
sticks, and are now in Bradall.  HOBSON-173X-2,296.256

He further told me that, as they are digging for lead, they often meet
with large hollow caves, the roof, and sides, and bottom full of congealed
stone like ice; HOBSON-173X-2,296.257

and in one there was a spring of water which fell from the roof, and had
made a hollow place at the bottom, in which were 12 stones of the shape
and bigness of a moor hen's <font> egg, <$$font> and speckeled like them,
which he supposes were formed by the motion of the water turning them
round in the hollow where they lay.  HOBSON-173X-2,296.258

Christopher Greaves <paren> a blacksmith <$$paren> tells me that in
the bank sides of the river betwixt Hope and Hathersedge, as he has
been fishing, he has oft observed small round stones, about the bignes
of marbles which children play withall, to leap out of themselves from
among the shales where they were lodg'd, and tumble down the bank side.
HOBSON-173X-2,296.259

He also {TEXT:allso} told me that in the fields {TEXT:feilds}, in summer,

HOBSON-173X-2,316.689

It happened that as his man and boy were ploughing in a close where
there had lately been some wood stubbed, the plough happened to touch
upon a sheet of lead in which there was money hid.  HOBSON-173X-2,316.690

The man looses the draught, HOBSON-173X-2,316.691

and he says there has often been money found there since, as they have
been ploughing, which he supposes was scattered out of the lead when
