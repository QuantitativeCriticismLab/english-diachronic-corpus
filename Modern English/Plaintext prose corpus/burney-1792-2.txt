{ED:PART_XLVI._1792}

<font> January.  <$$font> BURNEY-1792-2,5,51.3

- I had a very civil note from Mrs. Schwellenberg, telling me that
Miss Goldsworthy was ill, which made Miss Gomme necessary to the <P_5,52>
Princesses, and therefore, as Mlle. Jacobi was still lame, Her
Majesty wished for my attendance on Wednesday noon.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.4

I received this little summons with very sincere pleasure,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.5

and sent a warm acknowledgment for its honour.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.6

I was engaged for the evening to Mr. Walpole, now Lord Orford
, by my father, who promised to call for me at the Queen's house.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.7

At noon I went thither, BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.8

and saw, by the carriages, their Majesties were just arrived from Windsor.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.9

In my way upstairs I encountered the Princess Sophia.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.10

I really felt a pleasure at her sight, so great that I believe I saluted
her; BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.11

I hardly know; BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.12

but she came forward, with her hands held out, so good humoured and so
sweetly, I was not much on my guard.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.13

How do I wish I had gone that moment to my Royal Mistress, while my mind
was fully and honestly occupied with the most warm satisfaction in being
called again into her presence!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.14

The Princess Sophia desired me to send her Miss Gomme, whom she said I
should find in my own room.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.15

Thither I went, BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.16

and we embraced very cordially; BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.17

but she a little made me stare by saying"Do you sleep in your old bed?
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.18

"No,"I answered, BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.19

"I go home after dinner"; BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.20

and she said no more, BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.21

but told me she must have two hours'conference alone with me, from the
multiplicity of things she had to discuss with me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.22

We parted then, BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.23

and I proceeded to Mrs. Schwellenberg.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.24

There I was most courteously received, and told I was to go at night to
the play.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.25

I replied I was extremely sorry, but I was engaged.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.26

She looked deeply displeased, BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.27

and I was forced to offer to send an excuse.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,52.28

Nothing, however, <P_5,53> was settled; BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.29

she went to the Queen, whither I was most eager to follow,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.30

but I depended upon her arrangement, BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.31

and could not go uncalled.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.32

I returned to my own room, as they all still call it,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.33

and Miss Gomme and Miss Planta both came to me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.34

We had a long discourse upon matters and things.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.35

By and by Miss Gomme was called out to Princesses Mary and Amelia;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.36

she told them who was in the old apartment, BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.37

and they instantly entered it.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.38

Princess Mary took my hand, BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.39

and said repeatedly,"My dear Miss Burney, how glad I am to see you
again! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.40

and the lovely little Princess Amelia kissed me twice, with the sweetest
air of affection.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.41

This was a very charming meeting to me, BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.42

and I expressed my real delight in being thus allowed to come amongst
them again, in the strongest and truest terms.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.43

I had been but a short time alone, when Westerhaults came to ask
me if I had ordered my father's carriage to bring me from the play.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.44

I told him I was engaged, but would give up that engagement, and endeavour
to secure being fetched home after the play.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.45

Mrs. Schwellenberg then desired to see me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.46

"What $do {TEXT:"do"_missing} you mean by going home? "cried she,
somewhat deridingly: BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.47

"know you not you might sleep here? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.48

I was really thunderstruck; so weak still, and so unequal as I feel
to undertake night and morning attendance, which I now saw expected.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.49

I was obliged, however, to comply; BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.50

and I wrote a note to Sarah, and another note to be given to my father,
when he called to take me to Lord Orford.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.51

But I desired we might go in chairs, and not trouble him for the carriage.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,53.52

This arrangement, and my dread of an old attendance I was so little
refitted for renewing, had <P_5,54> so much disturbed me before I
was summoned to the Queen, that I appeared before her without any of
the glee and spirits with which I had originally obeyed her commands.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.53

I am still grieved at this circumstance, as it must have made me seem
cold and insensible to herself, when I was merely chagrined at the
peremptory mismanagement of her agent.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.54

Mr. de Luc was with her.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.55

She was gracious, but by no means lively or cordial.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.56

She was offended, probably, BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.57

- and there was no reason to wonder, and yet no means to clear away
the cause.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.58

This gave me much vexation, BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.59

and the more I felt it the less I must have appeared to merit her
condescension.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.60

Nevertheless, after she was dressed she honoured me with a summons to
the White Closet, where I presently felt as much at home as if I had
never quitted the Royal residence.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.61

She inquired into my proceedings, BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.62

and I began a little history of my south-west tour; which she
listened to till word was brought the King was come from the Levee:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.63

dinner was then ordered, BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.64

and I was dismissed.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.65

At our dinner, the party, in the old style, was Mr. de Luc,
Miss Planta, Mrs. Stainforth, and Miss Gomme; BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.66

Mrs. Schwellenberg was not well enough to leave her own apartment,
except to attend the Queen.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.67

We were gay enough, I own; BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.68

my spirits were not very low in finding myself a guest at that table,
where I was so totally unfit to be at home, and whence, nevertheless,
I should have been very much and deeply concerned to have found myself
excluded, since the displeasure of the Queen could alone have procured
such a banishment.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.69

Besides, to visit, I like the whole establishment, however inadequate I
found them for supplying the place of all I quitted to live with them.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.70

Oh, who could succeed there?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,54.71

<P_5,55>

During the dessert the Princess Elizabeth came into the room.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.73

I was very glad, by this means, to see all this lovely female tribe.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.74

As soon as she was gone I made off to prepare for the play, with fan,
cloak, and gloves.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.75

At the door of my new old room who should I encounter but Mr.
Stanhope?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.76

He was all rapture, in his old way, at the meeting, BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.77

and concluded me, I believe, reinstated.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.78

I got off as fast as possible, BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.79

and had just shut myself in, and him out, when I heard the voice of the
King, who passed my door to go to the dining-room.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.80

I was quite chagrined to have left it so unseasonably, as my whole heart
yearned to see him.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.81

He stayed but a minute, BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.82

and I heard him stop close to my door, and speak with Mr. de Luc.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.83

The loudness of his voice assuring me he was saying nothing he meant to be
unheard, I could not resist softly opening my door.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.84

I fancy he expected this, BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.85

for he came up to me immediately, BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.86

and with a look of goodness almost amounting to pleasure - I believe
I may say quite - he inquired after my health, and its restoration,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.87

and said he was very glad to see me again.  Then turning gaily to
Mr. de Luc,"And you, Mr. de Luc,"he cried,"are not you,
too, very glad to see Miss Beurni again? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.88

I told him, very truly, the pleasure with which I had re-entered his roof.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.89

He made me stand near a lamp, to examine me, BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.90

and pronounced upon my amended looks with great benevolence:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.91

and, when he was walking away, said aloud to Mr. de Luc,
who attended him,"I dare say she was very willing to come! "
BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.92

I heard afterwards from Miss Gomme that the King came to the eating-room
purposely to see me, as he told the Princesses.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,55.93

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell you how grateful I feel for such
condescending goodness; <P_5,56> and how invariably I experienced it
during my whole residence under his roof.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.94

Our party in the box for the Queen's attendants consisted of Lady
Catherine Stanhope, Miss Planta, Major Price, Greville Upton, and
Mr. Frank Upton.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.95

The King and Queen and six Princesses sat opposite.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.96

It was to me a lovely and most charming sight.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.97

The Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York and his bride, with the Duke
of Clarence, sat immediately under us.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.98

I saw the Duchess now and then, BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.99

and saw that she has a very sensible and marked countenance, but no
beauty.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.100

She was extremely well received by the people, and smiled at in the most
pleasing manner by her opposite new relations.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.101

The play was <font> Cymon, <$$font> with alterations, etc.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.102

At night I once more attended the Queen, BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.103

and it seemed as strange to me as if I had never done it before.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.104

The next day, Thursday, the Queen gave up the drawing-room, on account
of a hurt on her foot.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.105

I had the honour of another very long conference in the White Closet,
in which I finished the account of my late travels, and during which
, though she was very gracious, she was far less communicative than
heretofore, saying little herself, and making me talk almost all.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.106

When I attended the Queen again to-night, the strangeness was so entirely
worn away, that it seemed to me as if I had never left my office!
And so again on Friday morning.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.107

At noon the Royal Family set off for Windsor.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,56.108

The Queen graciously sent for me before she <P_5,57> went, to bid me
good-bye, BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.109

and condescended to thank me for my little services.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.110

I would have offered repetition with all my heart, BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.111

but I felt my frame unequal to such business.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.112

Indeed I was half dead with only two days'and nights'exertion.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.113

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} amazing how I ever went through all that is passed.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.114

<font> February.  <$$font> BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.115

- I shall begin this month at the 13th, the day I left my dearest friends.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.116

I found our small family at home in much the same state I had left it;
my dear father, however, rather worse than better, and lower and more
depressed about himself than ever.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.117

To see him dejected is, of all sights, to me the most melancholy, his
native cheerfulness having a character of such temperate sweetness,
that there is no dispensing with any of it, as its utmost vigour never
a moment overpowers.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.118

Among the tickets I found of visitors during my absence, I was much
pleased to see the name of Mr. Bryant.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.119

Good and kind old man!  how much I should like to see him again!
BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.120

And I found also, waiting my return, a note from Mrs.
Schwellenberg, with an offer of a ticket for Mr. Hastings's trial,
the next day, if I wished to go to it.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.121

I did wish it exceedingly, no public subject having ever so deeply
interested me; BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.122

but I could not recollect any party I could join, BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.123

and therefore I proposed to Captain Phillips to call on his Court friend,
and lay before her my difficulty.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.124

He readily declared he would do more, BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.125

for he would frankly ask her for a ticket for himself, and stay another
day, merely to accompany me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.126

You know well the kind pleasure and zeal with which he is always ready
to discover and propose expedients in distress.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,57.127

<P_5,58>

His visit prospered, BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.129

and we went to Westminster Hall together.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.130

All the managers attended at the opening, BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.131

but the attendance of all others was cruelly slack.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.132

To hear the attack, the people came in crowds; BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.133

to hear the defence, they scarcely came in <font> te`te-a`-te`tes
<$$font>!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.134

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} barbarous there should be so much more pleasure
given by the recital of guilt than by the vindication of innocence!
BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.135

Mr. Law spoke the whole time; BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.136

he made a general harangue in answer to the opening general harangue of
Mr. Burke, BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.137

and he spoke many things that brought forward conviction in favour of
Mr. Hastings; BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.138

but he was terrified exceedingly, BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.139

and his timidity induced him to so frequently beg quarter from his
antagonists, both for any blunders and any deficiencies, that I felt
angry with even modest egotism, when I considered that it was rather his
place to come forward with the shield and armour of truth, undaunted,
and to have defied, rather than deprecated, the force of talents when
without such support.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.140

None of the managers quitted their box, BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.141

and I am uncertain whether or not any of them saw me.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.142

Mr. Windham, in particular, I feel satisfied either saw me not,
or was so circumstanced, as manager, that he could not come to speak
with me; BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.143

for else, this my first appearance from that parental roof under which
he has so largely contributed to replace me would have been the last
time for his dropping my acquaintance.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.144

Mr. Sheridan I have no longer any ambition to be noticed by;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.145

and Mr. Burke, at this place, I am afraid I have already
displeased, so unavoidably cold and frigid did I feel myself when he
came here to me formerly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,58.146

Anywhere else, I should bound <P_5,59> forward to meet him, with respect,
and affection, and gratitude.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.147

In the evening I went to the Queen's house.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.148

I found Mrs. Schwellenberg, who instantly admitted me, at cards
with Mr. de Luc.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.149

Her reception was perfectly kind; BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.150

and when I would have given up the tickets, she told me they were the
Queen's, who desired, if I wished it, I would keep them for the season.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.151

This was a pleasant hearing upon every account, BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.152

and I came away in high satisfaction.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.153

A few days after, I went again to the trial, BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.154

and took another Captain for my esquire - my good and ever-affectionate
James.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.155

The Hall was still more empty, both of Lords and Commons, and of ladies
too, than the first day of this session.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.156

I am quite shocked at the little desire there appears to hear Mr.
Hastings's defence.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.157

When the managers entered, James presently said,"$Here $'s {TEXT:Here's}
Mr. Windham coming to speak to you. " BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.158

And he broke from the procession, as it was descending to its cell,
to give me that pleasure.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.159

His inquiries about my health were not, as he said, <font> mere <$$font>
common inquiries; BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.160

but, without any other answer to them than a bow, I interrupted their
course by quickly saying,"You have been excursioning and travelling all
the world o'er since I saw you last. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.161

He paid me in my own coin with only a bow, hastily going back to myself
: BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.162

"But your tour,"he cried,"to the West, after all that -
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.163

I saw what was following, BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.164

and, again abruptly stopping him,"But here you are returned ,"I cried,"to
all your old labours and toils again. " BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.165

"No, no,"cried he, half laughing,"not labours and toils always ;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.166

they are growing into pleasures now. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,59.167

"$That $'s {TEXT:That's} being very good, very liberal, indeed, "<P_5,60>
quoth I, supposing him to mean hearing the defence made the pleasure;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.168

but he stared at me with so little concurrence, that, soon understanding
he only meant bringing their charges home to the confusion of the culprit
, I stared again a little while, and then said,"You sometimes accuse me
of being ambiguous; BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.169

I think you seem so yourself, now! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.170

"To nobody but you,"cried he, with a rather reproachful accent.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.171

"Oh, now,"cried I,"you are not ambiguous, BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.172

and I am all the less pleased. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.173

"People,"cried James, <font> bonnement <$$font>,"$do $n't {TEXT:don't}
like to be convinced. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.174

"Mr. Hastings,"said Mr. Windham,"does not convince ,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.175

he does not bring conviction home. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.176

"Not to you,"quoth I, returning his accent pretty fully.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.177

"Why, true,"answered he very candidly; BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.178

"there may be something in that. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.179

"How is it all to be? "cried James.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.180

"Is the defence to go on long, BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.181

and are they to have any evidence; BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.182

or how? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.183

"We $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know this part of the business,"said Mr.
Windham, smiling a little at such an upright, downright question;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.184

"it is Mr. Hastings's affair now to settle it:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.185

however, I understand he means to answer charge after charge as
they were brought against him, first by speeches, then by evidence:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.186

however, this is all conjecture. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.187

We then spoke of Mr. Law, Mr. Hastings's first counsel,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.188

and I expressed some dissatisfaction that such attackers should not have
had abler and more equal opponents.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.189

"But do you not think Mr. Law spoke well? "cried he;" clear,
forcible? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.190

"Not forcible,"cried I.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.191

I would not say not clear.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.192

"He was frightened,"said Mr. Windham, BURNEY-1792-2,5,60.193

"he <P_5,61> might not do himself justice.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.194

I have heard him elsewhere, and been very well satisfied with him;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.195

but he looked pale and alarmed, BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.196

and his voice trembled. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.197

"I was very well content with his materials,"quoth I,"which I thought
much better than the use he made of them; BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.198

and, once or twice, he made an opening that, with a very little skill,
might most adroitly and admirably have raised a laugh against you all.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.199

He looked a little askew, I must own, BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.200

but he could not help smiling: BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.201

and shall I now lose my privileged sincerity when I made it the basis
of speaking with him on this subject?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.202

Certainly not.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.203

I gave him an instance in point, which was the reverse given by
Mr. Law to the picture drawn by Mr. Burke of Tamerlane,
in which he said those virtues and noble qualities bestowed upon him by
the honourable manager were nowhere to be found but on the British stage.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.204

Now this, seriously, with a very little ingenuity, might have
placed Mr. Burke at the head of a company of comedians.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.205

This last notion I did not speak, however; BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.206

but enough was understood, BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.207

and Mr. Windham looked straight away from me, without answering ;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.208

nevertheless, his profile, which he left me, showed much more disposition
to laugh than to be incensed.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.209

Therefore I proceeded; pointing out another lost opportunity that
, well saved, might have proved happily ridiculous against them;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.210

and this was Mr. Law's description of the real state of India
, even from its first discovery by Alexander, opposed to Mr.
Burke's flourishing representation of its golden age, its lambs and
tigers associating, etc., etc. BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.211

Still he looked askew; BURNEY-1792-2,5,61.212

but I believe he is truth <P_5,62> itself, BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.213

for he offered no defence, though, of course, he would not enter into
the attack.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.214

And surely at this critical period I must not spare pointing out all
he will submit to hear, on the side of a man of whose innocence I am so
fully persuaded.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.215

"I must own, however,"continued I, finding him still attentive, though
silent,"Mr. Law provoked me in one point - his apologies for his
own demerits.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.216

Why should he contribute his humble mite to your triumphs?
BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.217

and how little was it his place to extol your superior talents!
as if you were not self-sufficient enough already, without his aid!
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.218

Unless you had heard the speech of Mr. Law, you can hardly imagine
with what timid flattery he mixed every exertion he ventured to make in
behalf of his client; BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.219

and I could not forbear this little observation, because I had taken
notice with what haughty derision the managers had perceived the fears
of their importance, which were felt even by the very counsel of their
prisoner.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.220

Mr. Windham, too, who himself never looks either insolent or
deriding, must be sure what I meant BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.221

for his associates could not include himself.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.222

He did not, however, perfectly welcome the remark; BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.223

he still only gave me his profile, BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.224

and said not a word, - BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.225

so I went on.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.226

Mr. Hastings little thinks what a pleader I am become in his cause
, against one of his most powerful adversaries.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.227

"There was still another thing,"quoth I,"in which I felt vexed with
Mr. Law: BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.228

how could he be so weak as to beg quarter from you, and to humbly hope
that, if any mistake, any blunder, any improvident word escaped him, you
would have the indulgence to spare your ridicule?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,62.229

Oh yes, to be sure!  when I took notice at the moment of his supplication,
and before any error committed, <P_5,63> that every muscle of every face
amongst you was at work from the bare suggestion.  "BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.230

He could not even pretend to look grave now, BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.231

but, turning frankly towards me, said,"Why, Mr. Fox most justly
observed upon that petition, that, if any man makes a blunder , a mistake,
$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} very well to apologise: but it was singular to hear
a man gravely preparing for his blunders and mistakes, and wanting to
make terms for them beforehand. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.232

"I like him for this,"cried James again <font> bonnement <$$font>,"that
he seems so much interested for his client. " BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.233

"Will you give me leave to inquire,"quoth I,"one thing?
BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.234

You know my old knack of asking strange questions. "
BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.235

He only bowed - archly enough, I assure you.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.236

"Did I fancy, or was it fact, that you were a flapper to Mr. Burke,
when Mr. Law charged him with disingenuity, in not having recanted
the accusation concerning Devy Sing?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.237

He appeared to me in much perturbation, BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.238

and I thought by his see-saw he was going to interrupt the speech:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.239

did you prevent him? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.240

"No, no,"he answered,"I did not: BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.241

I did not think him in any danger. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.242

He rubbed his cheek, though, as he spoke, as if he did not much like
that circumstance.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.243

Oh that Mr. Burke - so great, so noble a creature - can in this
point thus have been warped!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.244

I ran off to another scene, BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.245

and inquired how he had been amused abroad, and, in particular, at the
National Assembly?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.246

"Indeed,"he answered,"it was extremely curious for a short time;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.247

but there is little variety in it, BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.248

and therefore it will not do long. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,63.249

I was in a humour to be just as sincere here, as <P_5,64> about the
trial; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.250

so you democrats must expect no better.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.251

"I understand,"quoth I,"there is a great dearth of abilities in this
new Assembly; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.252

how then should there be any variety? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.253

"No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say that: BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.254

they do not want abilities; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.255

but they have no opportunity to make their way. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.256

"Oh! "quoth I, shaking my wise head,"abilities, real abilities, make
their own way. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.257

"Why, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} true; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.258

but, in that Assembly, the noise, the tumult -"BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.259

"Abilities,"again quoth I,"have power to quell noise and tumult.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.260

"Certainly, in general; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.261

but not in France.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.262

These new legislative members are so solicitous to speak, so anxious to
be heard, that they prefer uttering any tautology to listening to others
; and when once they have begun, they go on with what speed they may,
and without selection, rather than stop.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.263

They see so many ready to seize their first pause, they know they have
so little chance of a second hearing, that I never entered the Assembly
without being reminded of the famous old story of the man who patiently
bore hearing a tedious harangue, by saying the whole time to himself,
'Well, well, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} his turn now; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.264

but let him beware how he sneezes. '"BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.265

James now again asked some question of their intentions with regard to
the progress of the trial.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.266

He answered,"We have nothing to do with its present state.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.267

We leave Mr. Hastings now to himself, and his own set.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.268

Let him keep to his cause, and he may say what he will.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.269

We do not mean to interfere, nor avail ourselves of our privileges.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.270

Mr. Hastings was just entered; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.271

I looked down at him, BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.272

and saw his half motion to kneel; BURNEY-1792-2,5,64.273

I could <P_5,65> not bear it, BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.274

and, turning suddenly to my neighbour,"Oh, Mr. Windham,
"I cried,"after all, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis}, indeed, a barbarous
business! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.275

This was rather further than I meant to go, BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.276

for I said it with serious earnestness; BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.277

but it was surprised from me by the emotion always excited at sight of
that unmerited humiliation.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.278

He looked full at me upon this solemn attack, and with a look of chagrin
amounting to displeasure, saying,"It is a barbarous business <font>
we <$$font> have had to go through. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.279

I did not attempt to answer this, BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.280

for, except through the medium of sport and raillery, I have certainly
no claim upon his patience.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.281

But, in another moment, in a tone very flattering, he said,"I do
not understand, nor can any way imagine, how you can have been thus
perverted! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.282

"No, no! "quoth I,"it is you who are perverted! " BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.283

Here Mr. Law began his second oration, BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.284

and Mr. Windham ran down to his cell.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.285

I fancy this was not exactly the conversation he expected upon my first
enlargement.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.286

However, though it would very seriously grieve me to hurt or offend him, I
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} refuse my own veracity, nor Mr. Hastings's
injuries, the utterance of what I think truth.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.287

Mr. Law was far more animated and less frightened,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.288

and acquitted himself so as to merit almost as much <font> e`loge
<$$font> as, in my opinion, he had merited censure at the opening.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.289

It was all in answer to Mr. Burke's general exordium and attack.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.290

I had the satisfaction some days after to see again the good,
and much-injured, and most unfortunate Mr. Beckford.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.291

He is at length released from unjust confinement, BURNEY-1792-2,5,65.292

but he has an air of <P_5,66> dejection, a look, a voice, a manner,
that all speak the term of his sufferings to have been too long for his
spirits to recruit.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.293

How hard a case!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.294

I wish to read his account of Jamaica; BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.295

I hear it much commended.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.296

He is now writing a History of France.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.297

I understand both to have been compiled in his prison!
BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.298

How praiseworthy to have made such an exertion of his abilities, which
sorrow and resentment must else have soured and corroded for life!
BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.299

At Mrs. Ord's, one morning, I had the happiness to meet Mr.
Smelt; BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.300

he looks again very ill.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.301

He supports, he told me, a fevered being, that will soon dissolve,
to his ultimate joy.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.302

No man could ever more completely devote his whole mind to the object
of his affection; BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.303

his happiness was all centred in her life, BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.304

and is wholly buried with her ashes!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.305

I met, that same morning, Miss Fanshaw: BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.306

she had spent the preceding evening, she said, very singularly;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.307

she had heard the famous M. Lally Tolendahl read a French tragedy
upon an English subject, written by himself!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.308

The subject was the death of Strafford.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.309

He read it to a large but chosen company, at Lady Herries's.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.310

I should much like to have heard it.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.311

Upon the day of Sir Joshua Reynolds's death I was in my bed, with two
blisters, BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.312

and I did not hear of it till two days after.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.313

I shall enter nothing upon this subject here; BURNEY-1792-2,5,66.314

our current letters mentioned <P_5,67> the particulars,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.315

and I am not desirous to retrace them.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.316

His loss is as universally felt as his merit is universally acknowledged
, BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.317

and, joined to all public motives, I had myself private ones of regret
that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} subside.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.318

He was always peculiarly kind to me, BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.319

and he had worked at my deliverance from a life he conceived too laborious
for me, as if I had been his own daughter; BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.320

yet, from the time of my coming forth, I only twice saw him.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.321

I had not recovered strength for visiting before he was past receiving me.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.322

I grieve inexpressibly never to have been able to pay him the
small tribute of thanks for his most kind exertions in my cause.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.323

I little thought the second time I saw him would be my last opportunity
, BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.324

and my intention was to wait some favourable opening.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.325

Miss Palmer is left heiress, BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.326

and her unabating attendance upon her inestimable uncle in his
sickroom makes everybody content with her great acquisition.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.327

I am sure she loved and admired him with all the warmth of her warm heart.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.328

I wrote her a few lines of condolence, BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.329

and she has sent me a very kind answer.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.330

She went immediately to the Burkes, with whom she will chiefly, I fancy,
associate.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.331

<font> March.  <$$font> BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.332

- Sad for the loss of Sir Joshua, and all of us ill ourselves, we began
this month.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.333

Upon its third day was his funeral.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.334

My dear father could not attend; BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.335

but Charles was invited BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.336

and went.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.337

All the Royal Academy, professors and students, and all the Literary Club,
attended as family mourners.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.338

Mr. Burke, Mr. Malone, and Mr. Metcalf, are
executors.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.339

Miss Palmer has spared nothing, either in thought or expense, that could
render the last honours splendid and grateful.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,67.340

It <P_5,68> was a very melancholy day to us; though it had the alleviation
and softening of a letter from our dear Charlotte, promising to arrive
the next day.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.341

<font> April.  <$$font> BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.342

- This wayward month opened upon me with none of its smiles:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.343

sickness and depression pervaded our household.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.344

I shall now pass from the 8th, when the combined forces of Mrs.
Ord's rhetoric and Charles's activity removed me from sickness and
sinking to the salubrious hills of Norbury, and the balsamic medicine
of social tenderness, to my return to my dear father, April 18, when
I found him but little better, and far from such a state as could have
made me happy in absence.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.345

Gradually, however, he has been recruiting, though I have no hope of
his entire restoration before the dog-days.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.346

I paid my duty at the Queen's house, in inquiring after Her Majesty ,
where I was extremely well received by Mrs. Schwellenberg, and
saw Miss Planta and Mr. de Luc.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.347

My next visiting opportunity carried me to Mrs. Montagu:
BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.348

she let me in, BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.349

and showed me her new room, which was a double gratification to me, from
the elegant paintings by our ingenious Edward.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.350

You will have heard this fine room described by Mr. Lock;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.351

my Susanna, and you, my Fredy, I hope have seen it.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.352

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} a very beautiful house indeed, and now completely
finished.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.353

There was a lady with Mrs. Montagu whose name I never gathered,
but who frequently addressed herself to me, in talking of my dearest
Fredy, and making inquiries about her health.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.354

So I liked her very well, though else she was but a commonish,
non-nothingish sort of a good-humoured and sensiblish woman!
BURNEY-1792-2,5,68.355

Then I went to Lady Mary Duncan, who was <P_5,69> grotesquely comic,
and remarkably vulgar, and zealously kind, and ludicrously sarcastic,
as usual.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.356

Have you read Miss Knight's <font> Dinarbas, or Continuation of Rasselas
<$$font>?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.357

If you can forgive the presumption of the idea, I think you must be
pleased with the execution.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.358

She has now just published a new work, <font> Marcus Flaminius, or the
Life of the Romans.  <$$font> BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.359

She has much surprised me by sending me a very elegantly bound copy,
by Mr. Hoole, who has been her editor.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.360

I think it a work of great merit, though wanting in variety, and not very
attractive from much interesting the feelings.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.361

But to Italian travellers, who are classic readers, I imagine it must
be extremely welcome, in reviving images of all they have seen, well
combined and contrasted with former times of which they have read.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.362

The sentiments interspersed are so good I wish for more;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.363

and the principles that are meant to be recommended are both pure
and lofty.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.364

It is not a work which you will read quickly through, or with ardour,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.365

but it is one, I think, of which you will not miss a word.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.366

<font> April <$$font> 23.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.367

I thought myself equal to again going to the trial, which recommenced
after six or seven weeks'cessation, on account of the Judges going
the circuit.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.368

Sarah went with me: BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.369

I am now so known in the Chamberlain's box that the door-keepers
and attendants make way for me without looking at my ticket.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.370

And to be sure, the Managers on one side, and Mr. Hastings's
friends and counsel on the other, must pretty well have my face by heart.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.371

I have the faces of all them, most certainly, in full mental possession
; BURNEY-1792-2,5,69.372

and the figures of many whose names I know not are so familiar now to
my eyes, that should I chance <P_5,70> hereafter to meet them, I shall
be apt to take them for old acquaintances.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.373

There was again a full appearance of Managers to accompany Mr.
Burke in his entry; BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.374

and again Mr. Windham quitted the procession, as it descended to
the box, BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.375

and filed off to speak with me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.376

He made the most earnest inquiries after the health of my dearest father,
as well as after my own.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.377

He has all the semblance of real regard and friendship for us,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.378

and I am given to believe he wears no semblance that has not a real and
sympathetic substance couched beneath.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.379

His manner instantly revived in my mind my intent not to risk, with him ,
the loss of making those poor acknowledgments for his kindness, that I
so much regret omitting to Sir Joshua Reynolds.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.380

In return to his inquiries about my renovating health, I answered that
I had again been very ill since I saw him last, BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.381

and added,"Indeed, I believe I did not come away too soon.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.382

"And now,"cried I,"I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} resist giving myself the
pleasure of making my acknowledgments for what I owe to you upon this
subject.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.383

I have been, indeed, very much obliged, by various things that have come
round to me, both to you and to Sir Joshua - BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.384

Oh what a loss is that! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.385

"What a wretched loss! "cried he: BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.386

and we then united our warmest suffrages in his favour, with our deepest
regret for our deprivation.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.387

Here I observed poor Mr. Hastings was brought in.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.388

I saw he was fixing him.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.389

"And can you,"I cried, fixing <font> him, <$$font>"can you have so
much compassion for one captive, and still have none for another?
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.390

"Have you, then, still,"cried he,"the same sentiments?
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.391

"Have you,"cried I,"heard all thus far of the defence,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.392

and are you still unmoved? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,70.393

<P_5,71>

"Unmoved? "cried he, emphatically; BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.395

"shall I be moved by a lion?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.396

You see him there in a cage, BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.397

and pity him; BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.398

look back to when you might have seen him with a lamb in his claws!
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.399

I could only look dismayed for a moment.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.400

"But, at least,"I said,"I hope what I hear is not true, though I now
grow afraid to ask? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.401

"If it is anything about me,"he answered,"it is certainly not
true. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.402

"I am extremely glad, indeed,"cried I, BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.403

"for it has been buzzed about in the world that you were to draw up the
final charge.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.404

This I thought most cruel of all; that you, who have held back all this
time -"BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.405

"Yes!  pretty completely,"interrupted he, laughing.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.406

"No, not completely,"I continued; BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.407

"but yet you have made no direct formal speech, BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.408

nor have come forward in any positive and formidable manner;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.409

therefore, as we have now heard all the others, and - almost enough -
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.410

I was obliged to stop a moment, to see how this adventurous plainness
was taken; BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.411

and he really, though my manner showed me only rallying, looked I $do
$n't {TEXT:don't} know how, at such unexampled disrespect towards his
brother-orators.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.412

But I soon went quietly on:"To come forth now, after all that has
passed, with the <font> e`clat <$$font> of novelty, and, - for the most
cruel part of all, - that which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be answered.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.413

"You think,"cried he,"$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} bringing a fresh courser
into the field of battle, just as every other is completely jaded?
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.414

"I think,"cried I,"that I am very generous to wish against what I should
so much wish for, but for other considerations.  "BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.415

"Oh, what a flattering way,"cried he,"of stating it!
BURNEY-1792-2,5,71.416

however, I can bear to allow you a <P_5,72> little waste of compliments,
which you know so well how to make; BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.417

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear to have you waste your compassion.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.418

Mr. Plomer now rose to speak, BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.419

and he only added,"Oh!  I must go down to help the show":
BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.420

and away he ran.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.421

Mr. Plomer spoke in a clear and manly manner,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.422

and brought forward truths and facts in favour of Mr. Hastings,
the most satisfactory.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.423

What amends can that persecuted man ever receive?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.424

<font> May.  <$$font> BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.425

- The first of this month I went again to Westminster Hall, with our
cousin Elizabeth.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.426

Evidence was brought forward by the counsel for Mr. Hastings,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.427

and Lord Stormont was called upon as a witness.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.428

This produced some curious debating among the Lords, and with the
Chancellor.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.429

They spoke only for the ears of one another, as it was merely to settle
some ceremonial, whether he was to be summoned to the common place where
the witnesses stood, or had the claim of a peer to speak in his place,
robed.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.430

This latter prevailed: BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.431

and then we expected his speech; BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.432

but no, a new debate ensued, which, as we gathered from the rumour about
us, was that his Lordship should have the Prayer Book, for his oath,
belonging to the House of Peers.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.433

Here, also, his dignity was triumphant, though it cost the whole assembly
a full quarter of an hour; while another Prayer Book was officially at
hand, in the general post for plebeian witnesses.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.434

Well!  aristocrat as I am, compared with you, I laughed heartily at all
this mummery; BURNEY-1792-2,5,72.435

and yet it was possibly wise, at this period of pulling down <P_5,73>
all law and order, all privilege and subordination, however frivolous
was its appearance.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.436

His testimony was highly favourable to Mr. Hastings, with regard
to authenticating the intelligence he had received of an opening war with
France, upon which hung much justification of the measures Mr.
Hastings had pursued for raising supplies.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.437

All the rest of the day was upon the same business, and bringing forward
the same clearing.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.438

Thence I went to the Queen's house, where I have a most cordial general
invitation from Mrs. Schwellenberg to go by all opportunities;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.439

and there is none so good as after the trial, that late hour exactly
according with her dinner-time.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.440

She is just as she was in respect to health; BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.441

but in all other respects, oh how amended!  all civility, all
obligingness, all courtesy!  and so desirous to have me visit her,
that she presses me to come incessantly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.442

Mr. de Luc and Miss Mawer were of the party.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.443

During coffee, the Princess Royal came into the room.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.444

She condescended to profess herself quite glad to see me;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.445

and she had not left the room five minutes before, again returning,
she said,"Mrs. Schwellenberg, I am come to plague you,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.446

for I am come to take away Miss Burney. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.447

I give you leave to guess whether this plagued me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.448

<font> May <$$font> 2.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.449

The following week I again went to Westminster Hall.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.450

Mlle. Jacobi had made a point of accompanying me, that
she might see the show, as James called it to General Burgoyne,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.451

and I had great pleasure in taking her, BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.452

for she is a most ingenuous and good creature, though - alas!  - by no
means the same undaunted, gay, open character as she appeared at first.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,73.453

Sickness, confinement, <P_5,74> absence from her friends, submission
to her coadjutrix, and laborious watching, have much altered her.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.454

The trial of this day was all written evidence in favour of Mr.
Hastings, and violent quarrelling as to its admissibility on the part
of Mr. Burke.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.455

Mr. Windham took his place, during some part of the controversy ,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.456

and spoke ably and clearly as to the given point in dispute, but with
the most palpable tremor and internal struggle.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.457

I wonder, so"tremblingly"as he is"alive all o'er,"how he ever made the
first effort to become a public speaker; BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.458

but having conquered that opening horror, I wonder yet more, with
such ability, readiness, knowledge, facility, and command of language,
he has not totally vanquished the difficulties of public exhibition.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.459

I can only suppose that by nature he is extremely diffident, and by
inclination equally ambitious; BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.460

and if so, the conflict may last through life.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.461

I attended Mlle. Jacobi to the Queen's house, where I dined;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.462

and great indeed was my pleasure, during coffee, to see the Princess
Elizabeth, who, in the most pleasing manner and the highest spirits,
came to summon me to the Queen.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.463

I found Her Majesty again with all her sweet daughters but the youngest.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.464

She was gracious and disposed to converse.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.465

We had a great deal of talk upon public concerns, BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.466

and she told me a friend of mine had spoken very well the day before,
and so had Mr. Burke.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.467

She meant Mr. Windham.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.468

It was against the new societies, and in favour of the Proclamation.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.469

Mr. Burke, of course, would here come forth in defence of his
own predictions and opinions; BURNEY-1792-2,5,74.470

but Mr. Windham, who had rather abided hitherto with <P_5,75>
Charles Fox, in thinking Mr. Burke too extreme, well as
he loves him personally, was a new convert highly acceptable.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.471

He does not, however, go all lengths with Mr. Burke;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.472

he is only averse to an unconstitutional mode of reform, and to
sanctioning club powers, so as to enable them, as in France, to overawe
the state and senate.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.473

Soon after, to my infinite joy, the King entered.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.474

Oh, he spoke to me so kindly!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.475

- he congratulated me on the better looks which his own presence and
goodness gave me, repeatedly declaring he had never seen me in such
health.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.476

He asked me after my father, BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.477

and listened with interest when I mentioned his depression, and told him
that all he had done of late to soothe his retirement and pain had been
making canons to solemn words, and with such difficulties of composition
as, in better health and spirits, would have rather proved oppressive
and perplexing than a relief to his feelings.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.478

"I, too,"said the King, after a very serious pause,"have myself sometimes
found, when ill or disturbed, that some grave and even difficult
employment for my thoughts has tended more to compose me than any of
the supposed usual relaxations. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.479

He also condescended to ask after little Norbury, taking off the eager
little fellow while he spoke, and his earnest manner of delivery.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.480

He then inquired about my friends Mr. and Mrs. Lock
, and their expectations of the return of Mr. William.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.481

He inquired how I lived, whom I saw, what sort of neighbours I had in
the college, and many other particulars, that seemed to desire to know
how I went on, and whether I was comfortable.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.482

His looks, I am sure, said so, and most kindly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,75.483

They kept me till they went to the Japan Room, where they meet
the officers and ladies who attend <P_5,76> them in public.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.484

They were going to the Ancient Music.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.485

This dear King, nobly unsuspicious where left to himself, and where he
has met no doubleness, spoke also very freely of some political matters
before me - of the new association in particular.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.486

It gratified me highly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.487

One day again, in the following week, I went to Mr. Hastings's
defence: BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.488

Sarah was with me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.489

Just before us sat Mrs. Kennedy, of Windsor, with whom I renewed
a meeting acquaintance, but evaded a visiting one.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.490

Soon after a grave man's voice behind me said,"Is not that Miss
Burney? "BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.491

I twirled round BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.492

and saw the Bishop of Dromore, and Mrs. Percy and her two
daughters.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.493

We immediately renewed our Bath acquaintance.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.494

The defence to-day was by Mr. Markham, son of the Archbishop of
York, who has repeatedly been summoned, and who bears most honourable
testimony to the character, the conduct, and the abilities of Mr.
Hastings.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.495

Soon after I spent a day with Mrs. Ord, by invitation, for meeting
the Percy family.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.496

She had also assembled Major Rennell, the Dickensons, Lady Herries,
and Mr. Selwin.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.497

Mr. Selwin I had not seen for many years.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.498

Streatham and Mrs. Thrale, our constant themes, were uppermost,
first and last, in all we said and all we thought.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,76.499

His most amiable behaviour in <P_5,77> poor Mr. Thrale's unhappy
state of health I shall never forget.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.500

I met him with a glad cordiality from its remembrance,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.501

and it was very apparently mutual.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.502

He still visits, occasionally, at Streatham; BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.503

but he says the place, the inhabitants, the visitors, the way of life,
are all so totally changed, it would make me most melancholy again to
tread those boards.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.504

All the public talk was upon the East India letters from Lord Cornwallis
, BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.505

and Major Rennell was there our oracle.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.506

He has a plain, unadorned way of giving information, that is both pleasant
and masterly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.507

Mrs. Dickenson told me that Miss Palmer is certainly engaged to
Lord Inchiquin.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.508

He is sixty-nine; BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.509

but they say he is remarkably pleasing in his manners, and soft and
amiable in his disposition.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.510

I am sure she has merited my wishes for her happiness, by her deep
interest, upon all occasions, in mine, BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.511

and I am sure she has them.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.512

Mrs. Bunbury was with her sister, and looking as beautiful as
she would let herself look; BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.513

for she uses so much art, that, in my eyes, she loses more by such
assistance than she could do, with features so fine as hers, by the
fading of those years she means to conceal.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.514

The Colonel came in while we stayed, BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.515

and we had much old talk upon past services in common.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.516

I got home to dinner to meet Mrs. and Miss Mary Young, who are
in town for a few weeks.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.517

Miss Mary is sensible, and quick, and agreeable.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.518

They give a very unpleasant account of Madame de Genlis, or de Sillery,
or Brulard, as she is now called.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,77.519

They say she has established herself at <P_5,78> Bury, in their
neighbourhood, with Mlle. la Princesse d'Orle`ans and Pamela
, and a <font> Circe, <$$font> another young girl under her care.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.520

They have taken a house, the master of which always dines with them,
though Mrs. Young says he is such a low man he should not dine
with her daughter.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.521

They form twenty with themselves and household.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.522

They keep a botanist, a chemist, and a natural historian always with them.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.523

These are supposed to have been common servants of the Duke of Orleans
in former days, as they always walk behind the ladies when abroad;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.524

but, to make amends in the new equalising style, they all dine together
at home.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.525

They visit at no house but Sir Thomas Gage's, where they carry their
harps, and frequently have music.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.526

They have been to a Bury ball, BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.527

and danced all night; Mlle. d'Orle`ans with anybody, known or
unknown to Madame Brulard.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.528

What a woful change from that elegant, amiable, high-bred Madame de
Genlis I knew six years ago!  the apparent pattern of female perfection
in manners, conversation, and delicacy.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.529

There are innumerable democrats assembled in Suffolk; among them the
famous Tom Paine, who herds with all the farmers that will receive him,
and there propagates his pernicious doctrines.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.530

The next time I went to Westminster I took Miss Mary Young.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.531

It was again upon the same evidence of Mr. Markham, which
proves very important indeed in Mr. Hastings's favour.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.532

<font> Friday, May.  <$$font> 25.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.533

This morning I went to a very fine public breakfast, given by Mrs.
Montagu.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,78.534

The instant I came into the gallery I had the melancholy satisfaction
of being seen by Sir George <P_5,79> Howard.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.535

There is no affectation mixed with his sorrow for poor Lady Effingham.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.536

I had not met him since her loss.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.537

He had tears in his eyes immediately; BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.538

but he spoke with cheerfulness, BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.539

and asked after my dear father very kindly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.540

Mrs. Montagu I saw next, BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.541

and she was extremely courteous.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.542

They were all very sorry to miss my father, who, indeed, has everywhere
been missed this winter and spring.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.543

When I came into the Feather Room I was accosted by Mr. Seward,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.544

and he entered into a gay conversation upon all sorts of subjects,
which detained me, agreeably enough, in a very pleasant station by one
of the windows.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.545

He had a gentleman with him, whom I half recollected, and whom he
soon introduced by the name of"my friend Mrs. Boscawen's son.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.546

It was Lord Falmouth, with whom I had dined at Commissioner La Forey's,
at Plymouth Dock.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.547

He was as entertaining here as he had been there.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.548

I then made for the dining-room, which was filled for a breakfast,
upon this occasion, and very splendidly, though, to me, who have so
long been familiar to sights and decorations, no show of this sort is
new or striking.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.549

A sight that gave me far more pleasure was Mrs. Ord and her
daughter, BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.550

and I immediately joined them for the rest of the morning.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.551

The table was not a matter of indifference to the guests at large;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.552

and it was so completely occupied by company seated round it, that it
was long before one vacant chair could be seized, BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.553

and this fell to the lot of Miss Ord.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.554

The crowd of company was such that we could only slowly make way in
any part.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,79.555

There could <P_5,80> not be fewer than four or five hundred people.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.556

It was like a full Ranelagh by daylight.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.557

We now met Mrs. Porteus; BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.558

and who should be with her but the poor pretty S. S.,
whom so long I had not seen, and who has now lately been finally
given up by her long-sought and very injurious lover, Dr. Vyse.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.559

She is sadly faded, BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.560

and looked disturbed and unhappy; but still beautiful, though no longer
blooming; and still affectionate, though absent and evidently absorbed.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.561

We had a little chat together about the Thrales.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.562

In mentioning our former intimacy with them,"Ah, those,"she cried,
"were happy times! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.563

and her eyes glistened.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.564

Poor thing!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.565

hers has been a lamentable story!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.566

- Imprudence and vanity have rarely been mixed with so much sweetness,
and good-humour, and candour, and followed with more reproach and ill
success.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.567

We agreed to renew acquaintance next winter; BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.568

at present she will be little more in town.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.569

We went then round the rooms, which were well worth examination and
admiration: BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.570

and we met friends and acquaintance every other step.  Amongst them,
Major Rennell, whom I always like to meet; Miss Coussmaker; Lady Rothes ,
who has been to Chelsea, but whom I have not yet been able to wait upon ;
Dr. Russel, who was in high spirits, and laughed heartily at seeing
the prodigious meal most of the company made of cold chicken, ham, fish,
etc., and said he should like to see Mrs. Montagu make the
experiment of inviting all the same party to dinner at three o'clock.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.571

"Oh! "they would cry,"three o'clock!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.572

What does she mean?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.573

- who can dine at three o'clock?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.574

- one has no appetite - BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.575

one $can $n't {TEXT:can't} swallow a morsel - BURNEY-1792-2,5,80.576

<P_5,81>

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} altogether impossible! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.578

- Yet, let her invite the same people, and give them a dinner, while she
calls it a breakfast, and see but how prettily they can find appetites.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.579

While we were examining the noble pillars in the new room, I heard an
exclamation of"<font> Est-ce possible?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.580

suis-je si heureuse?  BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.581

- Est-ce ma che`re Mlle. Beurni que je vois? ?  <$$font>
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.582

Need I say this was Madame de la Fite?  or Mrs. Fitt, as, since
the French Revolution, of which she is a favourer, she is called by some
of the household to which I belonged.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.583

I spoke so as to moderate this rapture into something less calling for
attention, which her voice and manner were engaging not unwillingly.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.584

I had not seen her since my retreat, BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.585

and, if she had been less pompous, I should have been glad of the meeting,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.586

she kept my hand close grasped between both her own <paren> though her
fan nipped one of my fingers till I was ready to make faces <$$paren>
, with a most resolute <font> empressement, <$$font> to the great
inconvenience of those who wanted to pass, BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.587

for we were at one of the entrances into the great new room;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.588

and how long she might have continued this fond detention I know not,
if a lady, whose appearance vied for show and parade with Madame de la
Fite's manner and words, had not called out aloud,"I am extremely happy
indeed to see Miss Burney! "BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.589

This was Mrs. Hastings; BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.590

and to answer her I was let loose.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.591

I have always been very sorry that Mrs. Hastings, who is a
pleasing, lively, and well-bred woman, with attractive manners and
attentions to those she wishes to oblige, should have an indiscretion
so peculiarly unsuited to her situation, as to aim always at being the
most conspicuous figure wherever she appears.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,81.592

Her dress now was like <P_5,82> that of an Indian princess,
according to our ideas of such ladies, and so much the most splendid
, from its ornaments, and style, and fashion, though chiefly of
muslin, that everybody else looked under-dressed in her presence.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.593

It is for Mr. Hastings I am sorry when I see this inconsiderate
vanity, in a woman who would so much better manifest her sensibility of
his present hard disgrace, by a modest and quiet appearance and demeanour.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.594

I had a very good beau in Major Rennell, who took charge of any catering
and regale.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.595

Dr. Russel also made up to our little coterie;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.596

and Lord Mulgrave surprised, and also frightened me, by his changed
appearance and more than ever hollow voice, when he suddenly came to
speak to me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.597

I had not seen him since an assembly at Mrs. Ord's, when he was
there with his sweet bride.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.598

He looks quite ghastly.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.599

He is in an atrophy, and fast, I doubt, quitting this world.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.600

<font> Wednesday, May <$$font> 30.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.601

To-day I went to Westminster Hall again, to hear the evidence of
Mr. Markham, which is so pleasantly in favour of Mr.
Hastings, that all the friends of that persecuted man are gratified by
all he deposes.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.602

Miss Ord accompanied me.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.603

When the impetuous and ungovernable Mr. Burke was interrupting
the Chancellor, in order to browbeat Mr. Hastings's evidence,
Mr. Windham involuntarily exclaimed,"Hist! "just as if he
had been at his elbow, and playing the kind part of a flapper.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.604

I could not help laughing, and half joining him: BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.605

he echoed back my laugh, and with a good-humour that took in all its
meaning and acknowledged its sympathy with regard to Mr. Burke;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.606

nevertheless, he spoke not a word.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,82.607

Afterwards, however, he spoke when I had far <P_5,83> rather he had been
silent, BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.608

for he went to the assistance of Mr. Burke.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.609

Michael Angelo Taylor spoke also; BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.610

but I observed with pleasure a distinction the Chancellor made to
Mr. Windham; BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.611

for, when he answered their arguments, he singled him out as the person
who had said what alone he meant upon that question to notice, by saying
,"The honourable manager who spoke second. "BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.612

But I am sure - I think so, at least - Mr. Windham as little
approves the violence of Mr. Burke in this trial as I do myself.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.613

I see him evidently and frequently suffer great pain and mortification
when he is so obstreperous.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.614

<font> June <$$font> 1.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.615

- This day had been long engaged for breakfasting with Mrs.
Dickenson and dining with Mrs. Ord.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.616

The breakfast guests were Mr. Langton, Mr. Foote, Mr.
Dickenson, jun., a cousin, and a very agreeable and pleasing man;
Lady Herries, Miss Dickenson, another cousin, and Mr. Boswell.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.617

This last was the object of the morning.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.618

I felt a strong sensation of that displeasure which his loquacious
communications of every weakness and infirmity of the first and greatest
good man of these times have awakened in me, at his first sight;
BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.619

and, though his address to me was courteous in the extreme, and he made
a point of sitting next me, I felt an indignant disposition to a nearly
forbidding reserve and silence.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.620

How many starts of passion and prejudice has he blackened into record,
that else might have sunk, for ever forgotten, under the preponderance
of weightier virtues and excellences!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.621

Angry, however, as I have long been with him, he soon insensibly
conquered, though he did not soften me: BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.622

there is so little of ill design or ill nature in him,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,83.623

he is so open and forgiving for all that is <P_5,84> said in return ,
that he soon forced me to consider him in a less serious light, and change
my resentment against his treachery into something like commiseration
of his levity; BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.624

and before we parted we became good friends.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.625

There is no resisting great good-humour, be what will in the opposite
scale.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.626

He entertained us all as if hired for that purpose, telling stories
of Dr. Johnson, and acting them with incessant buffoonery.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.627

I told him frankly that, if he turned him into ridicule by caricature,
I should fly the premises: BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.628

he assured me he would not, BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.629

and indeed his imitations, though comic to excess, were so far from
caricature that he omitted a thousand gesticulations which I distinctly
remember.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.630

Mr. Langton told some stories himself in imitation of Dr.
Johnson; BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.631

but they became him less than Mr. Boswell, BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.632

and only reminded me of what Dr. Johnson himself once said to
me -"Every man has, some time in his life, an ambition to be a wag.
"BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.633

If Mr. Langton had repeated anything from his truly great friend
quietly, it would far better have accorded with his own serious and
respectable character.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.634

After this, I went to Mrs. Ord for the day.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.635

I found there the charming Mrs. Garrick, whom I always cordially
delight to see; BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.636

but she was not well, BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.637

and could not stay.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.638

In the evening we had a large and pleasant party: Mrs. Montagu,
Mrs. Boscawen, Lady Hesketh, Mr. and Mrs. Pepys,
Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins Brown, Mrs. E. Hervey,
Dr. Russel, Lady Herries, Mr. and Mrs. Dickenson,
Mr. Bardon, and Mr. Batt.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,84.639

<P_5,85>

I had much very interesting and informing conversation with Mr.
Batt, who is among my high favourites.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.641

He is just returned from France, BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.642

and he gave me such an account of the situation and disposition of things,
and of the proceedings of the National Assembly, as, from his authority, I
should certainly write for the benefit of such democrats as only hear and
seek the presiding powers'account of themselves; if I had not a sinking
within upon the subject, from the excess of horror with which my informer
made me look forward to probable consequences.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.643

<font> June <$$font> 4.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.644

- The birthday of our truly good King.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.645

As His Majesty had himself given me, when I saw him after the Queen's
birthday, an implied reproach for not presenting myself at the palace
that day, I determined not to incur a similar censure on this, especially
as I hold my admission on such a national festival as a real happiness,
as well as honour, when it is to see themselves.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.646

How different was my attire from every other such occasion the five
preceding years!  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.647

It was a mere simple dressed undress, without feathers, flowers, hoop,
or furbelow.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.648

When I alighted at the porter's lodge, I was stopped from crossing
the courtyard, by seeing the King, with his three sons, the Prince of
Wales, Duke of York, and Duke of Clarence, who were standing there after
alighting from their horses, to gratify the people who encircled the
iron rails.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.649

It was a pleasant and goodly sight, BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.650

and I rejoiced in such a detention.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.651

I had a terrible difficulty to find a friend who would make known to
Her Majesty that I was come to pay my devoirs.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.652

At length, while watching in the passages to and fro, I heard a step
upon the Princesses'stairs, BURNEY-1792-2,5,85.653

<P_5,86>

and, venturing forward, I encountered the Princess Elizabeth.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,86.655

I paid my respectful congratulations on the day, which she most pleasantly
received, BURNEY-1792-2,5,86.656

and I intimated my great desire to see Her Majesty.
BURNEY-1792-2,5,86.657

I am sure the amiable Princess communicated my petition,
BURNEY-1792-2,5,86.658

for Mr. de Luc came out in a few minutes BURNEY-1792-2,5,86.659

and ushered me into the Royal presence.  BURNEY-1792-2,5,86.660
