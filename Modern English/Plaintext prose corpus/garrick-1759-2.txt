Act I.  GARRICK-1759-2,1.4

Scene I.  GARRICK-1759-2,1.5

A Hall in Mr. Heartly's House.  GARRICK-1759-2,1.6

<$$heading>

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles Clackit, <font> his <$$font> Nephew,
<font> and <$$font> Servant.  GARRICK-1759-2,1.8

Servant.  Please to walk this Way, Sir.  GARRICK-1759-2,1.9

Sir Charles.  Where is your Master, Friend?  GARRICK-1759-2,1.10

Servant.  In his Dressing-Room, Sir.  GARRICK-1759-2,1.11

Y. Clackit.  Let him know then - GARRICK-1759-2,1.12

<P_2>

Sir Charles.  $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} be quiet, <font> Jack <$$font>
; GARRICK-1759-2,2.14

when I am in Company let me direct.  GARRICK-1759-2,2.15

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} proper and decent.  GARRICK-1759-2,2.16

Y. Clackit.  I am dumb, Sir.  GARRICK-1759-2,2.17

Sir Charles.  Tell Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font>, his Friend and
Neighbour, Sir <font> Charles Clackit <$$font>, would say three words
to him.  GARRICK-1759-2,2.18

Servant.  I shall, Sir - GARRICK-1759-2,2.19

<bracket> <font> Exit.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,2.20

Sir Charles.  Now Nephew, consider once again, before I open the Matter
to my Neighbour <font> Heartly <$$font>, what I am going to undertake
for you.  GARRICK-1759-2,2.21

- Why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you speak?  GARRICK-1759-2,2.22

Y. Clackit.  Is it proper and decent, Uncle?  GARRICK-1759-2,2.23

Sir Charles.  Pshaw!  $do $n't {TEXT:don't} be a Fool -
GARRICK-1759-2,2.24

but answer me - GARRICK-1759-2,2.25

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} you flatter yourself.  GARRICK-1759-2,2.26

- What Assurance have you that this young Lady, my Friend's Ward, has
a liking to you?  GARRICK-1759-2,2.27

The young Fellows of this Age are all Coxcombs, GARRICK-1759-2,2.28

and I am afraid, you are no Exception to the general Rule.
GARRICK-1759-2,2.29

Y. Clackit.  Thank you Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,2.30

But may I this Instant be struck old and peevish, if I would put you upon
<P_3> a false Scent to expose you for all the fine Women in Christendom.
GARRICK-1759-2,3.31

- I assure you again and again, and you may take my Word, Uncle, that
Miss <font> Harriet <$$font> has no kind of Aversion to your Nephew and
most humble Servant.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.32

Sir Charles.  Ay, ay, - Vanity!  - Vanity!  GARRICK-1759-2,3.33

- but I never take a young Fellow's Word about Women; GARRICK-1759-2,3.34

$they $'ll {TEXT:they'll} lye as fast, and with as little Conscience,
as the <font> Brussels Gazette.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,3.35

- Produce your Proofs.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.36

Y. Clackit.  $Ca $n't {TEXT:Can't} your Eyes see'em, Uncle,
without urging me to the Indelicacy of repeating'em.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.37

Sir Charles.  Why I see nothing but a Fool's Head and a Fool's Coat,
supported by a pair of most unpromising Legs.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.38

Have you no better Proofs?  GARRICK-1759-2,3.39

Y. Clackit.  Yes, I have, my good Infidel Uncle, half a hundred.
GARRICK-1759-2,3.40

Sir Charles.  Out with them then.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.41

Y. Clackit.  First then - Whenever I see her, she never looks
at me.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.42

- $That $'s {TEXT:That's} a Sign of Love.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.43

- Whenever I speak to her, she never answers me.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.44

- Another Sign of Love.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.45

- And whenever I speak to any Body else, she seems to be perfectly easy.
GARRICK-1759-2,3.46

- $That $'s {TEXT:That's} a certain Sign of Love.  GARRICK-1759-2,3.47

<P_4>

Sir Charles.  The Devil it is!  GARRICK-1759-2,4.49

Y. Clackit.  When I am with her, $she $'s {TEXT:she's} always
grave; GARRICK-1759-2,4.50

and the Moment I get up to leave her, then the poor Thing begins - "Why
will you leave me,"Mr. <font> Clackit <$$font>; GARRICK-1759-2,4.51

$can $n't {TEXT:can't} you sacrifice a few Moments to my Bashfulness?
GARRICK-1759-2,4.52

- Stay, you agreeable Runaway, GARRICK-1759-2,4.53

stay, GARRICK-1759-2,4.54

I shall soon overcome the Fears your Presence gives me. "
GARRICK-1759-2,4.55

- I cou'd say more, GARRICK-1759-2,4.56

- But a Man of Honour, Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,4.57

Sir Charles What, and has she said all these Things to you?
GARRICK-1759-2,4.58

Y. Clackit.  O yes, and ten times more - with her Eyes.
GARRICK-1759-2,4.59

Sir Charles With her Eyes!  GARRICK-1759-2,4.60

- Eyes are very equivocal, <font> Jack <$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,4.61

However, if the young Lady has any Liking to you, Mr. <font>
Heartly <$$font> is too much a Man of the World, and too much my Friend,
to oppose the Match; GARRICK-1759-2,4.62

so do you walk into the Garden, GARRICK-1759-2,4.63

and I will open the Matter to him.  GARRICK-1759-2,4.64

Y. Clackit Is there any Objection to my staying, Uncle?
GARRICK-1759-2,4.65

The Business will be soon ended.  GARRICK-1759-2,4.66

- You will propose the Match, GARRICK-1759-2,4.67

he will give his Consent, GARRICK-1759-2,4.68

I shall give mine, GARRICK-1759-2,4.69

Miss is sent for, GARRICK-1759-2,4.70

and <font> l'affair est fait.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,4.71

<bracket> <font> Snapping his Finger.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,4.72

<P_5>

Sir Charles.  And so you think that a young beautiful Heiress, with Forty
Thousand Pounds, is to be had with a Scrap of <font> French <$$font>,
and a Snap of your Finger.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.74

- $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} get away, GARRICK-1759-2,5.75

and $do $n't {TEXT:don't} provoke me.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.76

Y. Clackit.  Nay, but, my dear Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,5.77

Sir Charles Nay, but my impertinent Nephew, either retire, or $I $'ll
{TEXT:I'll} throw up the Game.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.78

<bracket> <font> Putting him out.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,5.79

Y. Clackit.  Well, well, I am gone, Uncle.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.80

- When you come to the Point, I shall be ready to make my Appearance.
GARRICK-1759-2,5.81

- <font> Bon Voyage!  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,5.82

<bracket> <font> Exit.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,5.83

Sir Charles.  The $Devil $'s {TEXT:Devil's} in these young Fellows,
I think - GARRICK-1759-2,5.84

We send'em abroad to cure their Sheepishness, GARRICK-1759-2,5.85

and they get above Proof the other way.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.86

- <font> <paren> Enter Mr. <$$font> Heartly.  <$$paren> -
GARRICK-1759-2,5.87

Good Morrow to you, Neighbour.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.88

Heartly.  And to you, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, GARRICK-1759-2,5.89

I am glad to see you so strong and healthy.  GARRICK-1759-2,5.90

<P_6>

Sir Charles.  I can return you the Compliment, my Friend, - Without
Flattery GARRICK-1759-2,6.92

you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} look more than Thirty-five; GARRICK-1759-2,6.93

and between ourselves, you are on the wrong Side of Forty -
GARRICK-1759-2,6.94

But Mum for that.  GARRICK-1759-2,6.95

Heartly.  Ease and Tranquility keep me as you see.  GARRICK-1759-2,6.96

Sir Charles.  Why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you marry Neighbour?
GARRICK-1759-2,6.97

A good Wife would do well for you.  GARRICK-1759-2,6.98

Heartly.  For me?  GARRICK-1759-2,6.99

you are pleased to be merry Sir <font> Charles.  <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,6.100

Sir Charles.  No faith, I am serious, GARRICK-1759-2,6.101

and had I a Daughter to recommend to you, you should say me nay more
than once, I assure you, Neighbour <font> Heartly <$$font>, before I
would quit you.  GARRICK-1759-2,6.102

Heartly.  I am much obliged to you.  GARRICK-1759-2,6.103

Sir Charles.  But indeed, you are a little too much of the
Philosopher, to think of being troubled with Women and their Concerns.
GARRICK-1759-2,6.104

Heartly.  I beg your Pardon {COM:sic_no_comma} Sir <font> Charles <$$font>
- GARRICK-1759-2,6.105

Tho'there are many, who call themselves Philosophers, that live single
, and perhaps are in the right of it, yet I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
think that Marriage is at all inconsistent <P_7> with true Philosophy.
GARRICK-1759-2,7.106

- A wise Man will resolve to live like the rest of the World, with this
only Difference, that he is neither a Slave to Passions nor Events.
GARRICK-1759-2,7.107

- It is not because I have a little Philosophy, but because I am on
the wrong Side of Forty {COM:sic_no_comma} Sir <font> Charles <$$font>,
that I desire to be excused <font> <paren> smiling <$$paren>.  <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,7.108

Sir Charles.  As you please, Sir, - GARRICK-1759-2,7.109

and now to my Business - GARRICK-1759-2,7.110

You have no Objection I suppose to tie up your Ward, Miss <font> Harriet
<$$font>, though you have slipped the Collar yourself - Ha!  ha!  ha!
GARRICK-1759-2,7.111

Heartly.  Quite the contrary, Sir; GARRICK-1759-2,7.112

I have taken her some time from the Boarding School, and brought her
home, in order to dispose of her worthily, with her own Inclination.
GARRICK-1759-2,7.113

Sir Charles.  Her Father, I have heard you say, recommended
that particular Care to you, when she had reached a certain Age.
GARRICK-1759-2,7.114

Heartly.  He did so - GARRICK-1759-2,7.115

and I am the more desirous to obey him scrupulously in this Circumstance,
as she will be a most valuable Acquisition to the Person who shall gain
her - GARRICK-1759-2,7.116

for, not to mention her Fortune, which is the least Consideration,
her Sentiments are worthy her Birth; GARRICK-1759-2,7.117

she is gentle, modest, and obliging.  GARRICK-1759-2,7.118

- In a Word, my Friend, I never saw Youth more amiable or discreet,
GARRICK-1759-2,7.119

- but perhaps I am a little partial to her.  GARRICK-1759-2,7.120

<P_8>

Sir Charles.  No, no, she is a delicious Creature, GARRICK-1759-2,8.122

every body says so.  GARRICK-1759-2,8.123

- But I believe, Neighbour, something has happened that you little think
$of {TEXT:off}.  GARRICK-1759-2,8.124

Heartly.  What, pray Sir <font> Charles?  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,8.125

Sir Charles.  My Nephew, Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,8.126

<font> Enter <$$font> Young Clackit, GARRICK-1759-2,8.127

Y. Clackit.  Here I am at your Service, Sir, - GARRICK-1759-2,8.128

My Uncle is a little unhappy in his Manner; GARRICK-1759-2,8.129

but $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} clear the Matter in a Moment -
GARRICK-1759-2,8.130

Miss <font> Harriet <$$font>, Sir, - Your Ward.  GARRICK-1759-2,8.131

- Sir Charles.  Get away, you Puppy!  GARRICK-1759-2,8.132

Y. Clackit, Miss <font> Harriet <$$font>, Sir, your Ward, -
a most accomplish'd young Lady, to be sure - GARRICK-1759-2,8.133

Sir Charles.  Thou art a most accomplish'd Coxcomb, to be sure.
GARRICK-1759-2,8.134

Heartly.  Pray, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, let the young Gentleman
speak.  GARRICK-1759-2,8.135

<P_9>

Y. Clackit.  $You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} excuse me, Mr. <font>
Heartly <$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,9.137

My Uncle does not set up for an Orator, - a little confused, or so,
Sir, GARRICK-1759-2,9.138

- You - see me what I am, GARRICK-1759-2,9.139

- But I ought to ask Pardon for the young Lady and myself.
GARRICK-1759-2,9.140

- We are young Sir, GARRICK-1759-2,9.141

must confess we were wrong to conceal it from you, GARRICK-1759-2,9.142

- but my Uncle I see is pleased to be angry, GARRICK-1759-2,9.143

and therefore, I shall say no more at present.  GARRICK-1759-2,9.144

Sir Charles.  If you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} leave the Room this Moment,
and stay in the Garden, till I call you - GARRICK-1759-2,9.145

Y. Clackit.  I am sorry I have displeased you -
GARRICK-1759-2,9.146

I did not think it was <font> mal-a-propos <$$font>; GARRICK-1759-2,9.147

but you must have your way Uncle - GARRICK-1759-2,9.148

You command - GARRICK-1759-2,9.149

I submit - GARRICK-1759-2,9.150

Mr. <font> Heartly, <$$font> your's.  GARRICK-1759-2,9.151

<bracket> <font> Exit Young <$$font> Clackit.  GARRICK-1759-2,9.152

Sir Charles.  Puppy!  <font> <paren> aside <$$paren> <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,9.153

My $Nephew $'s {TEXT:Nephew's} a little unthinking, Mr. <font>
Heartly <$$font>, as you see, GARRICK-1759-2,9.154

and therefore I have been a little cautious how I have proceeded in this
Affair: GARRICK-1759-2,9.155

But indeed, he has perswaded me in a Manner, that your Ward and he are
not ill together.  GARRICK-1759-2,9.156

Heartly.  Indeed!  This is the first Notice I have had of it,
GARRICK-1759-2,9.157

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} conceive why Miss <font> Harriet <$$font>
should conceal it from me; GARRICK-1759-2,9.158

for I have often assured her, <P_10> that I would never oppose her
Inclination, though I might endeavour to direct it.  GARRICK-1759-2,10.159

Sir Charles.  $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} human Nature, Neighbour, -
GARRICK-1759-2,10.160

We are so ashamed of our first Passion, that we would willingly hide it
from ourselves - GARRICK-1759-2,10.161

But will you mention my Nephew to her.  GARRICK-1759-2,10.162

Heartly.  I must beg your Pardon, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>,
GARRICK-1759-2,10.163

- The Name of the Gentleman whom she chuses, must first come from herself,
- GARRICK-1759-2,10.164

My Advice or Importunity shall never influence her: GARRICK-1759-2,10.165

If Guardians would be less rigorous, young People would be more
reasonable; GARRICK-1759-2,10.166

and I am so unfashionable to think, that Happiness in Marriage $can $n't
{TEXT:can't} be bought too dear.  GARRICK-1759-2,10.167

I am still on the wrong Side of Forty, Sir <font> Charles.  <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,10.168

Sir Charles.  No, no, - You are right Neighbour, GARRICK-1759-2,10.169

- But here she is, GARRICK-1759-2,10.170

- $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} alarm her young Heart too much, I beg of you,
GARRICK-1759-2,10.171

- Upon my Word, she is a sweet Morsel.  GARRICK-1759-2,10.172

I shall not reproach you with any thing, but keeping your Wishes a Secret

Miss Harriet.  - Upon my Word, Sir, GARRICK-1759-2,11.188

- <font> Lucy!  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,11.189

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} lay my Life $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} a Treaty of Marriage.
GARRICK-1759-2,11.191

- Is that such a dreadful Thing?  GARRICK-1759-2,11.192

Oh, for shame, Madam!  Young Ladies of Fashion are not frightened at
such Things now a days.  GARRICK-1759-2,11.193

Heartly <font> to Sir <$$font> Charles.  We have gone too far, Sir <font>
Charles <$$font>, GARRICK-1759-2,11.194

GARRICK-1759-2,11.195

- I had better talk with her alone; GARRICK-1759-2,11.196

we will leave her now; GARRICK-1759-2,11.197

- Be perswaded that no Endeavours shall be wanting on my Part, to bring
this Affair to a happy and a speedy Conclusion.  GARRICK-1759-2,11.198

Sir Charles I shall be obliged to you, Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font>

Young Lady your Servant.  GARRICK-1759-2,11.200

<P_12>

She is a most engaging Creature, GARRICK-1759-2,12.203

and I shall be proud to make her one of my Family.  GARRICK-1759-2,12.204

<bracket> <font> Exeunt Sir <$$font> Charles <font> and <$$font> Heartly.
GARRICK-1759-2,12.206

Lucy.  Indeed, Miss <font> Harriet <$$font>, you are very particular ;
GARRICK-1759-2,12.207

you was tired of the Boarding School, GARRICK-1759-2,12.208

and yet seem to have no Inclination to be married - GARRICK-1759-2,12.209

What can be the Meaning of all this?  GARRICK-1759-2,12.210

- That smirking old Gentleman is Uncle to Mr. <font> Clackit
<$$font>; GARRICK-1759-2,12.211

and, my Life for it, he has made some Proposals to your Guardian.
GARRICK-1759-2,12.212

Miss Harriet.  $Pray $thee {TEXT:Prithee} $do $n't {TEXT:don't} plague
me about Mr. <font> Clackit.  <$$font> GARRICK-1759-2,12.213

Lucy.  But why not, Miss?  GARRICK-1759-2,12.214

Tho'he is a little fantastical, loves to hear himself talk, and is
somewhat self-sufficient; you must consider he is young, has been abroad,
and keeps good Company: GARRICK-1759-2,12.215

- The trade will soon be at an end, if young Ladies and Gentlemen grow
over nice and exceptious.  GARRICK-1759-2,12.216

Miss Harriet.  But if I can find one without these Faults, I may surely
please myself.  GARRICK-1759-2,12.217

Lucy.  Without these Faults!  GARRICK-1759-2,12.218

and is he young, Miss?  GARRICK-1759-2,12.219

Miss Harriet.  He is sensible, modest, polite, affable, and generous ;
GARRICK-1759-2,12.220

and charms from the natural Impulses of his <P_13> own Heart, as much
as others disgust by their senseless Airs, and insolent Affectation.
GARRICK-1759-2,13.221

Lucy.  Upon my word!  GARRICK-1759-2,13.222

- But why have you kept this Secret so long?  GARRICK-1759-2,13.223

- Your Guardian is kind to you beyond Conception.  GARRICK-1759-2,13.224

- What Difficulties can you have to overcome?  GARRICK-1759-2,13.225

Miss Harriet.  Why the Difficulty of declaring my Sentiments.
GARRICK-1759-2,13.226

Lucy.  Leave that to me, Miss.  GARRICK-1759-2,13.227

- But your Spark, with all his Accomplishments, must have very little
Penetration not to have discovered his good Fortune in your Eyes.
GARRICK-1759-2,13.228

Miss Harriet.  I take care that my Eyes $do $n't {TEXT:don't} tell too
much; GARRICK-1759-2,13.229

and he has too much Delicacy to interpret Looks to his Advantage.
GARRICK-1759-2,13.230

Y. Clackit.  Upon my Soul, Gentlemen, I am as much surprized at

Sir Charles.  $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you what, <font> Jack <$$font>

I have offered to marry her, GARRICK-1759-2,26.479

is not that a Proof sufficient that I like her?  GARRICK-1759-2,26.480

A young Fellow <P_27> must have some Affection that will go such lengths

GARRICK-1759-2,27.485

This young Gentleman has certainly touch'd her - GARRICK-1759-2,32.577

There are some Objections to him, GARRICK-1759-2,32.578

and among so many young Men of Fashion that fall in her way, she certainly
might have made a better Choice: GARRICK-1759-2,32.579

She has an Understanding to be sensible of this; GARRICK-1759-2,32.580

and, if I am not mistaken, it is a Struggle between her Reason and her
Passion, that occasions all this Confusion.  GARRICK-1759-2,32.581

- $You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} pardon me, my Dear.  GARRICK-1759-2,33.587

- Miss Harriet.  I have reflected, that the Person for whom I have
conceiv'd most tender Regard, may, from the wisest Motives, doubt of my
Passion; GARRICK-1759-2,33.588

and therefore I would endeavour to answer all his Objections, and convince
him how deserving he is of my highest Esteem.  GARRICK-1759-2,33.589

GARRICK-1759-2,40.723

But what can be the Meaning of it?  GARRICK-1759-2,40.724

- Ho, ho, - I think I have a Glimmering at last.  GARRICK-1759-2,40.725

- Suppose she shou'd not like young Shatter-brains after all;
GARRICK-1759-2,40.726

and indeed she has never absolutely said she did; GARRICK-1759-2,40.727

who knows but she has at last opened her Mind to my good Master,
GARRICK-1759-2,40.728

and he, finding her Taste <paren> like that of other Girls at her Age

he used to be.  GARRICK-1759-2,40.729

- What a Shame it is that I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know more of this

inquisitive as I ought to be?  GARRICK-1759-2,40.730

It is an Affront to my Character, GARRICK-1759-2,40.731

and I must have Satisfaction immediately.  GARRICK-1759-2,40.732

- <font> <paren> Going.  <$$paren> <$$font> I will go directly to my

GARRICK-1759-2,40.733

GARRICK-1759-2,40.737

- What am I {COM:"to"_missing_in_text} think of it then?
GARRICK-1759-2,40.738

- Let a Man be ever so much upon his Guard against the Approaches
of Vanity, yet he will find himself weak in that Quarter.
GARRICK-1759-2,40.739

- Had not my Reason made a little Stand against my Presumption, I might
have interpreted some of <font> Harriet's <$$font> Words in my own Favour
; GARRICK-1759-2,40.740

but - <P_41> I may well blush, tho'alone, at my extravagant Folly!
GARRICK-1759-2,41.741

- Can it be possible that so young a Creature shou'd even cast a Thought
of that kind upon me?  - Upon me!  GARRICK-1759-2,41.742

Presumptuous Vanity!  GARRICK-1759-2,41.743

- No, no, - I will do her and myself the Justice to acknowledge that,
for a very few slight Appearances, there are a thousand Reasons that
destroy so ridiculous a Supposition.  GARRICK-1759-2,41.744

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Charles.  GARRICK-1759-2,41.745

Sir Charles.  Well, Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font>, what are we to
hope for?  GARRICK-1759-2,41.746

Heartly.  Upon my Word, Sir, I am still in the Dark; GARRICK-1759-2,41.747

we puzzle about, indeed, GARRICK-1759-2,41.748

but we $do $n't {TEXT:don't} get forward.  GARRICK-1759-2,41.749

Sir Charles.  What the Devil is the Meaning of all this?
GARRICK-1759-2,41.750

There never sure were Lovers so difficult to bring together.
GARRICK-1759-2,41.751

But have you not been a little too rough with the Lady?
GARRICK-1759-2,41.752

For as I pass'd by her but now, she seem'd a little out of Humour,
- And, upon my Faith, not the less beautiful for a little pouting.
GARRICK-1759-2,41.753

Heartly.  Upon my Word, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, what I can collect
from her Behaviour is, that your Nephew is not so much in her good Graces,
as he made you believe.  GARRICK-1759-2,41.754

Sir Charles. 'Egad, like enough; GARRICK-1759-2,41.755

- But hold, hold, GARRICK-1759-2,41.756

- this must be look'd a little into; GARRICK-1759-2,41.757

- if it is so, I wou'd be glad to know, why, and wherefore, I have been
made so ridiculous.  GARRICK-1759-2,41.758

- Eh, Master <P_42> <font> Heartly <$$font>, does he take me for his Fool,
his Beast, his Merry Andrew?  GARRICK-1759-2,42.759

By the Lord <font> Harry <$$font> - GARRICK-1759-2,42.760

Heartly.  In him a little Vanity is excusable.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.761

Sir Charles.  I am his Vanity's humble Servant for that tho'.
GARRICK-1759-2,42.762

- Heartly.  He is of an Age, Sir <font> Charles <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,42.763

Sir Charles.  Ay, of an Age to be very impertinent; GARRICK-1759-2,42.764

but I shall desire him to be less free with his Uncle for the future,
I assure him.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.765

<font> Enter <$$font> Lucy.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.766

Lucy.  I have it, I have it, Gentlemen!  GARRICK-1759-2,42.767

You need not puzzle any more about the Matter.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.768

- I have got the Secret.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.769

- I know the Knight-Errant that has wounded our distress'd Lady.
GARRICK-1759-2,42.770

Sir Charles.  Well, and who?  And what, Child?  GARRICK-1759-2,42.771

Lucy.  What, has not she told you, Sir?  <font> <paren> To <$$font>
Heartly.  <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,42.772

Heartly.  Not directly.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.773

Lucy.  So much the better.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.774

- What Pleasure it is to discover a Secret, and then tell it to all
the World!  GARRICK-1759-2,42.775

I press'd her so much, that she at last confess'd.  GARRICK-1759-2,42.776

<P_43>

Sir Charles.  Well, what?  GARRICK-1759-2,43.778

Lucy.  That, in the first place, she did not like your Nephew.
GARRICK-1759-2,43.779

Sir Charles.  And I told the Puppy so.  GARRICK-1759-2,43.780

Lucy.  That she had a most mortal Antipathy for the young Men of this
Age; and that she had settled her Affections upon one of riper Years,
and riper Understanding.  GARRICK-1759-2,43.781

Sir Charles.  Indeed?  GARRICK-1759-2,43.782

Lucy.  And that she expected from a Lover in his Autumn more Affection
, more Complaisance, more Constancy, and more Discretion of Course.
GARRICK-1759-2,43.783

Heartly.  That is very particular.  GARRICK-1759-2,43.784

Sir Charles.  Ay, but it is very prudent for all that.
GARRICK-1759-2,43.785

Lucy.  In short, as she had openly declared against the Nephew, I took
upon me to speak of his Uncle.  GARRICK-1759-2,43.786

Sir Charles.  Of me, Child?  GARRICK-1759-2,43.787

<P_44>

Lucy.  Yes, of you, Sir; GARRICK-1759-2,44.789

- And she did not say me Nay, GARRICK-1759-2,44.790

- But cast such a Look, and fetch'd such a Sigh, - That if ever I look'd
and sigh'd in my Life, I know how it is with her.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.791

Sir Charles.  What the Devil!  GARRICK-1759-2,44.792

- Why surely, - Eh, <font> Lucy!  <$$font> You joke for certain,
GARRICK-1759-2,44.793

- Mr. <font> Heartly!  <$$font> - Eh!  GARRICK-1759-2,44.794

- Lucy Indeed I do not, Sir, GARRICK-1759-2,44.795

- $'T $was {TEXT:'Twas} in vain for me to say that nothing cou'd be so
ridiculous as such a Choice.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.796

- Nay, Sir, I went a little further, <paren> $You $'ll {TEXT:You'll}
excuse me <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,44.797

and told her - Good God Madam, said I, why he is Old and Gouty, Astmatic,
Rheumatic, Sciatic, Spleen-atic.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.798

- It signified nothing, GARRICK-1759-2,44.799

she had determined.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.800

- Sir Charles.  But you need not have told her all that.
GARRICK-1759-2,44.801

Heartly.  I am persuaded, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, that a good Heart,
and a good Mind will prevail more with that young Lady, than the more
fashionable Accomplishments.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.802

Sir Charles.  $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you what, Neighbour,
GARRICK-1759-2,44.803

I have had my Days, GARRICK-1759-2,44.804

GARRICK-1759-2,44.805

But in Truth, I am rather in my Winter than my Autumn;
GARRICK-1759-2,44.806

she must mean somebody else.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.807

Now I think again - GARRICK-1759-2,44.808

It $can $n't {TEXT:can't} be me - GARRICK-1759-2,44.809

No, no, it $can $n't {TEXT:can't} be me.  GARRICK-1759-2,44.810

- You are the Man, - GARRICK-1759-2,44.812

<P_45>

Her Stars have decreed it; GARRICK-1759-2,45.814

and what they decree, tho'ever so ridiculous, must come to pass.
GARRICK-1759-2,45.815

- Sir Charles.  Say you so?  GARRICK-1759-2,45.816

- Why then, Monsieur Nephew, I shall have a little Laugh with you, -
Ha, ha, ha!  GARRICK-1759-2,45.817

The Tit-bit is not for you, my nice Sir.  GARRICK-1759-2,45.818

- But here he comes - GARRICK-1759-2,45.820

Not a Word for your Life.  GARRICK-1759-2,45.821

Miss Harriet.  Bless me, Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font>, what is
all this Music for in the next Room?  GARRICK-1759-2,49.883

Y. Clackit.  I brought the Gentlemen of the String, Mademoiselle
, to convince you, that I feel, as I ought, the Honour you have
done me - <font> <paren> Shewing the Letter.  <$$paren> <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,49.884

But for Heaven's sake be sincere a little with these good Folks;
GARRICK-1759-2,49.885

they tell me here that I am Nobody, and there is another happier than
myself, GARRICK-1759-2,49.886

and for the Soul of me, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know how to believe 'em,
- Ha, ha, ha!  GARRICK-1759-2,49.887

Sir Charles.  Let us hear Miss speak.  GARRICK-1759-2,49.888

Miss Harriet.  It is a most terrible Task; GARRICK-1759-2,49.889

but I am compel'd to it, GARRICK-1759-2,49.890

and to hesitate any longer wou'd be injurious to my Guardian, his Friend ,
this young Gentleman, and my own Character.  GARRICK-1759-2,49.891

Y. Clackit.  Most judicious, upon my Soul.  GARRICK-1759-2,49.892

Sir Charles.  Hold your Tongue, <font> Jack.  <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,49.893

Y. Clackit.  I am Dumb.  GARRICK-1759-2,49.894

Miss Harriet.  You have all been in an Error.  GARRICK-1759-2,49.895

- My Bashfulness may have deceiv'd you, GARRICK-1759-2,49.896

- My Heart never did.  GARRICK-1759-2,49.897

- <P_50> Y. Clackit.  <font> C'est vrai.  <$$font>
GARRICK-1759-2,50.898

Miss Harriet.  Therefore, before I declare my Sentiments, it is proper
that I disavow any Engagement: GARRICK-1759-2,50.899

- but at the same time must confess - Y. Clackit.  Ho, - ho!  -
Miss Harriet.  With Fear and Shame confess - Y. Clackit.  <font>
Courage, Mademoiselle!  <$$font> Miss Harriet.  That Another , not You,
Sir, has gain'd a Power over my Heart.  - <font> <paren> To <$$font>
Y. Clackit.  <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,50.900

Sir Charles.  <font> Another <$$font>, not <font> you <$$font>;
GARRICK-1759-2,50.901

mind that, <font> Jack.  <$$font> Ha!  ha!  GARRICK-1759-2,50.902

Miss Harriet.  It is a Power indeed which he despises.
GARRICK-1759-2,50.903

- I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be deceived in his Conduct.
GARRICK-1759-2,50.904

- Modesty may tye the Tongue of our Sex, GARRICK-1759-2,50.905

but Silence in him could proceed only from Contempt.
GARRICK-1759-2,50.906

Sir Charles.  How prettily she reproaches me!  GARRICK-1759-2,50.907

- But $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} soon make it up with her.  GARRICK-1759-2,50.908

Miss Harriet.  As to that Letter, Sir; your Error there, is excusable ;
GARRICK-1759-2,50.909

and I own myself in that Particular a little blameable.
GARRICK-1759-2,50.910

- But it was not my Fault that it was sent <P_51> to you;
GARRICK-1759-2,51.911

and the Contents must have told you, that it could not possibly be
meant for you.  <paren> <font> To <$$font> Y. Clackit.  <$$paren>
GARRICK-1759-2,51.912

Sir Charles.  Proof positive, <font> Jack: <$$font> -
GARRICK-1759-2,51.913

Say no more.  GARRICK-1759-2,51.914

- Now is my Time to begin.  GARRICK-1759-2,51.915

- Hem!  - hem!  - Sweet young Lady, - hem!  - whose Charms are so mighty,
so far transcending every thing we read of, in History or Fable ,
how could you possibly think that my Silence proceeded from Contempt?
GARRICK-1759-2,51.916

Was it natural or prudent, think you, for a Man of sixty-five, nay,
just entering into his sixty-sixth year - GARRICK-1759-2,51.917

Y. Clackit.  <font> O Misericorde!  <$$font> What, is my Uncle
my Rival!  GARRICK-1759-2,51.918

Nay then I shall burst, by <font> Jupiter!  <$$font> - Ha!  ha!  ha!
GARRICK-1759-2,51.919

Miss Harriet.  $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} imagine, Sir, that to me your Age
is any Fault.  GARRICK-1759-2,51.920

Sir Charles <paren> <font> Bowing.  <$$font> <$$paren> You are very
obliging, Madam.  GARRICK-1759-2,51.921

Miss Harriet.  Neither is it, Sir, a Merit of that extraordinary Nature,
that I should sacrifice to it an Inclination which I have conceived
for another.  GARRICK-1759-2,51.922

Sir Charles.  How is this?  GARRICK-1759-2,51.923

Y. Clackit.  Another!  not you.  - GARRICK-1759-2,51.924

mind that, Uncle.  GARRICK-1759-2,51.925

Lucy.  What is the Meaning of all this!  GARRICK-1759-2,51.926

<P_52>

Y. Clackit.  Proof positive, Uncle - And very positive.
GARRICK-1759-2,52.928

Sir Charles.  I have been led into a Mistake, Madam, which I hope you
will excuse; GARRICK-1759-2,52.929

and I have made myself very ridiculous, which I hope I shall forget:
GARRICK-1759-2,52.930

- And so, Madam, I am your humble Servant.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.931

- This young Lady has something very extraordinary about her.
GARRICK-1759-2,52.932

Heartly.  What I now see and the Remembrance of what is past force me
to break Silence.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.933

Y. Clackit.  Ay, now for it.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.934

Hear him - GARRICK-1759-2,52.935

hear him.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.936

- Heartly.  O my <font> Harriet!  <$$font> - I too must be disgrac'd in
my Turn.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.937

- Can you think that I have seen and convers'd with you unmov'd?
GARRICK-1759-2,52.938

- Indeed I have not.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.939

- The more I was sensible of your Merit, the stronger were my Motives
to stifle the Ambition of my Heart.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.940

- But now I can no longer resist the Violence of my Passion, which
casts me at your Feet, the most unworthy indeed of all your Admirers,
but of all the most affectionate.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.941

Y. Clackit.  So, so, the Moon has changed, GARRICK-1759-2,52.942

and the grown Gentlemen begin to be frisky.  GARRICK-1759-2,52.943

Lucy.  What, my Master in Love too!  GARRICK-1759-2,52.944

- $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} never trust these Tye Wigs again.  <paren> <font>
Aside.  <$$font> <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,52.945

<P_53>

Miss Harriet.  I have refused my Hand to Sir <font> Charles <$$font>
and this young Gentleman: GARRICK-1759-2,53.947

- The one accuses me of Caprice, the other of Singularity.
GARRICK-1759-2,53.948

- Should I refuse my Hand a third Time, <paren> <font> smiling
<$$font> <$$paren> I might draw upon myself a more severe Reproach,
GARRICK-1759-2,53.949

- and therefore I accept your Favour, Sir, GARRICK-1759-2,53.950

and will endeavour to deserve it.  GARRICK-1759-2,53.951

Heartly.  And thus I seal my Acknowledgments, GARRICK-1759-2,53.952

and from henceforth devote my every Thought, and all my Services to the
Author of my Happiness.  GARRICK-1759-2,53.953

<paren> <font> Kisses her hand.  <$$font> <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,53.954

Lucy.  Since Matters are so well settled, give me leave, Sir, to
congratulate you on your Success, - and my young Lady on her Judgment.
GARRICK-1759-2,53.955

- You have my Taste exactly, Miss; GARRICK-1759-2,53.956

ripe Fruit for my Money; GARRICK-1759-2,53.957

when it is too green it sets one's Teeth on edge, GARRICK-1759-2,53.958

and when too mellow it has no Flavour at all.  GARRICK-1759-2,53.959

Sir Charles.  Hold your Tongue, you Baggage, <paren> <font> to <$$font>
Lucy.  <$$paren> GARRICK-1759-2,53.960

Well, my dear discreet Nephew, are you satisfied with the Fool's Part you
have given me, and play'd yourself, in the Farce?  GARRICK-1759-2,53.961

Y. Clackit.  What would you have me say, Sir?
GARRICK-1759-2,53.962

I am too much a Philosopher to fret myself, because the Wind, which was
East this Morning, is now West.  GARRICK-1759-2,53.963

- The poor Girl in pique has kill'd herself, to be reveng'd on me;
GARRICK-1759-2,53.964

but $hark $ye {TEXT:hark'ye}, Sir, GARRICK-1759-2,53.965

I believe <font> Heartly <$$font> will be cursed mad to have me live in
his Neighbourhood.  GARRICK-1759-2,53.966

- A Word to the Wise.  GARRICK-1759-2,53.967

- <P_54> Sir Charles.  Thou hast a most incorrigible Vanity, <font>
Jack <$$font>, GARRICK-1759-2,54.968

and nothing can cure thee.  GARRICK-1759-2,54.969

- Mr. <font> Heartly <$$font>, I have Sense enough, and Friendship
enough, not to be uneasy at your Happiness.  GARRICK-1759-2,54.970

Heartly.  I hope, Sir <font> Charles <$$font>, that we shall still
continue to live as Neighbours and Friends.  GARRICK-1759-2,54.971

For you, my <font> Harriet <$$font>, Words $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
express my Wonder or my Joy; GARRICK-1759-2,54.972

my future Conduct must tell you what a Sense I have of my Happiness,
and how much I shall endeavour to deserve it.  GARRICK-1759-2,54.973

My friendly Care shall change to grateful Love, and the fond Husband
still the Guardian prove.  GARRICK-1759-2,54.974

Finis.  GARRICK-1759-2,54.975
