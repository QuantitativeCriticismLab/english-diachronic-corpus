28 <font> th January <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.4

My dear Sister - I have been in your debt for a Letter, which came most
acceptably, and which I did not at the time mean to owe you for so long
: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.5

my delay, as I hope you have never doubted, arose from occupation
, from want of news, from anything but want of care about you.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.6

I have an evening to myself just now, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.7

and, as I can hope also for a frank, you shall have the benefit of
such opportunity.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.8

It gave us great satisfaction to hear that you were safe, and had realised
a little Boy, of whom we have learnt since from various quarters to
entertain a hopeful opinion.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.9

Nourish up the little Alick with all diligence; that he grow to be a
man profitable in his day and generation!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.10

Our work in it will be over by and by; and his be beginning.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.11

Mrs. Welsh saw you and him and James, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,254.12

and sent us word <P_2,255> about it; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.13

she subsequently also sent to you for news CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.14

<paren> she told us <$$paren>, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.15

but your own Letter was just coming off.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.16

Or perhaps I am confusing all manner of dates here?
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.17

For the truth is, I have sat so chained to my writing-table these many
weeks; {COM:sic} that much of the outer world often seems to me almost
like a dream.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.18

James, I think, has very likely done well to purchase himself a house.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.19

You will find yourself much more comfortable in a"bit <font>
haddin <$$font> {COM:holding,_house} of your ain for a'that";
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.20

indeed, I imagine the house is of itself far better than your present
one: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.21

besides it tends to give the Goodman a kind of consistency in his Trade
; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.22

and so I hope every way will turn to good.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.23

He has a fair proportion of business, I understand:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.24

"the hand of the diligent"had long ago the best word;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.25

and even in these times shall not be altogether foiled.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.26

I hope all that is favourable of you both; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.27

to hear that you live not as fools but as wise: that is the grand blessing
for this world and for the next.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,255.28

As to myself, having already told you of <P_2,256> sitting over my papers
, and struggling with my evil genius there, I have hardly anything more
to say that is important.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.29

My health stands out very tolerably, though it is the most unwholesome
craft: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.30

it is true, I am faithful in walking and so forth, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.31

and we have generally weather one can walk in.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.32

I do not think I ever saw a year with less than <font> six <$$font>
times as much rain: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.33

this is a far drier climate than yours, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.34

and the present season, moreover, has been unusually dry.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.35

In other respects, all goes as it was wont, or nearly so.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.36

We have a few friends that come about us, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.37

and might very easily have more <font> visitors <$$font> if not friends
; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.38

but find no profit in that: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.39

the good are <font> thin-sawn {COM:thin-sown} <$$font> everywhere,
and perhaps not thicker here than elsewhere, though there are <font>
more <$$font> to choose among.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.40

The quantity of <font> folly <$$font> in all shapes that one finds here
is really amazing.  Gabble-gabble in every kind under the sun except
the <font> wise <$$font> kind: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.41

the reasons are"like two wheat-grains in the bushel of chaff.
"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.42

We must even let it go on, as it has done, and will do;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,256.43

it can, on the whole,"da'tha naither <P_2,257> ill na'guid.
"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.44

At lowest it is my happiness, as it was of that joiner friend of
James's <paren> whose name I think was Thomson <$$paren>, that if
contradiction is like to drive one mad at any time, one can"take gey
guid care; and aye mostly work in <font> a place by himsel'!  <$$font>
"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.45

I, by the nature of the case, mostly aye work in just such a place.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.46

- What the fruit of my working is to be we shall not begin to know
yet for seven or eight months; or perhaps for not as many years:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.47

that is the law of the trade, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.48

and one must just abide by it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.49

I do the best I can, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.50

and shall pray to be thankful for such reward, or such punishment,
as is appointed.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.51

One thing alone I am sure of, that if I live I shall <font> have done
<$$font> with the weary job; - and then hope for another that may be
easier and more profitable.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.52

Probably some of them have told you that the thing was growing on my
hands, and threatened to become three volumes!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.53

I was to be done in February or March; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.54

and so, if I have it all fairly off my hands by the end of May I shall
think it very tolerable.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,257.55

But <font> then <$$font> <P_2,258> indeed, if the guiding Powers continue
kind, Jack will be coming homewards, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.56

and we shall have a <font> gliff <$$font> {COM:glimpse} of Scotland again!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.57

It is by toil, and the vanquishing of trouble and obstruction, that man
lives here below.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.58

I need not tell you about our Elections and public matters;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.59

men have been parading all streets with Election Placards on long poles ,
or with two <font> poleless <$$font> Placards, one on breast and one on
back, fastened with string; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.60

others have been busy singing Ballads, hawking Political squibs,
etc. etc., of the like purport; to all which, I have said:
Behold I have no care for thee!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.61

You too, I find, have had the pleasure of an Election,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.62

and Sharpe has got once more returned, though with difficulty.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.63

It seems to me there are confused times coming; times that $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be furthersome to peaceable men.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.64

For these also, however, one must be ready.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.65

Meanwhile, they that are called to mingle in such work are not the
enviablest; but rather they that can say to it, Go thou thy way, I
go mine.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,258.66

<P_2,259>

Allan Cunningham has been unwell, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.68

and I have not seen him for a great while, though often purposing to
do it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.69

He lost a brother here in Autumn, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.70

and seemed to suffer from it: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.71

his wife also has lost a brother resident here.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.72

They are <font> canny <$$font> people; of whom one gets, with some good,
no chance of hurt.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.73

"There is a Dumfries Mason,"Jane said, the first time she saw him;"
better such, very considerably, than many a Cockney Literary Gentleman!
"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.74

My Mother has written me a Letter since yours, with nothing but good
news in it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.75

I fear always she leans to the <font> favourable side.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.76

Your accounts of her way of doing, the look of her rooms, etc.,
are very interesting to me, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.77

and form the best of what picture I have made out respecting it.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.78

She says, last time, you had sent her a cake for New-year's gift.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.79

That was right.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.80

O be good to her: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.81

I need not bid you, I do believe.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.82

She has been a blessing to us; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.83

and, I trust in God, will long continue so.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.84

When I look over the world, and see what Mothers and Fathers the average
have, I feel thankful for mine.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,259.85

She said they had been singing <P_2,260> at Scotsbrig;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.86

"Johnnie o'Cox"was sung too: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.87

I am right glad to hear of a song there.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.88

But now, <font> Missus <$$font>, I have a commission for you about that.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.89

Will you go over to any Stationer's shop, and buy half a quire <paren>
12 sheets <$$paren> of <font> ruled <$$font> Paper CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.90

<paren> they have it ruled with blue ink, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.91

or can soon rule it <$$paren>; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.92

or if one has it not, go to another, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.93

and on the whole <font> get <$$font> it; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.94

and send it to my Mother for writing to me on.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.95

She wants nothing but straight lines to write a most sufficient slow
hand; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.96

and unless you bestir yourself in that way, I see no chance of her
securing it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.97

Now will you look to that?  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.98

See in packing it, that you wrap it well, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.99

and if possible lay it <font> flat <$$font> <paren> in some Book
if there be such a thing; or between two pasteboards <$$paren>;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.100

for otherwise it gets creased, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.101

and"becomes unpleasant. "CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.102

I must write some more letters than this; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.103

and will not seal till to-morrow: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.104

you shall then have"time of day"again, - unless I am too hurried.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,260.105

We are going to dine with the Bullers, who have all taken up their
abode in Town, and are very kindly disposed towards <P_2,261> us.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.106

It is there that I expect a frank; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.107

for there will likely be a Radical Member or two present.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.108

Charles is becoming a notable in that department; a <font> liesh <$$font>
{COM:brisk_effectual} fellow, were he not so loose in the hinges!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.109

- Jane is sitting sewing here; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.110

she sends you both her kind New-year's wishes.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.111

Be happy in your quiet circle there; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.112

be faithful, diligent, undaunted.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.113

Love one another; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.114

bear one another's burdens: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.115

how much is there in that!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.116

Alas, we have all our faults, our infirmities, our blindnesses,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.117

and have much to forgive and be forgiven.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.118

God bless you, dear <font> Craw!  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.119

- Your affectionate Brother, T. Carlyle.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,261.120

5 Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.123

28 <font> th January <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.124

My dear Alick - It is long since I got you written to with any
deliberation; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.125

I know not how long.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.126

I have been so busy; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.127

nothing but flying slips of paper, and blotting and scribbling all round
me for week after week.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.128

However, now for the last eight days, I have been making a sort of pause ;
occupied only with reading and reflecting: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.129

so before $falling $to {TEXT:falling-to} again, I will send you a
small word.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.130

You may well fancy, judging no doubt by yourself, that I am often, often
thinking of you while no writing goes between us: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.131

indeed whither should my mind turn, when it has leisure to meditate,
if <font> not <$$font> towards Annandale, where so much of my possession
in this lower world lies? ...  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.132

My Mother's last letter came the very day I had sent off a hasty scrap
to her.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,262.133

The various postscripts and notices contained in that welcome sheet gave
me a clear notion of <P_2,263> Scotsbrig, with the winter work you were
all busy in: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.134

I was particularly glad to hear you had been down shortly before, and
that"singing"had been going on among you.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.135

Long be the like among us!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.136

You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} imagine how quiet and cheery all that
looks from amid the confused din of this Metropolitan Monstrosity!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.137

Here, least of all places on Earth's surface, quiet never is;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.138

a raging and a roaring; all men hunted or hunting; all things"
made like unto a <font> wheel <$$font>"- that turns and turns.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.139

I have grown greatly used to it now; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.140

and for most part walk the London streets as if they were peopled
only with Images, and the noise were that of some Niagara Waterfall,
or distracted universal carding-mill.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.141

There is something animating in it too; so that in my walks I generally
turn Townwards, and go up through a larger or shorter circuit of real
London Tumult CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.142

<paren> hereabouts we are not much noisier than in the stiller parts of
Edinburgh, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.143

and in <font> our street <$$font> at ten at night and later there is no
noise at all <$$paren>: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.144

for"man likes to see the face of man;"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,263.145

one's very dispiritment in these peopled spaces is <P_2,264> nothing to
the gloom of Puttock.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.146

My shortest turn <paren> for I have various of various lengths <$$paren>
is to Hyde Park Corner; where I see quality carriages, six-horse
waggons <paren> horses all jingling with little bells <$$paren>,
mail coaches, etc. etc.; and the Duke of $Wellington $'s
{TEXT:Wellington's} House, the windows all barred with iron <paren> since
the Reform Bill time <$$paren>, and huge iron railing twenty feet high
between him and the street, which, as the railing is lined with wood too,
he does not seem to <font> like: <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.147

there are carriages sometimes about his gate now; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.148

and I bless myself that I am not he.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.149

Let me mention also that a waggoner occasionally passes this door
<paren> of Cheyne Row <$$paren>, whose voice to his horses,"wey-ho! "
infallibly brings me in mind of one I have heard 300 miles off and more.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.150

- Alas, <font> this <$$font> will never do; the sheet almost done!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.151

Has the Catlinns business got itself settled yet?
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.152

I was very glad to learn that there was some prospect of its soon being
settled; and, on the whole, not sorry that you expected they might make
it eligible for you to stay there.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.153

Staying is always best, if one can stay; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,264.154

there <P_2,265> is such waste every way in removing; waste of time,
of money, of habit and connections: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.155

"three flittings are equal to a fire. "CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.156

But anyway you seem to take it in the right mood: that of courage and
patient faith.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.157

There is no fear in that case.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.158

The world is wide, as you say; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.159

and there is a Heaven above us go where we will.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.160

- Make my respects to little Tom; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.161

and have him speaking a mouthful of Annandale Scotch when I come back:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.162

Jane I fancy is a strapping <font> hizzy <$$font> by this time, and able
to bear her share in any dialogue.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.163

Be careful of them, poor Creatures; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.164

and above and before all things, study to train them in the way that
they should go.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.165

My own history here may be summed up in very few words.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.166

I have finished my"First Part,"which may possibly make a First Volume;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.167

and am about beginning the Second and then the Third.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.168

On the whole, I am about <font> half <$$font> done;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.169

for a great deal of the stuff is laid in.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.170

I shall have a tough struggle however; all the way till the summer
be come.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,265.171

Other work or thought I do not much occupy <P_2,266> myself with:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.172

this is the day's task CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.173

and is sufficient for the day.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.174

The hopes I have of it are not very high; though I piously believe with
old Johnson that"useful diligence will at last prevail;"and calculate
that several other shifts may open before then.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.175

...  By God's blessing I calculate that the Spirit of Dishonesty <font>
shall not <$$font> get dominion over me; nor the Spirit of Despondency ,
nor any other evil spirit; in which case all will and must be <font> well.
<$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.176

There are many people kind to me, and many that seem to think far more
of me than I merit; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.177

but it is not in them I trust.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.178

On the whole, I do often feel as if all that hindered one were in reality
a blessed furtherance towards something better.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.179

Let a man toil diligently; cast his bread upon the waters, he shall find
it after many days.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.180

- But, alas, my dear Boy, the sheet is done.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.181

I will hope for another chance soon; and in the meantime pray you to
bear in mind that <font> you <$$font> are now clearly my debtor, and that
before the ploughing get too hot, you are actually bound to write to me.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,266.182

Send <font> all <$$font> manner of news, about yourself and
household, <P_2,267> about my Mother, about every one dear to me.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.183

My Mother said you had got her a"cask of good ale. "
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.184

It was right well done: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.185

I thank you as if you had given myself a puncheon.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.186

I hope you go and see her often; and will get her in motion again now
when the days are lengthening.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.187

This spring weather brings me in mind of many things.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.188

Jane is gone to bed; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.189

or she would <font> expressly <$$font> send her love.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.190

She had a baddish time of it with that foot CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.191

but is better now.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.192

- We have not seen Leigh Hunt for almost three months!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.193

There was no quarrel either: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.194

but I believe the poor man is very miserable, and feels shocked
at my rigorous Presbyterian principles; in short is afraid of me!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.195

I pity him much; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.196

but think too, he is perhaps as well where he <font> is <$$font>, and
I where I am.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.197

Good-night, my dear Alick!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.198

Love to Jenny and the Bairns.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,267.199

- Ever your affectionate Brother, T. Carlyle.

Chelsea, London, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.203

29 <font> th January <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.204

My dear Mother -...  I have told Jean to get you twelve <font> ruled
<$$font> sheets of Paper at Dumfries, and send them out for my benefit :
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.205

it appears to me, you need nothing but straight courses laid out for
you to write as well as need be; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.206

you will be slower than some of us; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.207

but you can begin in time always, and fill your sheet independently of
any of them.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.208

I have strictly charged Jean to look to the paper;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.209

so now it will depend on yourself.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.210

- The Letter you sent was very gratifying and cheerful:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.211

I could fancy you all there, assembled in peace and goodwill, and
see all the marketing, beef-salting and other winter work going on.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.212

...  My own work here gets forward as well as it can.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.213

I am very anxious to be perfectly accurate <paren> which I find
to have been exceedingly neglected by my forerunners <$$paren>;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.214

the consequence of that is great searching and trouble;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.215

yet the thing when one is doing it ought to <font> be done.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,268.216

Hollow work always shows its hollowness one <P_2,269> day or other:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.217

all men in all places at all times ought to <font> decline <$$font>
working hollow.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.218

As to the reception I shall meet with, there is no calculating,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.219

nor indeed does it give me almost any anxiety whatever.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.220

The people that judge of Books and Men in these days are a wretched
people, without wisdom, nay, without sincerity, which is the first chance
for having wisdom; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.221

one is under the necessity of letting them babble out their
foolish say, and heeding it no more than the cawing of rooks, -
in whose sound, guidance is <font> not <$$font> for man or woman.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.222

If I write anything that has meaning $in it such meaning <font> $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} <$$font> be lost, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.223

He that <font> gave <$$font> me the meaning will care fitly for it.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.224

I wish, however, I were done with it!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.225

But I must stand to my tools first; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.226

there is no other way.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.227

The trees will be all leafy, and the fields all <font> gowany <$$font>
before I even see the end afar off; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.228

nevertheless through it I will be, if life and strength are left me.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.229

For the rest, dear Mother, be not concerned about my health suffering :
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.230

I find it from day to day the <font> thriftiest <$$font> way not to
overwork myself; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.231

and really my health stands wonderfully well.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,269.232

You see I am at this very <P_2,270> time giving myself a half-recreation
of ten days.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.233

By the time you read this, I hope to be in full activity again.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.234

The Bullers are come to live in London; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.235

Mrs. Buller thinks Charles's health will fare better, were she
here to look after it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.236

She is almost fearfully bound up in Charles; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.237

and I think if he were to die, would almost die too:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.238

it is not safe to lean so on aught earthly.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.239

Charlie, however, is really a good fellow, and rising in his sphere of
life; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.240

yet one $can $not {TEXT:cannot} well prophesy much of him,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.241

he is so flighty, not in his purposes, but in his fits of application.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.242

He and his mother and the whole of them are Radically given, to a very
decided degree.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.243

That also is my humour, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.244

but I find little profit in speaking it out; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.245

<font> rebellion <$$font>, against authority of any kind, is always a
barren matter, full of irritancy, of poor painful feelings which are
more of the Devil than of God.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.246

We are to dine with the Bullers to-night.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.247

I have not been in the Town these three days, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.248

but took my exercise in delving the garden, of which I have got a quarter
put in order again.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,270.249

You will judge what a <P_2,271> dry soil we have by my delving at
this season.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.250

It is indeed CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.251

and has been the finest winter I can remember. ...
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.252

{ED:CXXXVIII._To_his_Mother,_Scotsbrig}

Chelsea, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.254

17 <font> th February <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.255

My dear Mother - I am afraid I do not keep my promise and purpose to
you so well as I ought in the writing way; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.256

it is the weakness of the ability not of the will.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.257

I sit here of late so very motionless over my task-sheet, that the world
is almost foreign to me: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.258

I take no note of its ways; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.259

the flight of days and of weeks goes on unmarked, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.260

and I am astonished to find them departed.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.261

You get the Newspaper, happily still with its <font> two strokes; <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.262

and will not be uneasy about me.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.263

Besides I think you know so much of my old punctuality as to be pretty
sure that if anything really bad were happening, I would not keep you
in ignorance.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.264

As to the <font> fash <$$font> of putting the Newspaper into the
Post-office, that is literally nothing; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.265

I go out to walk daily, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.266

and nearly always from choice go up towards the press of the Town
<paren> close <font> past <$$font> the Post-office <$$paren>;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,271.267

<P_2,272>

the tumult of these, my brethren, sons of Adam, amuses me.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.269

How different from the lone musing stroll along the Glaisters Hill-side!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.270

I never think of that now without a kind of shudder at it; of thankfulness
that I am away from it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.271

- But indeed I ought to write to you more deliberately, and will <paren>
were this villainous Book once done <$$paren>: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.272

nay, there is hope that I shall see you again before very long, which
will be far better!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.273

Jack's letter when it came in reminded me that I had heard nothing from
Annandale since the last time of writing to him; also that I had not
written to you again as I meant.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.274

- He is well, the worthy Doctor, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.275

and talks of home-coming!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.276

That late illness of Lady Clare's seems to have been a trying kind of
predicament for him; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.277

and I think he managed with great honesty and discretion; really very
<font> well.  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.278

The"Homoeopathic Medicine"he talks of is a thing the poor <font> Gomerals
<$$font> are making a noise about here too: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.279

it is probably among the most perfect delusions of its day, as far as
I can see into it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.280

Neither for love nor for money let a man have <font> any <$$font> thing to
do with delusions in any place or at any time!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,272.281

<P_2,273>

Jack, I trust, will come back to us <font> grown <$$font> in many
respects; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.283

I hope we shall all meet again, for the better and not for the worse.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.284

As to my own proceedings here, they amount to almost nothing,
except the slow but determined progress my poor Book is making.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.285

I <font> $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <$$font> write it fast;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.286

I could write it fast enough, if I would write it ill:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.287

but that I have determined not to do - wilfully.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.288

It will be bad enough <font> against <$$font> one's will.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.289

O that I were done with it!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.290

But Patience!  Patience!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.291

One must <font> go <$$font> on, - as we did at the Cressfield shearing :
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.292

were it but a sheaf cut, it will not"<font> loup in again.  <$$font>
"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.293

Hurry after all is of no use; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.294

one does nothing of any weight by <font> hurrying.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.295

Many a time I think of my good Father's method of working, how he went
on"without haste, without rest;"and did in that way the very most, I
must believe, that he <font> could <$$font> do.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.296

I am not so wise in my trade; which, indeed, is more difficult to
manage wisely.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.297

However, you are not to suppose that I work myself into ill health.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,273.298

No; I really am not under my usual condition in that particular; <P_2,274>
rather above, I should say; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.299

for I take <font> no <$$font> drugs now; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.300

and, for example, yesterday I walked upwards of eight miles <paren>
to and from the Bullers'old house; they are in a new one now, a mile
and half nearer us <$$paren> before dinner, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.301

and was not a whit exhausted.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.302

I am still in a <font> new <$$font> sort of health, not as I used to be;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.303

nay I sometimes think, I shall get heartily healthy once more, and be
a young brisk man - turned of forty!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.304

In my mind, I feel quite young yet; and <font> growing <$$font>, as when
I was eighteen: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.305

this is the greatest blessing.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.306

As to my outlooks here, and indeed as to the world and the ways of
it, and <font> its <$$font> usage of me better or worse, I $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} say that my heart is distressed, or will distress itself
about it: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.307

it is God's world, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.308

and I am God's worker in it; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.309

well for me if I can <font> be <$$font> that!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.310

I seem to see better and better that I have not wholly mistaken my
calling, in that point of view; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.311

and as to the rest - <font> Good <$$font> is our Maker;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.312

He will give us strength according to our burden.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.313

- Hitherto the look of Literature as a trade is full of the wretchedest
contradictions; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,274.314

nor do I see how any man that has more than meat to look for, <P_2,275>
and would <font> keep <$$font>, not a carriage, but a conscience, can
do much good in it as a getter of money.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.315

I have not found it very blessed in the way of <font> ease <$$font>
either as I worked at it: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.316

on the whole, if it do not show a fairer side, I will fling it from me,
and seek bread <font> otherwise: <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.317

there is bread to be had elsewhere; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.318

and I will think my thought, and write it down <paren> as the Heavens
enable me <$$paren>, and ask only Heaven's permission to do that.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.319

Accordingly, I question if there is any man in London with as
small a"fixed capital,"who carries his head as free, and will
take fewer <font> dunts <$$font> from man or thing than"one Carlyle
{TEXT:y_italicized_in_text} of Craigenputtock,"worthy man, - one of whose
<font> toes <$$font> is sore at this moment; which is his grand grievance.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.320

The truth is, dear Mother, I am <font> full <$$font> of my task, and see
it getting on; and think that is more than perhaps His Majesty can say:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.321

for me it ought to be enough.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.322

The Book will probably bring me no money; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.323

but I can do without that; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.324

and were it done and my hands free, I can write an"Article"or two again.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,275.325

They say it is going to be a tolerable <P_2,276> enough Book; a queer
Book, yes, a <font> very <$$font> queer Book.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.326

- Jane's foot is quite whole, and her health, I think, as good as it
has been for long.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.327

We go on very quietly here: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.328

"indulge"in a cup of hot coffee at eight o'clock by way of breakfast :
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.329

she then goes downstairs, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.330

and leaves me the room to scribble in till one or two;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.331

then I walk or dig till four: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.332

dinner next of simple mutton chop and <font>'tatie; <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.333

a little music, reading, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.334

or by a time some solid friendly visitor CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.335

<paren> no <font> quack <$$font> is at the pains to come so far <$$paren>
, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.336

and so at ten our porridge comes in, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.337

and"all is by"in a very innocent manner.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.338

...  Now, when is the ruled sheet to come?  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.339

I long to know all about you, how you are, what you are doing.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.340

...  O what a blessing that you are still able to go on so well.  That you
have a reasonable, acquiescing, hoping spirit!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.341

I thank you, dear Mother, a thousand times for the lessons you and my
Father taught me; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.342

they are more precious than fine gold.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.343

...  Jane's love to you all.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.344

Good - night, dear Mother.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.345

- Ever your affectionate, T. Carlyle.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,276.346

<P_2,277>

The <font> Examiner <$$font> comes irregularly to poor Hunt; sometimes
<paren> as last week <$$paren> not at all: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.348

<font> that <$$font> is the reason, and not my neglect.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.349

Almost always you will get something on Sabbath; and sometimes on another
day too.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.350

They can ask when they are at the village.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.351

All are talking politics here; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.352

not I: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.353

it is <font> nothing <$$font> to me.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.354

{ED:CXXXIX._To_Alexander_Carlyle,_Catlinns,_Lockerbie}

Chelsea, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.356

27 <font> th February <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.357

...  The Proverb says,'Better a finger off than ay'wagging.
'CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.358

I will not regret that you are done with that <font> glarry <$$font>
{COM:miry,_muddy} business of Catlinns; that now all the world is all
before you where to choose.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.359

There is a probability that farm-stock will not be much <font> lower
<$$font>, at any rate, about Whitsunday; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.360

so your calculation, favourable for the present, may be found to hold
good then: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.361

and thus with"private capital"rather increased, with health , and a
free heart and conscience, you can <font> take the bent <$$font>
{COM:take_the_open_field,_set_out_on_new_adventures} again.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,277.362

I wish I knew <P_2,278> what were really wisest for you.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.363

For a <font> wisest <$$font> thing there indubitably is;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.364

only we with our poor eyes $can $not {TEXT:cannot} always discern it.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.365

I, in particular, so far off, so inexperienced in the whole matter , can
give you no counsel that has more to recommend it than best intention.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.366

You do well to ask counsel of the Heavens, and man's Great Guide there.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.367

New enterprises are always best entered on in that solemn feeling of
dependence: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.368

in various senses that I can see, it is truly written,"He that seeketh
<font> findeth.  <$$font>"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.369

- On the whole, however, you are not to take gloomy views,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.370

for there is nothing to mourn at, to despair at: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.371

a serious cheerfulness; that is the right mood in this as in all cases.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.372

It is my impression that you ought not to meddle again with farms, at
least not this year, when the season is spent, and so much is discouraging
in that direction.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.373

In fact, I rather still incline to conjecture that Farming is henceforth
no good trade in Scotland or Britain; not a better trade than others;
a worse than several.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,278.374

We have often talked over that matter: high <P_2,279> rents, low prices
; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.375

a hungry set of Landlords <paren> for I believe they too are sunk in
debt <$$paren>, a population which, whatever Newspaper"Prosperities
of trade"and so forth may say, is <paren> and ever must be <$$paren>
struggling deeper and deeper into destitution, and inability to purchase
anything but Potatoes; - these, with the enormous competition, are fatal
circumstances for farming.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.376

Farming in America were something, - on your own land!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.377

For the sky is bounteous there as here, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.378

and the sky's bounty is not there whisked away, as by art magic, into
hands that have not toiled for it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.379

At the worst I always look to America.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.380

Perhaps, as to Scottish farming, it is well that you are rid of that.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.381

Nothing else suggests itself to me as so likely for you as going down
to Annan.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.382

There is always, and must always be, a good deal of trading in grain and
farm-produce; in the management of which, a man that <font> can <$$font>
manage it with discretion, punctuality, energy, must find some sort
of reward.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.383

What degree of reward it is at present, I know not at all,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.384

but you do CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.385

or can learn; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,279.386

and as for your fitness to work in that way, I have <P_2,280> always
understood it to be very considerable, and that, if you would improve
more and more in <font> Punctuality <$$font> <paren> which is the
soul of all commerce <$$paren> it might decidedly become superior,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.387

and I know not how much so.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.388

But the danger all over Annandale <paren> perhaps less in Annan than
elsewhere <$$paren> is that miserable habit of <font> maffling <$$font>
{COM:trifling}, in all senses of the word: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.389

you must guard sternly and continually against that.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.390

I have also noticed that you are too sanguine or vehement <paren> which
is also a fault of my own <$$paren>, and take in more work than you can
accomplish: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.391

this is a great enemy to Punctuality <paren> one so often fails, and
gets into the habit of failing <$$paren>, an"enemy to verta {COM:virtue}
"in general.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.392

Lastly the whole breed of us have"a dibble of a temper. "
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.393

These, my dear Brother, are the things to be striven with, to be better
and better subdued: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.394

it is really my opinion that you were then <font> well qualified <$$font>
for that kind of industry, and might find yourself more at home thereby
in Annan than anywhere you have yet been.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,280.395

There are really some trustworthy and regular-working substantial
characters <P_2,281> there; with whom by degrees you would
get into the proper footing, and find it profitable every way.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.396

I think they are the best people I know about in our county.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.397

The loose, the vague, the irregular that have no rule or plan of
conducting themselves <paren> of whom also there are plenty <$$paren>
, you will naturally shun: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.398

there may be profit away from such; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.399

<font> with <$$font> such it is not possible that profit can be.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.400

- Think therefore what you might earn by trading in <paren> say <$$paren>
corn and meal, no farther than you already see and understand such trade.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.401

If it would suffice to support you, I think you might go with no
hesitation, with alacrity.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.402

A house and park <paren> cow's grass, at any rate <$$paren> $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} cost very much; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.403

and with no servant, and a wife faithfully disposed to do the best, and
who will learn better and better to do it, you can be far more comfortable
than heretofore <paren> with such a set of <font> gillenyers <$$font>
{COM:great,_lazy_gluttons} <$$paren>; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.404

you may live there in a still but assiduously industrious way, putting
your hand no farther than the sleeve will let: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,281.405

I think there <P_2,282> is a fair prospect, that <font> fitness <$$font>
for your employment would really bring recompense in it; better and
better recompense as you grew fitter.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.406

- You see I have it all cut and dry for you, as if I knew it all.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.407

But you will not forget that I properly know nothing of it, as it
practically, at the moment <font> is: <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.408

you will correct my theory when you find it and the reality part company.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.409

...  I may say truly, Clow of $Land $'s {TEXT:Land's} liking to <font>
Teufelsdro`ckh <$$font> is a real satisfaction to me; among the more
genuine I have had from that Book.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.410

That it comes home to an earnest mind, so far away from it in every sense
, is proof that there is earnest stuff in it; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.411

and should and does please me much more than any flimsy Review-praise
it could have got from any Critic now going.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.412

I unluckily have not one other copy, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.413

or the worthy neighbour should have it: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.414

perhaps it may be reprinted as a Book one day, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.415

and then <paren> if it be in our time <$$paren> we may have another
chance.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,282.416

I feel pretty much inclined to believe that had it been published in
that fashion at <P_2,283> first, it might actually have <font> done.
<$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.417

Several persons do more than like it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.418

My last Copy was solicited from me <paren> through the Bullers
<$$paren> very lately by a Sir W. Molesworth, a young Squire,
of Radical-Utilitarian temper, but solid English material; much to my
surprise; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.419

for of <font> his <$$font> whole Philosophy <font> it <$$font> is
subversive.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.420

He is the man who has given, to Mill's charge, +L2000 <paren> for he
is rich enough <$$paren> to set a going that <font> Review <$$font>
of theirs.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.421

The first number of it is coming out soon.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.422

As for the <font> French Revolution <$$font>, the worst fault of it is,
it gets on so dreadfully <font> slowly.  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.423

I think otherwise it is better than anything I have done;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.424

for it rests upon a <font> truth <$$font>, upon truths;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.425

and if I had done <font> my best <$$font> with it, I will very cheerfully
tumble it forth to let the world do <font> its <$$font> best or its worst:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.426

Fraser has it advertised as"getting ready"in his next <font> Magazine
<$$font> number.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.427

The party we had at the Taylors'was most brisk, and the cleverest <paren>
best gifted <$$paren> I have been at for years: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,283.428

Mill, Charles Buller <paren> one of the gayest, lightly-sparkling,
lovable souls in the world <$$paren>, <font> Repository <$$font> Fox
<paren> who <font> hotches <$$font> {COM:fidgets} and laughs <P_2,284>
at least <$$paren>, Fonblanque, the <font> Examiner <$$font> Editor, -
were the main men.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.429

It does one good; though I buy it dear, dining so late: towards eight
o'clock!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.430

- I have also seen Southey the Poet <paren> at another Taylor's, where
is one of the finest old women ever discovered: a Miss Fenwick from
Northumberland <$$paren>: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.431

Southey is lean as a harrow; <font> dun <$$font> as a tobacco-spluchan
{COM:spluchan,_meaning_pouch,_in_italics}; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.432

<font> no <$$font> chin <paren> I mean the smallest <$$paren>, <font>
snubbed <$$font> Roman nose, vehement brown eyes, huge <font> white
<$$font> head of hair; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.433

when he rises, all legs together.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.434

We had considerable talk together: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.435

he is a man positive in his own Tory Church of England way; well informed
, rational; a good man: but perhaps so striking for nothing as for his
excitability and irritability, which I should judge to be pre-eminent
even among Poets.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.436

We parted kindly; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.437

and might be ready to meet again.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.438

He lives at Keswick <paren> in Cumberland there <$$paren>;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.439

thinks the world is sinking to ruin, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.440

and writes diligently.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.441

There are few sensible mortals anywhere: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,284.442

I suppose the best stock of them might be looked for <P_2,285> here.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.443

We do not see many people; yet enough for our purposes;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.444

and could see more.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.445

The Bullers are very agreeable; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.446

<font> old <$$font> Charles was down yesterday, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.447

and played a game at chess with Jane: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.448

I like him ever the better were he not so <font> deaf.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.449

But, on the whole, there is nothing I find more profitable than to be left
alone with my <font> French Revolution.  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.450

"They can da'tha naither ill na'guid! "CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.451

You can fancy me sitting there in the old scribbling way, as you have seen
me at Puttock; except that the <font> outrake <$$font> {COM:airing,_walk}
is so inexpressibly different and cheerfuller here: into the very throng
of the sons of Adam and the business they have.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.452

The <font> noise <$$font> long since has become indifferent to me:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.453

<font> here <$$font> at any rate we have no noise;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.454

but at night are as still as you.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.455

...  Good night, my dear Brother!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.456

may God guide you and bless you!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.457

My love to little mute Tom, to talking Jane, and to the Mother
who lovingly watches them, - and shall make tea for me yet.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.458

- I remain, ever your affectionate Brother, T. Carlyle.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,285.459

<P_2,286>

{ED:CXL._To_Dr._Carlyle,_Rome}

Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.462

23 <font> d March <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.463

My dear Brother - Your Letter came in this morning <paren> after sixteen
days from Rome <$$paren>; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.464

and, to-morrow being post-day, I have shoved my writing-table into the
corner, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.465

and sit <paren> with my back to the fire and Jane, who is busy sewing
at my old jupe of a Dressing-gown <$$paren>, forthwith making answer.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.466

It was somewhat longed for; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.467

yet I felt, in other respects, that it was better you had not written
sooner; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.468

for I had a thing to dilate upon, of a most ravelled character, that
was better to be knit up a little first.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.469

You shall hear.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.470

But do not be alarmed; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.471

for it is"neither death nor men's lives": CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.472

we are all well, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.473

and I heard out of Annandale within these three weeks,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.474

nay, Jane's Newspaper came with the customary"two strokes,"only five
days ago.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.475

I meant to write to our Mother last night; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.476

but shall now do it to-morrow.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,286.477

<P_2,287>

Mill had borrowed that first Volume of my poor <font> French Revolution
<$$font> <paren> pieces of it more than <font> once <$$font> <$$paren>
that he might have it all before him, and write down some observations
on it, which perhaps I might print as Notes.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.479

I was busy meanwhile with Volume Second; toiling along like
a <font> Nigger <$$font>, but with the heart of a free Roman:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.480

indeed, I know not how it was, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.481

I had not felt so clear and independent, sure of myself and of my task
for many long years.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.482

Well, one night about three weeks ago, we sat at tea,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.483

and Mill's short rap was heard at the door: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.484

Jane rose to welcome him; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.485

but he stood there unresponsive, pale, the very picture of despair;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.486

said, half-articulately gasping, that she must go down and speak to
"Mrs. Taylor. "CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.487

...  After some considerable additional gasping, I learned from Mill
this fact: that my poor Manuscript, all except some four tattered leaves,
was <font> annihilated!  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.488

He had left it out <paren> too carelessly <$$paren>;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.489

it had been taken for waste-paper: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.490

and so five months of as tough labour as I could remember of, were as
good as vanished, gone like a whiff of smoke.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,287.491

- There never in my life had come <P_2,288> upon me any other <font>
accident <$$font> of much moment; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.492

but this I could not but feel to be a sore one.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.493

The thing was <font> lost <$$font>, and perhaps worse;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.494

for I had not only forgotten all the structure of it,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.495

but the spirit it was written with was past; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.496

only the general impression seemed to remain, and the recollection that
I was on the whole well satisfied with that, and could now hardly hope
to equal it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.497

Mill whom I had to comfort and speak peace to remained injudiciously
enough till almost midnight, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.498

and my poor Dame and I had to sit talking of indifferent matters;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.499

and could not till then get our lament freely uttered.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.500

<font> She <$$font> was very good to me; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.501

and the thing did not beat us.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.502

I felt in general that I was as a little Schoolboy, who had laboriously
written out his <font> Copy <$$font> as he could, and was showing it
not without satisfaction to the Master: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.503

but lo!  the Master had suddenly torn it, saying:"No, boy, thou must go
and write it <font> better.  <$$font>"CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.504

What could I do but sorrowing go and try to obey.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,288.505

That night was a hard one; something from time to time tying me tight as
it were all round the region of the heart, and strange dreams haunting
<P_2,289> me: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.506

however, I was not without good thoughts too that came like healing life
into me; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.507

and I got it somewhat reasonably crushed down, not abolished, yet
subjected to me with the resolution and prophecy of abolishing.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.508

Next morning accordingly I wrote to Fraser <paren> who had <font>
advertised <$$font> the Book as"preparing for publication"<$$paren>
that it was all gone back; that he must not <font> speak of it <$$font>
to any one <paren> till it was made good again <$$paren>; finally that
he must send me some <font> better paper <$$font>, and also a <font>
Biographie Universelle <$$font>, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.509

for I was determined to risk ten pounds more upon it.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.510

Poor Fraser was very assiduous: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.511

I got Bookshelves put up <paren> for the whole House was <font> flowing
<$$font> with Books <$$paren>, where the <font> Biographie <$$font>
<paren> not Fraser's, however, which was countermanded, but Mill's
<$$paren>, with much else stands all ready, much readier than before:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.512

and so, having first finished out the Piece I was actually upon, I began
<font> again <$$font> at the beginning.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.513

Early the day after to-morrow <paren> after a hard and quite novel
kind of battle <$$paren> I count on having the First Chapter on paper
a second time, no worse than it was, though considerably different.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,289.514

The <P_2,290> bitterness of the business is past therefore;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.515

and you must conceive me toiling along in that new way for many weeks
to come.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.516

As for Mill I must yet tell you the best side of him.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.517

Next day after the accident he writes me a passionate Letter requesting
with boundless earnestness to be allowed to make the loss good as far
as <font> money <$$font> was concerned in it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.518

I answered: Yes, since he so desired it; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.519

for in our circumstances it was not unreasonable: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.520

in about a week he accordingly transmits me a draft for +L200;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.521

I had computed that my five months'housekeeping, etc., had cost me
+L100; which sum therefore and not two hundred was the one, I told him,
I could take.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.522

He has been here since then; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.523

but has not sent the +L100, though I suppose he will soon do it,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.524

and so the thing will end, - more handsomely than one could have expected.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.525

I ought to draw from it various practical"uses of improvement" <paren>
among others not to lend manuscripts again <$$paren>; and above all
things try to do the work <font> better <$$font> than it was; in
which case I shall never grudge the labour, but reckon it a goodhap.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,290.526

- It really seemed to me a <P_2,291> Book of considerable significance
; and not unlikely even to be of some interest at present:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.527

but that latter, and indeed all economical and other the
like considerations had become profoundly indifferent to me;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.528

I felt that I was honestly writing down and delineating a World-Fact
<paren> which the Almighty had brought to pass in the world <$$paren>;
that it was an <font> honest <$$font> work for me, and all men might
do and say of it simply what seemed good to <font> them.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.529

- Nay I have got back my spirits again <paren> after this first Chapter
<$$paren>, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.530

and hope I shall go on tolerably.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.531

I will struggle assiduously to be done with it by the time you are to be
looked for <paren> which meeting may God bring happily to pass <$$paren>
; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.532

and in that case I will cheerfully throw the business down a while,
and walk off with you to Scotland; hoping to be ready for the <font>
next <$$font> publishing season.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.533

- This is my ravelled concern, dear Jack; which you see is in the
way to knit itself up again, before I am called to tell you of it
{TEXT:missing_period} CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.534

And now for something else.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.535

I was for writing to you of it next day after it happened:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,291.536

but Jane suggested, it would only grieve you, till I <P_2,292> could say
it was in the way towards adjustment; which counsel I saw to be right.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.537

Let us hope assuredly that the whole will be for <font> good.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.538

I told you there had been a Letter from Dumfriesshire.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.539

Mrs. Welsh writes to us oftener, with full news of everything
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.540

<paren> our Mother <font> was <$$font> at Templand,
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.541

did I tell you?  <$$paren>: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.542

but she is still in Edinburgh, though soon returning now.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.543

Alick on this occasion was the correspondent: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.544

I had written to him just three days before, so that his Letter would
be put into the Post-office and mine taken <font> out <$$font> by the
same messenger; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.545

I wrote again very soon after.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.546

He has actually done with Catlinns.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.547

It was let by auction on the day advertised; to somebody for +L12 less
than his rent: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.548

that somebody I suppose is <font> glarring <$$font> and ploughing over it
<paren> poor fellow <$$paren> in these very days; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.549

and Alick marches at Whitsunday <font> first.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.550

He wanted much to have counsel: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.551

I could give him little except in general; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.552

farming seemed to me also a thing he was probably as well done with;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.553

Annan and some kind of grain-dealing there looked the likeliest.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,292.554

It seems to me not improbable that <P_2,293> he will try himself there:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.555

he was to see Ben Nelson about it, he said; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.556

his tone of temper was good; cheerful, and <font> determined <$$font>
to have another fly at it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.557

He will perhaps find himself much better situated in that way of life;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.558

there is better society to be had there; more of interest; a freer field
in several respects.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.559

He seemed very grateful for your Letter; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.560

charged me to send you his thanks over and over again.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.561

I hope we shall see him in Summer, doing better.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.562

- Our good Mother added a little postscript; in the same meek cheery
temper they are all in: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.563

Jean was to get her some ruled paper at Dumfries; with the aid of which
she might really write a very reasonable Letter.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.564

- I get a daily <font> Globe <$$font> Newspaper from Mill
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.565

<paren> he leaves it in masses, every two or three days, at a shop in
Knightsbridge <$$paren>: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.566

copies of this I circulate among them far and wide: one or two weekly to
my Mother; who also pretty regularly gets the <font> Examiner <$$font>
, furnished me by Hunt <paren> whom for the rest I do not <font> see
<$$font> once in the month <$$paren>, though I myself sometimes <font>
omit <$$font> to read it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,293.567

The aspect of Politics seems to me <P_2,294> the wretchedest;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.568

and happily there are several people here who never open their mouths
on that subject.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.569

I have sent a Newspaper or two to poor Johnstone at Haddington; to
Arbuckle, to Glen, etc. etc. CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.570

There is little other good in them: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.571

only we felt rather ashamed that Whiggism was all out a week before we
knew it, down here in our village stillness!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.572

- Peel apparently will be out soon too: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.573

and then?  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.574

<font> Des Sottises!  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.575

Your practice at Rome is literally of the profitableness that all good
work is of: for this world, Nothing.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.576

Never mind, my boy; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.577

take more of it if it offer.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.578

...  I believe Doctorship here to be at as miserable a pass as well could
be:"Homoeopathy"the ready road to fortune in it; <font> quackery <$$font>
as from of old abounding.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.579

There are two grand Homoeopathists I find: Doctor Quin, and
Doctor Bel'uomo <paren> Beautiful Man!  <$$paren> an Italian.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.580

Mrs. Buller has taken into it: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.581

finds the most <font> astonishing <$$font> relief etc. etc.
: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.582

Austin has paid off Quin.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,294.583

I could interpret all Mrs. Buller's wondrous cases-in-point:
<P_2,295> the old story of imagination and nerves, <font> Fantasiestu`cke
!  <$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.584

Dow of Irongray worked a <font> miracle <$$font> even:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.585

it is the <font> food <$$font> of quacks.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.586

- This, however, I fancy is the thing to be striven against everywhere
by the true man of every craft.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.587

I trust <paren> if God will <$$paren> we shall meet"before June be done":
I with my Volume finished, you with your Travel; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.588

and then we shall do our very best to decide on something wise.  A journey
to Scotland among the first things, - on foot!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.589

...  Our visitors and visitings are what I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} give
you account of this time: not that they are many; but that the sheet is
so near full.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.590

One Taylor <paren> Henry Taylor, who has written a <font> Philip van
Artevelde <$$font>, a good man, whose <font> laugh <$$font> reminds me
of poor Irving's <$$paren> invited me to meet Southey some weeks ago.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.591

I went CARLYLE-1835-1,2,295.592

and met Southey.  A man of clear brown complexion, large nose, <font>
no <$$font> chin, or next to none; care-lined and thought-lined brow
, vehement hazel eyes; huge mass of white hair surmounting it: a
strait-laced, limited, <P_2,296> well-instructed, well-conditioned
, excessively sensitive {COM:sic} even irritable-looking man.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.593

His irritability I think is his grand spiritual feature; as his grand
bodily is perhaps leanness and long legs: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.594

a nervous female might shriek when he rises for the first time,
and stretches to such unexpected length - like a lean pair of tongs!
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.595

We parted good friends; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.596

and may meet again, or not meet, as Destiny orders.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.597

At the same house, since that, Jane and I went to meet Wordsworth.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.598

I did not expect much; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.599

but got mostly what I expected.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.600

The old man has a fine shrewdness and naturalness in his expression of
face <paren> a long Cumberland figure <$$paren>; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.601

one finds also a kind of <font> sincerity <$$font> in his speech:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.602

but for prolixity, thinness, endless dilution it excels all the other
speech I had heard from mortal.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.603

A genuine man <paren> which is much <$$paren>, but also essentially a
<font> small <$$font> genuine man: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.604

nothing perhaps is sadder <paren> of the glad kind <$$paren> than the
<font> unbounded <$$font> laudation of such a man; sad proof of the <font>
rarity <$$font> of such.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,296.605

I fancy, however, he has fallen into the garrulity of age, and is not
what he was: also that his environment <paren> and rural Prophethood
<$$paren> <P_2,297> has hurt him much.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.606

He seems impatient that even Shakespear should be admired:"so much out
of my own pocket"!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.607

The shake of hand he gives you is feckless, egoistical;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.608

I rather fancy he <font> loves <$$font> nothing in the world so much as
one could wish.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.609

When I compare that man with a great man, - alas, he is like dwindling
into a contemptibility.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.610

Jean Paul <paren> for example <$$paren>, neither was he <font> great
<$$font>, could have worn him as a finger-ring.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.611

However when"I go to Cumberland,"Wordsworth will still be a glad sight.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.612

- I have not been fortunate in my Pen to-night; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.613

indeed for the last page I have been writing with the back of it.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.614

This and my speed will account for the confusion.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.615

Porridge has just come in.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.616

I will to bed without writing more; and finish to-morrow.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.617

Good night, dear Brother!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.618

- Ever yours!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.619

<font> Tuesday <$$font>, 3 <font> o'clock.  <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.620

- My dear Jack, I have not gone out, being so busy with this First
Chapter: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.621

congratulate me, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.622

I am <font> done <$$font> with it already!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.623

I will now walk with this up to Charing Cross after dinner; which will
still do.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,297.624

<P_2,298>

Jane has been out all morning, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.626

and could not write a postscript: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.627

she is in now, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.628

and sends you her sisterly affection, - CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.629

would like heartily, I do know, to read <font> Manzoni <$$font> with
you again.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.630

-...  Mill also has written this morning to say that he $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} think of so little as +L100: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.631

we must abide by that nevertheless, I fancy.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.632

...  Lord Jeffrey, most likely, is in Town at present:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.633

he will probably call here, but <font> not <$$font>, surely, with much
rapidity.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.634

He has my true wishes; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.635

and I <paren> theoretically <$$paren> have his: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.636

but we <font> $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <$$font> help one another.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.637

Our Mother has never said anything of Teufelsdro`ckh;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.638

but I learn from Alick that Clow of Land is <font> very <$$font> fond
of him!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.639

A certain Sir W. Molesworth <paren> a Radical Utilitarian M.P.
<$$paren> also"sent for a copy. "CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.640

Oh that I had more paper!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.641

But we shall <font> meet <$$font> if Heaven please.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.642

...  Adieu, dear Jack!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.643

finis here.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.644

Will you and Dr. Brunn walk to <font> Pasquin <$$font>
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.645

<paren> do actually <$$paren> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.646

and make my compliments to him.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,298.647

<P_2,299>

{ED:CXLI._To_his_Mother,_Scotsbrig}

Chelsea, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.650

25 <font> th March <$$font> 1835.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.651

My dear Mother - I purposed writing to you two nights ago, as you might
perhaps notice on the Newspaper; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.652

but a little man came in, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.653

and occupied the whole evening I designed for you.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.654

It turned out, however, to be"probably just as well":
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.655

for next day there arrived Jack's Roman Letter; which now can go along
with mine to make the bargain better.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.656

We are as Jack says, very lucky; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.657

and should be thankful that we hear from one another so regularly.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.658

I will only wish now, since <font> you <$$font> have delayed so long,
that our Letters may not again <font> run into one another's mouth:
<$$font> CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.659

however, in that case too, I will send you an answer the sooner, and
make matters straight again.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.660

Jack, as you will see, has nothing but good news for us:
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.661

the best is that he is <paren> we can hope <$$paren> on the way to see
us all again,"by the end of June. "CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.662

I answered him last night; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,299.663

and could not but, among other things, agree with him that it were as
well if his Travels ceased <P_2,300> after that: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.664

he will have funds for attempting a settlement somewhere;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.665

and, if he see any feasibility, ought to do it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.666

The money he speaks of will be sent forward as the last was;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.667

I will give you notice of it, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.668

and you will have to go to Dumfries; which, if Harry be in any condition ,
will perhaps do you no harm.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.669

As for that question about whether you got the <font> annual <$$font>
<paren> or interest <$$paren> regularly, I could make no answer;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.670

but hope you do.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.671

If you do not, pray apply, CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.672

and make the people pay up.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.673

I never learned either whether the houses at Ecclefechan were got
satisfactorily repaired, or how the rents come in CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.674

you complain of nothing; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.675

- but have doubtless complaints that you <font> might <$$font> make;
and which I ought to know of.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.676

In the meanwhile, dear Mother, what a satisfaction for me is it {COM:sic}
to know that you are one of these that look not either to Houses in
Ecclefechan, or any House or Possession on this poor Earth for your
comfort and stronghold!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.677

I know well that there is nothing but <font> such <$$font> a faith that
can render this Earth and her stinted allowances endurable, nay matters
of thankfulness for one.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,300.678

The cheerful <P_2,301> wise way in which you adjust yourself to so many
vicissitudes, and are always seen to be yourself in the midst of them,
should be a lesson to me and all of us.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.679

I had some occasion lately for a portion of your faith; in a most
unexpected <font> accident <$$font> <paren> what we call <font> accident
<$$font> <$$paren> that befel {COM:sic} me; of which I delayed writing
till I could not only say that I <font> would <$$font> get over it,
but that I had got over it.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.680

Be of good cheer, therefore, as to that: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.681

it is all right <paren> and for the best, I am persuaded <$$paren> ;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.682

and you shall now hear about it fully.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.683

To sum up all in a word: the <font> First Volume <$$font> of my poor
Book is utterly destroyed!  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.684

Mill, to whom I had lent it to read, and write Notes upon <paren>
for he is skilled in that subject <$$paren>, and who was full of
admiration for the bit of work, had left it carelessly out in his house
: CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.685

some of the people saw it lying; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.686

tore it up as waste paper; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.687

and when he noticed it, there were only some three or four fractions of
leaves remaining.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.688

He came hither to me, in a state looking not unlike insanity;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.689

and gasped out <paren> for he could hardly speak <$$paren> his Job's news.
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,301.690

I am very glad that got it borne <P_2,302> so well;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.691

for it was a hard thing.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.692

It never got the better of me; CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.693

and by next morning the bitterness of it was all over;
CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.694

and I had determined that there must be a finger of Providence in it;
that it meant simply I was to write the thing over again <font> truer
<$$font> than it was.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.695

My little Dame stood faithfully by me too CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.696

and was very good and brave.  CARLYLE-1835-1,2,302.697
