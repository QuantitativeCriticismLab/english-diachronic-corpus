Prognostics of the weather, &c. FORSTER1-1827-2,3.3

<$$heading>

<font> Aches and Pains <$$font> in the body of various kinds frequently
forbode rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,3.5

Persons for example subject to rheumatism feel more pain in the affected
limb or part of the body before a change of weather, particularly when
fair is to be exchanged for wet.  FORSTER1-1827-2,3.6

Old carious teeth are also troublesome, FORSTER1-1827-2,3.7

and pains in the face, ears, and gums are sometimes experienced.
FORSTER1-1827-2,3.8

Limbs once broken also ache at the place of their union,
FORSTER1-1827-2,3.9

and various other aches and pains too various and trifling to be
specified have been from time immemorial found to be signs of changes
of the weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,3.10

<font> Animals <$$font>, by some peculiar sensibility to electrical or
other atmospheric influence, often indicate changes of the weather by
their peculiar motions and habits, all which will be found under their
respective heads.  FORSTER1-1827-2,3.11

See <font> Ass, Dogs, Swallows, &c. <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,3.12

Virgil well observes on this interesting subject, FORSTER1-1827-2,3.13

{COM:latin_omitted}

<P_4>

<font> Ants.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,4.16

An universal bustle and activity observed in anthills may be generally
regarded as a sign of rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.17

The ants frequently appear all in motion together, FORSTER1-1827-2,4.18

and carry their eggs about from place to place.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.19

This is observed by Aratus, Virgil, Pliny, and others.
FORSTER1-1827-2,4.20

There are several species of ants, FORSTER1-1827-2,4.21

but we believe this prognostic to be common to nearly all of them;
FORSTER1-1827-2,4.22

nor do we know precisely to what species Virgil alluded when he said,
alluding to signs of rain, FORSTER1-1827-2,4.23

{COM:latin_omitted}

<font> Aselli <$$font> or Asini, two small stars in the constellation
of the Crab, between which is a beautiful cluster of minute stars,
which to the naked eyes appear like a nebula, and is called Praesepe,
the manger.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.25

The poets of old pretended, that when these two stars and the said nebula
became dull it foretold rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.26

It seems owing to some stars being duller in light than others that
they became the soonest obscured by the condensing of the sky into cloud
before rain; as, for instance, the two small stars of the Aselli in the
constellation of the Crab, of whose peculiar prognostic so much is said
by Aratus.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.27

The Pleiades are remarkably brilliant for their size.
FORSTER1-1827-2,4.28

One should expect that the light of the different Stars would produce
differences in the coloured halos seen sometimes to surround them.
FORSTER1-1827-2,4.29

The original composition of the light of the different stars is very
different, FORSTER1-1827-2,4.30

and consequently no general tables of refraction can be constructed to
apply to all stars.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.31

Aldebaran, Arcturus, Betulgeus, and Alpliard, for instance, are red stars;
Capella, yellow; and Sirius, Procyon, and Atair, white: while Lyra and
Spica Virginis are blueish.  FORSTER1-1827-2,4.32

The planets differ much <font> inter se.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,4.33

<P_5>

<font> Asses.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,5.35

When asses bray more than ordinary, particularly if they shake their
ears as if uneasy, it is said to predict rain, and particularly showers.
FORSTER1-1827-2,5.36

I have noticed, that in showery weather a donkey confined in a yard
near the house, has brayed before every shower, and generally some
minutes before the rain has fallen, as if some electrical influence,
produced by the concentrating power of the approaching raincloud, caused
a tickling in the windpipe of the animal, just before the shower came up.
FORSTER1-1827-2,5.37

Whatever this electric state of the air preceding a shower may be,
it seems to be the same that causes in other animals some peculiar
sensations, which makes the peacock squall, the pintado call"
comeback,"and which creates a variety of prognosticative motions in the
different species of the animal kingdom.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.38

At the same time old wounds, decayed teeth, and bones that have been
broken begin to ache.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.39

See these articles.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.40

An expressive adage says, When that the ass begins to bray, Be sure we
shall have rain that day.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.41

We have repeatedly been able to give our haymakers useful admonitions
founded solely on the braying of the ass.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.42

Thus the proverb says truly, $'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} time to cock your hay
and corn When the old donkey blows his horn.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.43

<font> Bats <$$font> flitting about late in the evening in spring
and autumn, at which seasons they are most commonly seen, foretell
a fine day on the morrow, as do dorbeetles, and some other insects.
FORSTER1-1827-2,5.44

On the contrary, when bats return soon to their hiding places, and send
forth loud cries, bad weather may be expected.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.45

In April 1809, at Wokey Hole, near Wells, we saw many hundreds of torpid
bats clinging to the roofs of that great cave.  FORSTER1-1827-2,5.46

<P_6>

<font> Barometer.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,6.48

There is no instrument now more generally used for ascertaining the
coming weather than the barometer.  FORSTER1-1827-2,6.49

It may however be remarked, that it is more from its rising or falling ,
than from its height or lowness that we are to infer fair or foul weather.
FORSTER1-1827-2,6.50

Generally speaking, the rising of the mercury presages clear fair weather,
and its falling, foul weather; as rain, snow, high winds, and storms.
FORSTER1-1827-2,6.51

In very hot weather, the falling of the mercury indicates thunder.
FORSTER1-1827-2,6.52

In winter the rising indicates frost, FORSTER1-1827-2,6.53

and in frosty weather, if the mercury fall three or four divisions,
there will follow a thaw; FORSTER1-1827-2,6.54

but in a continued frost, if the mercury rise, it will snow.
FORSTER1-1827-2,6.55

When foul weather happens soon after the falling of the mercury, expect
but little of it; FORSTER1-1827-2,6.56

and, on the contrary, expect but little fair weather when it proves fair
shortly after the mercury has risen.  FORSTER1-1827-2,6.57

In foul weather, when the mercury rises much and high, and so continues
for two or three days before the foul weather is quite over, then expect
a continuance of fair weather to follow.  FORSTER1-1827-2,6.58

In fair weather, when the mercury falls much and low, and thus continues
for two or three days before the rain comes, then expect a great deal
of wet, and probably high winds.  FORSTER1-1827-2,6.59

The unsettled motion of the mercury denotes uncertain and changeable
weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,6.60

The words engraved on the register plate of the barometer, it may be
observed, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be strictly relied upon to correspond
exactly with the state of the weather; though it will in general agree
with them as to the mercury rising and falling.  FORSTER1-1827-2,6.61

When the thermometer and barometer rise together in summer, with
rain in large drops, a wholesome state of the atmosphere is at hand.
FORSTER1-1827-2,6.62

<P_7>

A great and sudden rising of the barometer, that is to say, a great
accession of atmospherical pressure, will, in some persons, occasion
a slight temporary difficulty of hearing and tingling in the ears,
similar to that which is experienced in descending from high mountains,
or from the air in balloons.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.64

<font> Balloons <$$font> have been made use of to ascertain the direction
of upper currents of air; FORSTER1-1827-2,7.65

and as their currents by degrees get lower and support the current
blowing near the earth's surface, we may often by means of small air
balloons foretell what will be the direction of the breeze at the next
change of wind.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.66

See <font> Current, Kite, <$$font> &c. FORSTER1-1827-2,7.67

<font> Berries <$$font> in the hedges often forbode a hard winter,
FORSTER1-1827-2,7.68

and severe weather frequently occurs in seasons when they are particularly
plentiful on the Maybush and Blackthorn.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.69

This rule is not however without its exceptions.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.70

But, at all events, peculiarities of the seasons have a wonderful
influence on the quantity of berries, particularly those of Holy
{COM:sic}.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.71

In winter 1823-4 they were very numerous, though the season was mild.
FORSTER1-1827-2,7.72

In 1824-5 scarcely one was to be seen; FORSTER1-1827-2,7.73

the season was also mild.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.74

The peculiarities of the seasons, and their influence on plants,
constitute a very curious subject of research; FORSTER1-1827-2,7.75

it comprehends the whole doctrine of special blights, whereby only
certain tribes of plants are affected.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.76

For example, the summer of 1810 killed the plane-trees almost every
where in this island.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.77

The spring of 1824 destroyed the mezereon shrubs.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.78

Epidemics and epizooties come under the same class, FORSTER1-1827-2,7.79

and are referable to specific conditions of the atmosphere.
FORSTER1-1827-2,7.80

<font> Beetles <$$font> flying about late in an evening often foretell
a fine day on the morrow.  FORSTER1-1827-2,7.81

<font> Blue Sky.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,7.82

When there is a piece of blue sky seen in a rainy day big enough,
as the proverb says, <P_8>"to make a Dutchman a pair of breeches,
"we shall probably have a fine afternoon.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.83

<font> Bones <$$font> which have once been broken, and are reunited
, are apt to ache before rain at the place of their re-union.
FORSTER1-1827-2,8.84

See <font> Aches and Pains.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,8.85

<font> Butterflies, <$$font> when they appear early, are sometimes
forerunners of fine weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.86

The first sort which appears in spring is the sulphur butterfly <font>
Papilio sulphurea proecox, <$$font> whose wings are of a pale greenish
yellow.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.87

These come in March if the weather be fine and warm.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.88

The next sort are the tortoiseshell butterflies, early in April.
FORSTER1-1827-2,8.89

And in May come the common white or cabbage butterflies.
FORSTER1-1827-2,8.90

Moths and Sphinxes are also signs of fine weather, when they are common
in an evening.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.91

<font> Calm.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,8.92

A dead calm often precedes a violent gale; FORSTER1-1827-2,8.93

and sometimes the calmest and clearest mornings, in certain seasons,
are followed by a blowing showery day.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.94

Calms are forerunners of the hurricanes of the West Indies and other
tropical climes.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.95

<font> Candles, <$$font> as well as lamps, often afford good prognostics
of weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.96

When the flames of candles flare and snap, or burn with an unsteady
or dim light, rain, and frequently wind also, are found to follow.
FORSTER1-1827-2,8.97

The excrescences from the wicks called funguses also denote rain and wind.
FORSTER1-1827-2,8.98

The curious forms assumed by the excrescent wicks of candles has led to
many superstitions.  FORSTER1-1827-2,8.99

We quote the following from a calendarian account of Childermas.
FORSTER1-1827-2,8.100

"In the year 1819, on the Eve of the Holy Innocents, the wick of a
candle, left for a long time unsnuffed, had by degrees assumed a complete
cruciform shape, which being viewed by the common people a standing up
amidst the gloomy <P_9> flame of the candle, was fearfully set down by
the people as a memento of the sufferings of Jesus Christ on the cross,
who, as they fancied, mysteriously declared thus again, by appearing in
a flame, <font> I am the light that lighteth every man that cometh into
the world.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,9.101

The fearful appearance of this phenomenon was rendered more impressive
to the minds of the credulous, in consequence of its happening on the
vigil of Childermas, which has been ever regarded a day of unlucky omens.

<font> Candlemas Day.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,9.105

If this day be clear and frosty it is said that winter will be still of
some continuance, and that the weather will be colder after the festival
than before, according with the old proverb, FORSTER1-1827-2,9.106

{COM:latin_omitted}

We have noticed this to be a critical time of the year with respect
to the weather, and that when mild and wet, winter is actually gone,
and we may calculate on no more frost.  FORSTER1-1827-2,9.108

Another metrical proverb, frequently quoted in Poor Robin's, Moore's,
and other Almanacks, reminds us, If Candlemas day be fair and bright,
Winter will have another flight; FORSTER1-1827-2,9.109

But if Candlemas day be clouds and rain, Winter is gone
FORSTER1-1827-2,9.110

and will not come again.  FORSTER1-1827-2,9.111

<font> Cats <$$font> are said, when they wash their faces, or when they
seem sleepy and dull, to foretell rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,9.112

The same is said of them when they appear irritable and restless, and
play with their tails.  FORSTER1-1827-2,9.113

<font> Cattle, <$$font> when they gambol about in their pastures more
than ordinary, foreshew rain, and in general a change of weather.
FORSTER1-1827-2,9.114

<P_10>

<font> Chickens, <$$font> when they pick up small stones and pebbles, and
are more noisy than usual, afford, according to Aratus, a sign of rain.
FORSTER1-1827-2,10.116

Other authors prognosticate the coming of rain from the habit fowls have
of rubbing in the dust, and clapping their wings; FORSTER1-1827-2,10.117

but this applies to several sorts of fowls, as well as to the gallinaceous
{TEXT:gullinaceous} kind.  FORSTER1-1827-2,10.118

<font> Cherryclacks <$$font> offer admonitions of the existence and
nature of the gales and breezes by night.  FORSTER1-1827-2,10.119

In the cherry season of July, the noise of these scare-birds is often
troublesome, as the following lines from the <font> Anthologia Bor.
et Aus. <$$font> so naturally remind us: FORSTER1-1827-2,10.120

{COM:verse_omitted}

There is no doubt that a whistler, to scream by the wind, might be so
constructed as to point out the fluctuating strength of the blowing gale.
FORSTER1-1827-2,10.122

<P_11>

<font> Chilliness, <$$font> and a sensation of cold greater than the
indication of temperature by the thermometer leads us to expect, often
forebodes rain, as it shews that there is already an increased moisture in
the air, which experience has shewn to be referable to its decomposition
and the first formation of cloud.  FORSTER1-1827-2,11.124

<font> Cirrostratus <$$font> or Wanecloud whenever it prevails usually
forebodes rain, snow, or hail; FORSTER1-1827-2,11.125

but there are, nevertheless, some nice distinctions to be made,
and which a discriminating meteorologist may soon learn to make.
FORSTER1-1827-2,11.126

For example; when a plain sheet of the wanecloud is spread over a large
surface at eventide, or when the sky gradually thickens with this cloud,
a fall of steady rain is usually the consequence.  FORSTER1-1827-2,11.127

Before storms we see sometimes a curious sort of wanecloud, consisting
of bars curiously carved like the cyma of architectural ornaments.
FORSTER1-1827-2,11.128

But the forms of this cloud are very various, FORSTER1-1827-2,11.129

and the peculiar indications of each of them have not yet been duly
noticed.  FORSTER1-1827-2,11.130

This cloud has been defined <font> a shallow extended cloud, subconcave
or undulated, or a congeries of small clouds of this sort.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,11.131

The figure of the cirrostratus, like that of the cirrus, is very various:
FORSTER1-1827-2,11.132

sometimes it consists in dense longitudinal streaks;
FORSTER1-1827-2,11.133

at others it looks like shoals of fish; FORSTER1-1827-2,11.134

sometimes the whole sky is so mottled with it as to give the idea of
the back of the mackerel; FORSTER1-1827-2,11.135

this has been called the mackerel-back sky: FORSTER1-1827-2,11.136

frequently it appears like the grains of polished wood,
FORSTER1-1827-2,11.137

or is composed of fine fibres, disposed after the manner of the fibres of
muscles, which often intersect each <P_12> other.  FORSTER1-1827-2,12.138

I have seen the cirrostratus assume the reticular form, like the cirrus
, from which it can then only be distinguished by its greater degree
of density.  FORSTER1-1827-2,12.139

This cloud is sometimes spread out into a plane horizontal sheet, more
or less dense; FORSTER1-1827-2,12.140

this is the form in which the halo generally appears.
FORSTER1-1827-2,12.141

All clouds are capable of becoming lighter or darker, according to their
relative position with respect to the sun: FORSTER1-1827-2,12.142

the cirrostratus, however, is remarkable for exhibiting a great
variety of beautiful colours, according to its variation in density,
to other peculiarities in its structure, or to its relative position.
FORSTER1-1827-2,12.143

These appearances are best seen in the morning and evening, when the
sun is near to the horizon.  FORSTER1-1827-2,12.144

They have been well described by the ancient poets, who have likewise
described them as precursors of rain and tempestuous weather.
FORSTER1-1827-2,12.145

Virgil, speaking of the prognostics of rain, alludes to several
appearances which must be ascribed to the intervention of this cloud:
FORSTER1-1827-2,12.146

{COM:latin_omitted}

<P_13>

{COM:latin_omitted}

<font> Cirrocumulus <$$font> or Sondercloud is a congeries of
small roundish little clouds in close horizontal apposition.
FORSTER1-1827-2,13.150

The cirrocumulus is not always uniform in its appearance;
FORSTER1-1827-2,13.151

it varies in the size and rotundity of its constituent nubiculae, and
in their closer or more distant arrangement.  FORSTER1-1827-2,13.152

It is frequent in summer, FORSTER1-1827-2,13.153

and often forms very beautiful skies: FORSTER1-1827-2,13.154

at all times of the year it may be seen, in the intervals of showers,
and before an increase of temperature, of which its prevalence is a
pretty certain prognostic.  FORSTER1-1827-2,13.155

Before thunderstorms a very dense sphere of this cloud may be noticed,
whose nubiculae are close, compact, and very round, and indicate a high
electrical change.  FORSTER1-1827-2,13.156

The poet Bloomfield beautifully describes the appearance of these
clouds floating in large beds at different altitudes by moonlight:
{COM:verse_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,13.157

<font> Cirrus <$$font> or Curlcloud.  FORSTER1-1827-2,13.158

- When, after much fine weather, this cloud first appears like a white
line pencilled along on the azure sky, we may generally reckon on a
change; FORSTER1-1827-2,13.159

and if the cloud increases, and others are added to it laterally, or if
<P_14> it change to the wanecloud, rain will probably follow before long.
FORSTER1-1827-2,14.160

The tufts of cirrus, called mares'tails, are known to be a sign of wind,
which has frequently been found to blow from the quarter to which these
curl-clouds have previously pointed.  FORSTER1-1827-2,14.161

In wet weather, when the air is damp, the cirrus, which is seen in the
intervals of the rain, is ill defined, and often of a plumose figure;
FORSTER1-1827-2,14.162

and has less of the fibrous structure: FORSTER1-1827-2,14.163

this may be attributed to its being surrounded with moister air,
which being a conductor, though an imperfect one, there is not the
same necessity for the cirrus to be drawn out into fine transmitting
points; as the fluid would fly off more generally from all parts of it.
FORSTER1-1827-2,14.164

Cirri of this kind are generally of short duration; FORSTER1-1827-2,14.165

there is often a haziness in the atmosphere when they appear,
FORSTER1-1827-2,14.166

and they are soon followed by rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,14.167

They seldom appear in fair weather; FORSTER1-1827-2,14.168

and if cirri, which have been previously fibrous, put on the plumose
and indefinite character, a change to wet weather may be expected.
FORSTER1-1827-2,14.169

<font> Clouds <$$font> of any sort, when they increase much, portend rain,
particularly at eventide; FORSTER1-1827-2,14.170

when they are very red they often foreshew wind; when they form a dappled
grey sky, with north wind, fair weather; when they rapidly form and
evaporate, variable weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,14.171

Clouds fretted and spotted covering the sky after fine weather, or wavy
like the undulation of the sea, forbode rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,14.172

- See <font> Stratus, Cirrus, <$$font> &c. FORSTER1-1827-2,14.173

<font> Colours <$$font> of various kinds, in the sky and clouds, tokens
severally of different phenomena.  FORSTER1-1827-2,14.174

Much red always forebodes wind and rain, particularly in <P_15> the
morning; FORSTER1-1827-2,15.175

in the evening it sometimes indicates a fine day, particularly if the
morning be grey.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.176

A proverb says, An evening red and a morning grey Will set the traveller
on his way; FORSTER1-1827-2,15.177

But an evening grey and a morning red Will pour down rain on the
pilgrim's head.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.178

It comes from the Italian, {COM:italian_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,15.179

A greenish colour of the sky near to the horizon, often shews that we
may expect more wet weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.180

The most beautiful and varied tints are seen in autumn,
FORSTER1-1827-2,15.181

and in that season the purple of the falling haze is often a sign of a
continuation of fine weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.182

When the clouds become more coloured than ordinary, and particularly when
red prevails, it sometimes indicates an east wind.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.183

<font> Cold and Heat.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,15.184

The coldest weather, on an average, happens in the middle of January,
and the hottest in the middle of July.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.185

In July 13th and 14th, 1808, the thermometer stood at 94=o= and 96=o=
of $Fahrenheit {TEXT:Farenheit}, in the shade.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.186

"Excessive cold weather occurred on the 14th of January, 1820.
FORSTER1-1827-2,15.187

The quicksilver in my thermometer fell to 5=o= at eleven o'clock at night.
FORSTER1-1827-2,15.188

Another thermometer was also observed, hanging in a window in the house,
to be likewise much below Zero.  FORSTER1-1827-2,15.189

At the same time, and during the night, I ascertained by a Six's
thermometer, that the cold had been 10=o=, that is ten degrees below
of Fahrenheit's scale, or forty degrees below the freezing point.
FORSTER1-1827-2,15.190

This extraordinary degree of cold <P_16> appeared to be partial, and to
occur in a particular line of places, as if a stream of excessive cold air
were drawn along over partial tracts of country.  "FORSTER1-1827-2,16.191

- <font> Atmospheric Phenomena.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,16.192

The nearer approach of small birds to the windows of our habitations
usually forebode cold weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.193

<font> Cocks, <$$font> when they crow at unwonted hours, often foretell
a change of weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.194

We have often noticed this before rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.195

But this is by no means so certain a sign as many others, because at
particular seasons, and in particular kinds of weather, cocks habitually
crow all day.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.196

During the calm, still, dry, dark, and warm weather sometimes
occurring in the winter months, and which may be called the halcyon
days of our climate, cocks keep a constant crowing all night and day.
FORSTER1-1827-2,16.197

There appear to be three principal cock crowings in ordinary weather,
namely, about midnight or soon after, about three in the morning, and
at daybreak; FORSTER1-1827-2,16.198

the latter is never omitted.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.199

We have noticed, however, that when cocks crow all day, in
summer particularly a change to rain has frequently followed.
FORSTER1-1827-2,16.200

Shakespeare, in <font> Hamlet, <$$font> has a well known and beautiful
passage relative to the crowing of cocks all night at Christmas.
FORSTER1-1827-2,16.201

The fact is, that during the dark months of midwinter these fowls actually
do crow on some occasions the whole of the night.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.202

Cocks are said to clap their wings in an unusual manner before rain,
and hens to rub in the dust and seem very uneasy.  FORSTER1-1827-2,16.203

<P_17>

<font> Coronas <$$font> round the sun or moon portend rain.
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.205

Coloured crowns of light, and compounded halos, are more sure signs of
a fall.  FORSTER1-1827-2,17.206

See <font> Halo.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,17.207

<font> Cream and Milk <$$font> when they turn sour in the night often
indicate thereby that thunderstorms are about, and will probably shortly
take place.  FORSTER1-1827-2,17.208

The effect is referable to the electricity of the air at the time.
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.209

<font> Cranes <$$font> are said of old to foretel rain,
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.210

and on this subject there is a passage in Virgil about which the learned
have always disputed much as to its exact import: FORSTER1-1827-2,17.211

{COM:latin_omitted}

The passage in Aratus <paren> Dios. 300 <$$paren> from which the
Virgilian prognostic is taken, certainly favours the notion that the
cranes retreat to the valleys, and return from their aerial flight when
they foresee rain coming.  FORSTER1-1827-2,17.213

See the Prognostics of Theophrastus, and also Aristotle's <font>
Hist. Anim. <$$font> ix. 10.  and Prof.
Heyne's Virgil, <font> Not. $ad {TEXT:ad.} Georg. <$$font>
i. 375.  FORSTER1-1827-2,17.214

Buhl, the editor of Aratus, also adopts this explanation.
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.215

The high flight of cranes in silence indicates fine weather.
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.216

<font> Crocuses, <$$font> particularly the yellow crocus, generally
blow in our gardens about the feast of St. Valentine,
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.217

and are hence called <font> Hymen's torch, <$$font> and <font> flame
of Hymen.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,17.218

They blow through March, FORSTER1-1827-2,17.219

and decay in April.  FORSTER1-1827-2,17.220

The striped crocus comes later, as do the white, the blue and white,
and the blue; this last seldom blowing till the beginning of March.
FORSTER1-1827-2,17.221

<P_18>

<font> Crows <$$font> utter a peculiar cry before rain, different
from their usual voice, as is noticed by Aratus and Virgil.
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.223

<font> Corvus aquat.  <$$font> is quite a common proverb,
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.224

but this may also allude to the <font> Raven, <$$font> which see.
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.225

<font> Currents of Air <$$font> change their course frequently in the
higher regions of the air first, FORSTER1-1827-2,18.226

and are afterwards continued to the earth's surface;
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.227

hence we can often foresee a change of the wind by observing the way in
which the clouds above move.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.228

Both the strength of a coming gale, and the point of the compass from
which it will blow, may usually be foreseen some time beforehand by
noticing the velocity and direction of the clouds floating along in the
upper current, or by means of baloons {COM:sic}.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.229

<font> Cumulus <$$font> or Stackencloud is that large and irregular
hemispherical kind of cloud which, in fair weather, usually forms in
the day and subsides in the evening.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.230

These clouds, when they are very irregular in their shapes, when they are
full of protuberances and fleeces, or when their fleeces curl inwards
as they pass along in the wind, indicate rainy or showery weather.
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.231

Their increase, instead of vanishing, at eventide also portends the same
thing, as does their change into twainclouds.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.232

<font> Cumulostratus <$$font> or Twaincloud compared with cumulus,
which it resembles, is more dense, FORSTER1-1827-2,18.233

and overhangs its base in uneven or rugged folds; FORSTER1-1827-2,18.234

a pre-existing cirrus, cirrocumulus, or cirrostratus, or one
perhaps immediately formed for the occasion, alights on its summit,
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.235

and inosculates.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.236

Many of these cirrostrati are sometimes seen attached to the cumulostratus
, and sometimes to intersect it.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.237

Cumulostrati frequently remain in this state for a long time,
FORSTER1-1827-2,18.238

and constitute very picturesque skies.  FORSTER1-1827-2,18.239

<P_19>

At other times the processes are more rapid.  FORSTER1-1827-2,19.241

The cirri, or cirrostrati are soon lost in the cumulostratus, which
increases in density, and soon becomes the nimbus described in its
proper place.  FORSTER1-1827-2,19.242

See <font> Nimbus.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,19.243

The cumulostratus is one of the stages in the process by which rain
is ultimately effected, of which it may therefore be regarded as a
prognostic.  FORSTER1-1827-2,19.244

In Switzerland, Wales, Spain, and other mountainous countries, it may be
confounded at a distance, in its early stages, with distant mountains.
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.245

<font> Dandelion <$$font> the <font> Taraxacum Dens Leonis <$$font> is
a common plant, which flowers early, and remains in blow more or less
all the year.  FORSTER1-1827-2,19.246

The general flowering, however, of this plant takes place about the 8th
of April, FORSTER1-1827-2,19.247

and for a month it bespangles the fields, mixing agreeably with the daisy.
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.248

<font> Daffodillies, <$$font> of which there are several sorts, blow in
March and April; FORSTER1-1827-2,19.249

the early daffodil comes about the 10th of March; FORSTER1-1827-2,19.250

the great double variety is called <font> Lent Lily.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.251

There are several kinds which blow later in the month.
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.252

<font> Dead Nettles <$$font> blow early and all the year;
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.253

the red, or purple kind, are scarce all winter.  FORSTER1-1827-2,19.254

They afford a sign of a mild season when they come in winter in abundance.
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.255

<font> Dolphins, <$$font> as well as <font> Porpuses, <$$font> when they
come about a ship, and sport and gambol on the surface of the water,
betoken a storm; FORSTER1-1827-2,19.256

hence they are regarded as unlucky omens for sailors.
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.257

According to ancient fable they formerly offered themselves in times of
storm to convey shipwrecked mariners to the shore; FORSTER1-1827-2,19.258

but this is, of course, a story of a mere human invention.
FORSTER1-1827-2,19.259

The fable of Arion is well known.  FORSTER1-1827-2,19.260

<P_20>

<font> Donkey, <$$font> brays before rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.262

See <font> Ass.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,20.263

<font> Dogs, <$$font> before rain, grow sleepy and dull,
FORSTER1-1827-2,20.264

and lay drowsily before the fire, FORSTER1-1827-2,20.265

and are not easily aroused.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.266

They also often eat grass, which indicates that their stomachs, like ours,
are apt to be disturbed before change of weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.267

It is also said to be a sign of change of weather when dogs howl and
bark much in the night; FORSTER1-1827-2,20.268

they certainly do this much at the full moon, which has given rise to
the saying relative to the <font> Dogs that bay at the moon.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,20.269

Dogs also dig in the earth with their feet before rain,
FORSTER1-1827-2,20.270

and often make deep holes in the ground.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.271

<font> Dreams <$$font> of a hurrying and frightful nature, also
incubus, and other symptoms of oppressed and imperfect sleep, are
frequent indications that the weather is changed or about to change.
FORSTER1-1827-2,20.272

Many persons experience these nocturnal symptoms on a change of wind,
particularly when it becomes east.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.273

In all these cases the effect seems to be produced immediately on the
nervous system, and through it on the stomach, so that the stomach shall
again re-act on the sensorium.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.274

The symptoms are enhanced by a full stomach and other sources of
indigestion.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.275

See <font> Wind, <$$font> also <font> East Wind.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,20.276

<font> Drains <$$font> and sespools {COM:sic} smell stronger than usual
before rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.277

<font> Drowsiness <$$font> and heavy sleep, both in men and animals,
often forebodes a heavy fall of rain or snow.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.278

<font> Ducks.  <$$font> - FORSTER1-1827-2,20.279

The loud and clamorous quackling of ducks, geese, and other waterfowl,
is a sign of rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.280

It is also a sign of rain when they wash themselves, and flutter about
in the water more than usual.  FORSTER1-1827-2,20.281

Virgil has well described all these habits of aquatic birds.
FORSTER1-1827-2,20.282

See <font> Geese.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,20.283

<P_21>

The above prognostics apply to various other species of water birds.
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.285

See our article <font> Virgilian Prognostics.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.286

<font> Ears, <$$font> when there is a tingling noise, or what is called
a staging in them, afford thereby a sign of a change of weather, not
simply of rain, as has been said, but of barometrical pressure in general.
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.287

The sudden increase of pressure, like the descent from high mountains ,
or from balloons, causes in many persons a temporary deafness and roaring
in the ears.  FORSTER1-1827-2,21.288

A sudden fall of the barometer affects also the ears, but in a different
manner, like mounting a high hill.  FORSTER1-1827-2,21.289

<font> East Wind <$$font> is frequently made known to nervous people
in the night by imperfect sleep, headache, and hurrying dreams.
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.290

It is remarkable that good astronomical observations $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be made when the wind is east.  FORSTER1-1827-2,21.291

And frequently when the celestial objects seem to wave and move
about in the field of the telescope, an east wind is found to follow,
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.292

for it has already began above in the higher regions of the air.
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.293

<font> Eclipse Weather <$$font> is a popular term in the south of
England for the weather following an eclipse of the sun or moon,
FORSTER1-1827-2,21.294

and it is vulgarly esteemed tempestuous, and not to be depended upon by
the husbandman.  FORSTER1-1827-2,21.295

<font> Epidemics <$$font> are disorders of health brought on by
atmospherical influence; FORSTER1-1827-2,21.296

and modern discoveries have shown how much most prevailing diseases
partake of an epidemical nature.  FORSTER1-1827-2,21.297

Scarlet fever, typhus, the plague, and indeed most diseases of this sort,
are now considered epidemical.  FORSTER1-1827-2,21.298

It would seem that there were a most immediate connexion between the
peculiar state of the air and the kind of disorders which might be
thereby <P_22> excited.  FORSTER1-1827-2,22.299

For it may be observed, that even of those disorders which are not
generally admitted to be contagious, one particular kind will prevail
for a long time.  FORSTER1-1827-2,22.300

Thus, in winter, the different symptoms of that state of body which we
call a cold, appear, in some measure, to prevail and vary together; so
that it is common to hear people talking of the fashionable complaint.
FORSTER1-1827-2,22.301

Coughs, for a while, are the prevailing symptoms; FORSTER1-1827-2,22.302

then sore throats are the most common.  FORSTER1-1827-2,22.303

It is in spring that certain kinds of cutaneous eruptions usually appear;
and in autumn, that those irregularities in the functions of the digestive
viscera, called cholera morbus, &c. happen , and which have been
erroneously attributed to eating much fruit.  FORSTER1-1827-2,22.304

On the other hand, it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be considered that
atmospheric peculiarities alone produce epidemic and other complaints,
which must be regarded as having a compound origin, and as resulting from
the operation of peculiar states of atmosphere on persons of particular
states of constitution; FORSTER1-1827-2,22.305

otherwise all persons would be affected, which is contrary to experience.
FORSTER1-1827-2,22.306

There are, probably, innumerable varieties of temperament of general
habits of life, and, of pre-existing diseases, which, in different
subjects, vary the effects of the air.  FORSTER1-1827-2,22.307

And many persons, perhaps, enjoy a state of health, and perfect action
, which may be capable of resisting its evil influence altogether.
FORSTER1-1827-2,22.308

It would, perhaps, be productive of useful results, if physicians of
extensive practice would make accurate meteorological registers during the
prevalence of any epidemic or contagious disorders: such as the influenza
, which, a few years ago, took a range of some miles round London, but
was also prevalent in other parts of the country.  FORSTER1-1827-2,22.309

<P_23>

<font> Epizootie <$$font> is a name for epidemic disorders occurring
among animals, of which we have many and various instances on record.
FORSTER1-1827-2,23.311

The state of the electrometer and other atmospherical instruments
should be carefully examined during the prevalence of such pestilences.
FORSTER1-1827-2,23.312

<font> Erodius <$$font> is the name of some seabird, the species not
being precisely ascertained, of which Aratus writes a great deal, as
being a bird of ominous import.  FORSTER1-1827-2,23.313

{COM:greek_omitted}

Various other prognostics are by the same author deduced from this bird.
FORSTER1-1827-2,23.315

But indeed the writings of the ancients abound with allusions to the
indicative use of seafowls.  FORSTER1-1827-2,23.316

See"Arati Diosemeri,"edited by T. Forster, London, 8vo.
1815, p. 26.  FORSTER1-1827-2,23.317

The above quotation evidently alludes to a prognostic of wind.
FORSTER1-1827-2,23.318

In another place Aratus describes the flight of the bird to the sea,
and his shrill cry before rain, FORSTER1-1827-2,23.319

{COM:greek_omitted}

This prognostic is confirmed by Aristotle and by Theophrastus.
FORSTER1-1827-2,23.321

<font> Fair Weather.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,23.322

- The absence of those circumstances which forebode or accompany foul
weather, may generally be considered as indicating a return of fair.
FORSTER1-1827-2,23.323

Virgil mentions the clear and bright appearance of the moon and stars ,
after they have long been hazy and confused, and other signs, to indicate
approaching serenity.  FORSTER1-1827-2,23.324

{COM:latin_omitted}

<P_24>

{COM:latin_omitted} <font> Falling Stars, <$$font> a small kind of
meteors, forbode a change, particularly wind, of which Aratus and Virgil
remind us.  FORSTER1-1827-2,24.327

Aratus observes in his Diosemea: {COM:greek_omitted} And Virgil:
{COM:latin_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,24.328

<font> Feathers, <$$font> pieces of flue, or dry leaves, playing about
on the surface of ponds and other waters, as if agitated by light and
varying eddies of wind, often forbode rain, of which both Theophrastus
and Aratus remind us.  FORSTER1-1827-2,24.329

To other signs, Virgil adds, {COM:latin_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,24.330

<font> Fieldfares, <$$font> when they arrive early and in great abundance
in autumn, foreshew a hard winter, which <P_25> has probably set in,
in the regions from which they have come.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.331

They usually come in November.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.332

<font> Fishes, <$$font> when they bite more readily, and gambol near the
surface of the streams or ponds, foreshew rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.333

<font> Fire.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,25.334

- The brightness and heat of the fire in winter, often indicates frost
and clear weather, as does the lodgment of the moisture on the windows ;
FORSTER1-1827-2,25.335

for it demonstrates a cold atmosphere abroad.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.336

When the fire burns dull, damp weather and non-electric rain often follow:
FORSTER1-1827-2,25.337

it is said that the air on these occasions has less of oxygen.
FORSTER1-1827-2,25.338

The real cause however is unknown.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.339

<font> Flowers <$$font> are many of them excellent indicators of the
approaching weather by their opening and shutting, and other motions.
FORSTER1-1827-2,25.340

See <font> Pimpernel, <$$font> &c. FORSTER1-1827-2,25.341

<font> Fleeces, and Mares'Tails, <$$font> as they are called, seen in
the sky, are signs of rain and wind.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.342

By fleeces are meant those clouds which look like fleeces of wool, which
the Greeks described as being {COM:greek_omitted}.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.343

Virgil also, speaking of fine weather, alludes to the absence of these
clouds: {COM:latin_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,25.344

Mares'Tails are the comoid Curlclouds called Cirri: FORSTER1-1827-2,25.345

their prevalence forbodes wind.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.346

They look sometimes like distended locks of hair.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.347

<font> Flies, <$$font> and various sorts of volatile insects, become
more troublesome, FORSTER1-1827-2,25.348

and sting FORSTER1-1827-2,25.349

and bite more than usual before, as well as in the intervals of rainy
weather, particularly in autumn, when they are very numerous, and often
become a great nuisance.  FORSTER1-1827-2,25.350

This observation applies to several sorts of flies.
FORSTER1-1827-2,25.351

The horseflies likewise of all sorts are more troublesome before
the fall of rain, and particularly when the weather is warm.
FORSTER1-1827-2,25.352

<P_26>

<font> Flora's Clock, <$$font> is a term used to denote the periodical
opening of flowers, whereby the hours of the day are indicated.
FORSTER1-1827-2,26.354

Thus the Yellow Star of Jerusalem, <font> Tragopogon pratensis, <$$font>
as well as the Purple Star of Jerusalem, <font> T. porrifolius,
<$$font> close their flowers exactly at noon.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.355

The Syngenecious plants in general have periods independent of the
variations of the weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.356

The Four o'clock Flower in Jamaica is well known, FORSTER1-1827-2,26.357

and so are many others.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.358

The Evening Primrose, <font> Oenatherp biennis, <$$font> opens at sunset
FORSTER1-1827-2,26.359

and closes at daybreak; FORSTER1-1827-2,26.360

it opens with a snapping noise.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.361

The flower of the Garden Lettuce, which is in a vertical plane, opens
at seven o'clock, FORSTER1-1827-2,26.362

and shuts at ten.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.363

A species of serpentine Aloes, without prickles, whose large and beautiful
flowers exhale a strong odour of the Vanilla, during the time of its
expansion, which is very short, is cultivated in the imperial garden
at Paris.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.364

It does not blow till towards the months of July, and about five o'clock
in the evening, at which time it gradually opens its petals, expands them,
droops, and dies.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.365

By ten o'clock the same night it is totally withered, to the great
astonishment of the spectators, who flock in crowds to see it.
FORSTER1-1827-2,26.366

The Cerea, a native of Jamaica and Vera Cruz, expands a beautiful coral
flower, FORSTER1-1827-2,26.367

and emits a flagrant odour, for a few hours in the night,
FORSTER1-1827-2,26.368

and then closes to open no more.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.369

The flower is near a foot in diameter; the inside of the calyx of a
splendid yellow; FORSTER1-1827-2,26.370

and the numeral {COM:sic} petals are of a pure white.
FORSTER1-1827-2,26.371

It begins to open about seven or eight o'clock in the evening,
FORSTER1-1827-2,26.372

and closes before sunrise in the morning.  FORSTER1-1827-2,26.373

The flower of the Dandelion possesses very peculiar means of sheltering
itself from the heat of the <P_27> sun, as it closes entirely whenever
the heat becomes excessive.  FORSTER1-1827-2,27.374

It has been observed to open, in summer, at half an hour after five in the
morning, and to collect its petals towards the centre about nine o'clock.
FORSTER1-1827-2,27.375

Linnaeus has enumerated forty-six flowers which possess this kind of
sensibility: FORSTER1-1827-2,27.376

he divides them into three classes.  1. Meteoric Flowers,
which less accurately observe the hour of folding, but are expanded
sooner or later, according to the cloudiness, moisture, or pressure of
the atmosphere.  2. Tropical Flowers, that open in the morning
and close before evening every day; but the hour of their expanding
becomes earlier or later as the length of the day increases or decreases.
3. Equinoctial Flowers, which open at a certain and exact hour
of the day, and for the most part close at another determinate hour.

<font> Forests.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,27.378

- The hollow sound of forests, while the wind is roaring among the woods,

<font> Frogs, <$$font> by their clamorous croaking, indicate rainy
weather; as does likewise their coming abroad in great numbers of an
evening; FORSTER1-1827-2,27.380

but this last sign applies more obviously to toads.
FORSTER1-1827-2,27.381

Virgil observes, as a sign of rain, {COM:latin_omitted}

FORSTER1-1827-2,28.386

There is something remarkable about the growth of fungi.
FORSTER1-1827-2,28.387

Some fungi appear here and there springing up in places where they
are least expected, and where they have perhaps never grown before.
FORSTER1-1827-2,28.388

How do the seeds come in such places?  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.389

A learned cryptogamist once said, he thought their semina floated in the
air, and were carried up into the clouds, and wafted along with them,
and deposited by fogs on the earth's surface.  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.390

Is there any particular aspect or side of trees more obnoxious to the
growth of parasitical fungi than others?  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.391

<font> Gales of Wind <$$font> are foretold by the sudden fall of
the mercury in the barometer, or the appearance of waneclouds and of
curlclouds, and by many of the signs of rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.392

Varying gales and changing breezes often indicate a change of weather
from fair to wet.  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.393

The most tremendous gales and storms have been foretold by the settling
of the stormy petrels under the wake of a ship.  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.394

<font> Gallinaceous Poultry <$$font> in general appear uneasy,
FORSTER1-1827-2,28.395

and rub in the dust, before rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.396

<font> Geese <$$font> washing, or taking wing with a clamorous noise,
and flying to the water, portend rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,28.397

Geese are excellent guards to a house against fire or thieves.
FORSTER1-1827-2,28.398

Hence Ovid, speaking of the former white colour of the crow, observes in
allusion to the geese who saved the Roman capital: {COM:latin_omitted}
FORSTER1-1827-2,28.399

When Wild Geese are observed to migrate to the southward or westward in
greater numbers than usual in autumn or winter, they are said to indicate
hard weather; FORSTER1-1827-2,28.400

and in general the early appearance <P_29> of flocks of these and other
wild fowls in the south, foreshew a severe winter.  FORSTER1-1827-2,29.401

<font> Gnats <$$font> afford several indications.  FORSTER1-1827-2,29.402

When they fly in a vortex in the beams of the setting sun, they forbode
fair weather: FORSTER1-1827-2,29.403

when they frisk about more widely in the open air at eventide, they
foreshew heat; FORSTER1-1827-2,29.404

and when they assemble under trees, and bite more than usual, they
indicate rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,29.405

<font> Gossamer, <$$font> as it is called, being the fine web of a certain
species of spiders, floating in the air in abundance, and lodging on the
trees, or the rigging of ships, and on other objects , affords a sign of
fine settled weather in autumn, as does the much covering of the ground
and herbage by the woof of the spiders in general.  FORSTER1-1827-2,29.406

See <font> Spider.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,29.407

In crossing the Channel from Calais to Dover, I have observed that the
captains of the vessels have sometimes forboded fine settled weather
from the settling on the masts and rigging, of a certain sort of web,
which we take to be the woof of some spider, though we have observed it
to alight on the ships when some way out at sea.  FORSTER1-1827-2,29.408

<font> Hail, Snow, and Sleet <$$font> have but few appropriate signs.
FORSTER1-1827-2,29.409

In general the clouds which are destined to pour the cool hailshowers
of a March or April day have more defined edges and a different
sort of appearance from those clouds which eventually lead to rain.
FORSTER1-1827-2,29.410

There is also a peculiar dark brownish purple colour in some of the
large twainclouds which precede the vernal showers of snow and hail.
FORSTER1-1827-2,29.411

<font> Halo.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,29.412

- When this phenomenon is observed round the sun or moon, it indicates
the presence of the wanecloud, FORSTER1-1827-2,29.413

and shews that hail, snow, or rain, according to the season, will
soon follow.  FORSTER1-1827-2,29.414

Coloured or double Halos are still more certain indications <P_30>
of rain, and often of wind also.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.415

When mock suns or mock moons, bands of light, and other unusual phenomena
attend Halos, a peculiar condition of the atmosphere is indicated.
FORSTER1-1827-2,30.416

The proper <font> Halo <$$font> or luminous ring, is distinguished
from the <font> Corona <$$font> or luminous disk, which is sometimes
a forerunner of rain also, but is a thing of more frequent occurrence.
FORSTER1-1827-2,30.417

When Halos are very red, wind almost always follows.
FORSTER1-1827-2,30.418

<font> Headaches <$$font> often foretell a change of weather in persons
subject to such complaints.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.419

There is also some obscure change of weather near to the periods of
new and full moon which causes a certain ephemeral headache that begins
usually in the morning, gets worse about two o'clock, and subsides in
the evening, attended with an irritated stomach; FORSTER1-1827-2,30.420

it much resembles the ordinary bilious headache from repletion,
FORSTER1-1827-2,30.421

but differs from that which follows immediately on a certain sort of
indigestion.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.422

Indeed most periodical disorders seem to be connected with some
atmospheric changes.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.423

And it is very remarkable, that they should so often have their worst
paroxysms and the crisis of their terms about the time of the conjunction
and the opposition of the moon.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.424

<font> Hogs, <$$font> when they shake the stalks of corn and spoil them,
often indicate rain: FORSTER1-1827-2,30.425

also when they rub in the dust, the same or some similar phenomenon may
be expected.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.426

When they run squeaking about, and throw up their heads with a peculiar
jerk, windy weather is about to commence: hence the Wiltshire proverb,
that"Pigs can see the wind. "FORSTER1-1827-2,30.427

<font> Horses, <$$font> as well as some other domestic animals, foretell
the coming of rain by starting more than ordinary, and appearing in
other respects restless and uneasy on the road.  FORSTER1-1827-2,30.428

It has been questioned <P_31> whether those animals do not manifest
also some periodical irritability, like that which influences mankind.
FORSTER1-1827-2,31.429

Possibly the eyes of certain horses, like that of certain persons, may be
attended with <font> muscae volitantes <$$font> or other imperfections
of sight which render their perceptions of objects less perfect before
rain; FORSTER1-1827-2,31.430

they may also become more generally irritable.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.431

The fact however is true, FORSTER1-1827-2,31.432

and has frequently come under our observation.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.433

<font> Hydrometers <$$font> indicate that the air is moist or dry,
FORSTER1-1827-2,31.434

and hence become prognosticks of rain, which often follows a general
dampness of the air.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.435

<font> Incubus <$$font> or Nightmare, though it commonly comes of a loaded
stomach, will nevertheless often occur on the occasion of a change of
weather in the night, which seem to produce the effect by disturbing
the digestive organs.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.436

The same observation holds good with regard to those frightful and
impressive dreams which some persons have in particular kinds of weather,
and about the period of change.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.437

An east wind beginning to blow in the night will often cause them;
FORSTER1-1827-2,31.438

and sometimes the same effect is produced by that state of the atmosphere
which immediately precedes a large fall of snow; though the latter
phenomenon more often produces dullness and languor of the whole animal
system of the body.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.439

<font> Jackdaws <$$font> are said to be more than usually clamorous
before rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.440

These birds frequent the flocks of rooks, FORSTER1-1827-2,31.441

and with them go out to feed, as if they were aware of the superior
sagacity of the rook in finding out the most productive pasture, and
had learnt to avail themselves of it.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.442

Starlings sometimes do the same.  FORSTER1-1827-2,31.443

Sometimes before a change of weather the daws make a great noise in the
chimneys wherein they build, FORSTER1-1827-2,31.444

and the sound coming down the flue is distinctly heard in the chamber.
FORSTER1-1827-2,31.445

<P_32>

<font> Ignis Fatuus, <$$font> Will with a Wisp, or Jack-a-Lantern, is
a kind of meteor which takes place near the ground, neither the cause
nor indicative value of which are quite agreed on.  FORSTER1-1827-2,32.447

Sir Isaac Newton calls it a vapour shining without heat,
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.448

and says that there is the same difference between this vapour and flame,
as between rotten wood shining without heat, and burning coals of fire.
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.449

The Ignis Fatuus is said to have been observed to stand still as well
as to move, FORSTER1-1827-2,32.450

and sometimes seemed fixed on the surface of the water.
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.451

In Italy two kinds of these lights are said to have been discovered;
one in the mountains, the other in the plains: FORSTER1-1827-2,32.452

they are called by the common people Cularsi, because they look upon
them as birds, the belly and other parts of which are resplendent like
the Pyraustae or Fire Flies.  FORSTER1-1827-2,32.453

Mr. Bradley supposed the Will with a Wisp to be no more than a
group of small enlightened insects.  FORSTER1-1827-2,32.454

Mr. Francis Willoughby and Mr. Ray were of opinion, that
the Ignis Fatuus is nothing but the shining of some night flying insect.
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.455

Dr. Derham, on the other hand, thought this phenomenon was composed
of fired vapours.  FORSTER1-1827-2,32.456

Various have been the conjectures of different philosophers about the
causes of these igneous meteors: FORSTER1-1827-2,32.457

their precise cause has, however, never been ascertained.
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.458

M. De Luc ascribes them to certain phosphoric exhalations, which
ascend from the earth, and take fire or become phosphorescent in the air.
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.459

Some have regarded the Ignis Fatuus to be an electrical phenomenon, while
most philosophers nowadays regard it as the combustion of some gases.
FORSTER1-1827-2,32.460

<P_33>

The following simile, founded on the popular superstition of the Ignis
Fatuus conducting its followers into dangerous situations, is taken from
"The Times Anatomised in several Characters,"by T. F.
12mo. Lond. 1647, Character 24th,"A Novice Preacher; "of
whom the author says,"No wonder that instead of shining lights they prove
<font> foolish fires to lead their flock into a maze of errours , <$$font>
in which they wander, not having the clue of learning or judgement to
guide them out. "Signat. E. I. - <font> Brand's
Pop. Antiq. <$$font> vol. ii. p. 682.
FORSTER1-1827-2,33.462

Milton, in his Paradise Lost, b. ix. l. 634,
observes: - {COM:verse_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,33.463

Some persons have confounded the Ignis Fatuus with the St. Elmo's
fires, called Castor and Pollux, and described in the Peren.
Calendar, Jan. 26, p. 32, to which, excepting their
difference of local situation, they seem to bear some analogy.
FORSTER1-1827-2,33.464

If one of these fires is seen alone the sailors call it Helen,
FORSTER1-1827-2,33.465

but the two they call Castor and Pollux, FORSTER1-1827-2,33.466

and invoke them as gods.  FORSTER1-1827-2,33.467

"These lights do sometimes about the evening rest on men's heads,
FORSTER1-1827-2,33.468

and are a great and good omen. "FORSTER1-1827-2,33.469

These appearances are called by the French and Spaniards inhabiting
the coasts of the Mediterranean St Helme's or St. Elme's Fires;
by the Italians the Fires of St. Peter and St. Nicholas,
FORSTER1-1827-2,33.470

and they are frequently taken notice of by the writers of voyages.
FORSTER1-1827-2,33.471

<P_34>

Thus in"Greene's Conceipt,"&c. 4to. Lond. 1598,
p. 27: - {COM:verse_omitted} FORSTER1-1827-2,34.473

<font> Jonquils, <$$font> of which there are several sorts, blow in the
open ground in March and April.  FORSTER1-1827-2,34.474

The Great Jonquil and the Odorous Jonquil blow about the middle of March.
The lesser or proper Jonquil somewhat later.  FORSTER1-1827-2,34.475

When they blow well and early they forbode a fine season.
FORSTER1-1827-2,34.476

<font> Kine, <$$font> when they assemble at one corner of a
field with their tails to windward, often indicate rain or wind.
FORSTER1-1827-2,34.477

During the dead calm before a storm comes up, we may often see them
extending their nostrils, and with the head upwards snuffing in the air;
FORSTER1-1827-2,34.478

this prognostic has been noticed of old by Virgil, and after him by Lord
Bacon and others.  FORSTER1-1827-2,34.479

{COM:latin_omitted}

Cattle are also said to foreshew rain when they lick their fore-feet,
or lie on the right side, or scratch themselves more than they are wont
to do against posts or other objects.  FORSTER1-1827-2,34.481

Some say oxen licking themselves against the hair is a sign of wet.
FORSTER1-1827-2,34.482

<font> Kingfishers.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,34.483

- These brilliant birds appear above ponds, rivers, and pieces of water
at uncertain times; FORSTER1-1827-2,34.484

the prognostics which Brown in his"Vulgar <P_35> Errours" pretends to have
drawn from these Birds seem quite foundationless.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.485

<font> Kites <$$font> made of paper, such as are usually flown
by boys, may be converted into useful prognosticks of the wind.
FORSTER1-1827-2,35.486

When several of them are let up together, the higher ones being
successively tied to the backsticks of those below them, they will ascend
to a vast height.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.487

We have known the upper kite in these cases ascend to above 1000 feet
high.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.488

When the upper one gets a direction different from the lower one, the
wind will frequently be found to get into the quarter indicated by the
upper kite.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.489

This law respecting winds is more strikingly manifested by means of
small air balloons, whose varying directions, as they ascend, portend
the successive changes of the wind, which often take place first in the
higher regions of the air.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.490

See <font> Balloon, Cloud, Current, <$$font> and <font> Wind.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,35.491

When by the motion of kites we perceive that the wind vibrates or
shifts its direction we may be sure the weather will be squally.
FORSTER1-1827-2,35.492

There is also a kind of bobbing motion sometimes imparted to kites by
the wind in variable weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.493

The kite seems to nod backwards and forward, thereby pulling
forward the arm of the person who holds it by successive jerks.
FORSTER1-1827-2,35.494

During many fine afternoons this present summer, when the wind has blown
strong, we have repeated all the above experiments, particularly on the
following days: - Sunday, July 11; Monday, July 12; Sunday, August 29;
and Thursday, Nov. 4.  FORSTER1-1827-2,35.495

<font> Kites.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,35.496

- The birds so called <font> Falcones Milvi <$$font> soaring very
high in the air, denote fair weather, according to many authors.
FORSTER1-1827-2,35.497

$The {TEXT:Th} same is observed of Ravens.  - <font> Corvi Coraces.
<$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,35.498

<P_36>

<font> Lamps, <$$font> from the manner in which they burn forbode weather.
FORSTER1-1827-2,36.500

Before rain they burn less bright, FORSTER1-1827-2,36.501

the flame snaps and crackles, FORSTER1-1827-2,36.502

and a sort of fungous excrescence grows from the wicks, which
Virgil was mindful to put among his prognostics of rain and wind.
FORSTER1-1827-2,36.503

See <font> Virgilian Prognostics.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,36.504

From this indicatorial property of the burning lights arose many
superstitions relating to them; as the blue colour of the flame
being a sign of ghosts, and death, and so on, of which the following
explanation is already offered in the <font> Perennial Calendar.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,36.505

Numerous were the omens attached by credulous persons, in former days,
to the manner in which candles burnt, and particularly to the colour of
their flames.  FORSTER1-1827-2,36.506

When they burned blue, it was accounted ill luck, or else that some
ghostly apparition was announced.  FORSTER1-1827-2,36.507

Now, when the brain and nervous system are in a certain state peculiarly
favourable to spectral illusions, the imagination may easily colour
the flame of a candle, without its really changing its tint: just as,
in fevers, people see spots of colour on the wall, or imagine insects
on the bed-clothes.  FORSTER1-1827-2,36.508

For the same morbid condition of the animal system, which may cause
persons to see the spectral prognostic, would, in this case, cause them
to behold the subsequent phantom, FORSTER1-1827-2,36.509

and thus the omen and its awful consequence would be viewed together to
the support of superstition.  FORSTER1-1827-2,36.510

Besides this, the particular mode of burning observed in the wicks
of lamps and candles, is really found to be caused by atmospherical
peculiarities, FORSTER1-1827-2,36.511

and is a sure sign of rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,36.512

From the same work we quote as follows: FORSTER1-1827-2,36.513

- Nov. 18.  FORSTER1-1827-2,36.514

This is, perhaps, the most foggy time of the whole year; a dense
stratus frequently continuing through the whole night and day.
FORSTER1-1827-2,36.515

Indeed, <P_37> fogs are the usual concomitants of November in London
and its neighbourhood, where one effect of a foggy night is often that
of diminishing the combustion of oil in lamps and other lights, which
shews that misty and damp air $can $not {TEXT:cannot} furnish oxygen so
readily as that which is clear.  FORSTER1-1827-2,37.516

We remember, frequently after foggy nights, seeing the lamps in the
street burning to a late hour next morning.  FORSTER1-1827-2,37.517

Experiments on the power of the air at different times to furnish
oxygen, might be made with Lamps, Candles, and other lights.
FORSTER1-1827-2,37.518

We find that fungous excrescences about the wicks of Lamps and
Candles have been regarded as signs of rain, time immemorial.
FORSTER1-1827-2,37.519

Aristophanes has an allusion to it: - {COM:greek_omitted}
FORSTER1-1827-2,37.520

Aratus speaks to the same effect: - {COM:greek_omitted} which Virgil
with his wonted elegance thus parodizes: - {COM:latin_omitted}
FORSTER1-1827-2,37.521

<font> Larks, <$$font> when they fly high, and remain singing a long
while in the air, forbode fine weather.  FORSTER1-1827-2,37.522

<font> Leaches <$$font> confined in a glass of water, by their <P_38>
motions foretell rain and wind, before which they seem much agitated,
particularly before thunder and lightning.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.523

<font> Lily.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,38.524

- The Lent Lily, or Daffodil, <font> Narcissus Pseudonarcissus, <$$font>
indicates the commencement of March, the Lily of the Valley the middle
of May, the Orange Lily the beginning of June, and the White Lily the
middle of July.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.525

By a familiar acquaintance with flowers we may know not only the coming
weather, but the time of day and the time of year.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.526

Linnaeus is said to have possessed such a knowledge of the periods
and indication of flowers, that he wanted neither a watch, a calendar,
nor a weatherglass.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.527

See <font> Lily, <$$font> in Part ii.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.528

<font> Lychnis.  <$$font> FORSTER1-1827-2,38.529

- This plant, usually called Scarlet Lychnis, blows regularly about the
24th of June, FORSTER1-1827-2,38.530

and is hence called <font> Candelabrum Sancti Johannis.  <$$font>
FORSTER1-1827-2,38.531

The appearance of its beautiful red flowers are sure indications that
the summer solstice is at hand: FORSTER1-1827-2,38.532

it blows through July, FORSTER1-1827-2,38.533

and fades in August.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.534

By an easy corruption it has got the vulgar name of Scarlet Lightning.
FORSTER1-1827-2,38.535

<font> Lumen Lambens <$$font> is an electric light, seen about plants of
a summer evening, of which the particular indications as to the coming
weather have not been yet accurately discovered.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.536

<font> Magpies, <$$font> in windy weather, fly often in small flocks of
three or four together, uttering a harsh cry.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.537

Horace's allusion, <font> {COM:latin_omitted} <$$font> seems to have
reference to some observed prognosticative sign, converted by augurs into
a superstitious fable, whereby these birds are represented as unlucky.
FORSTER1-1827-2,38.538

The absurd foreboding of ill luck from magpies is well known to the
vulgar and credulous.  FORSTER1-1827-2,38.539

<P_39>

<font> March Dust <$$font> and <font> May Sun, <$$font> both of which
imply a fine dry spring, are said to be particularly good omens for
the husbandman.  FORSTER1-1827-2,39.541

An adage says,"A peck of March dust is worth a king's ransom.
"FORSTER1-1827-2,39.542

We have confirmed, by many years'experience, the truth of the proverb
which commends a dry spring, as leading to the most productive summer.

The small Field Marigold, <font> Calendra arvensis, <$$font> affords a
more certain sign of rain when its flowers are closed in the morning.
FORSTER1-1827-2,39.546

Marigolds flower all the year, FORSTER1-1827-2,39.547

but are in greatest abundance in July and August.  FORSTER1-1827-2,39.548

<font> Mare's Tails, <$$font> or cormoid curlclouds in the sky, forbode
wind, and sometimes rain.  FORSTER1-1827-2,39.549

The Martins, or Martlets, as they are called in heraldry, arrive
a few days later than Swallows, that is, about the 20th of April,
FORSTER1-1827-2,39.552

and depart in October; previous to which they swarm in thousands, and
settle on the roofs of buildings.  FORSTER1-1827-2,39.553
