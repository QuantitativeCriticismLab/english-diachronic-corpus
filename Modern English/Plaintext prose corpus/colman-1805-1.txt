Act II.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.4

Scene I.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.5

<$$heading>

<font> A Library in the House of Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale;
COLMAN-1805-1,19.7

<font> Books scatter'd on a Writing-table.  <$$font> COLMAN-1805-1,19.8

<font> Enter <$$font> Tom Shuffleton, <font> and a Servant.  <$$font>
COLMAN-1805-1,19.9

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Nobody up yet?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.10

I thought so.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.11

<font> Enter <$$font> Servant.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.12

Ah, John, is it you?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.13

How $d'$ye {TEXT:d'ye} do, John?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.14

<font> John.  <$$font> Thank your honour, I - COLMAN-1805-1,19.15

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes, you look so.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.16

Sir Simon Rochdale in bed?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.17

Mr. Rochdale not risen?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.18

Well!  no matter: COLMAN-1805-1,19.19

I have travell'd all night, though, to be with them.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.20

How are they?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.21

<font> John.  <$$font> Sir, they are both - COLMAN-1805-1,19.22

<font> Shuff. <$$font> $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} glad to hear it.
COLMAN-1805-1,19.23

Pay the post-boy for me.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.24

<font> John.  <$$font> Yes, sir.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.25

I beg pardon, sir; COLMAN-1805-1,19.26

but when your honour last left us - COLMAN-1805-1,19.27

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Owed you three pound five.
COLMAN-1805-1,19.28

I remember: COLMAN-1805-1,19.29

have you down in my memorandums - COLMAN-1805-1,19.30

Honourable Tom Shuffleton debtor to - COLMAN-1805-1,19.31

- $What $'s {TEXT:What's} your name?  COLMAN-1805-1,19.32

<font> John.  <$$font> My Christian name, sir, is - <font> Shuff.
<$$font> Muggins - COLMAN-1805-1,19.33

I recollect.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.34

Pay the post-boy, Muggins.  COLMAN-1805-1,19.35

And, hark ye, take particular care of the chaise: COLMAN-1805-1,19.36

I borrow'd it of my friend, Bobby Fungus, who sprang up a peer, in the
last bundle <P_20> of Barons: COLMAN-1805-1,20.37

if a single knob is knock'd out of his new coronets, $he $'ll {TEXT:he'll}
make me a sharper speech than ever $he $'ll {TEXT:he'll} produce in
Parliament.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.38

And, John!  - COLMAN-1805-1,20.39

<font> John.  <$$font> Sir.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.40

<font> Shuff. <$$font> What was I going to say?
COLMAN-1805-1,20.41

<font> John.  <$$font> Indeed, sir, I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} tell.
COLMAN-1805-1,20.42

<font> Shuff. <$$font> No more can I.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.43

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} the fashion to be absent - COLMAN-1805-1,20.44

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} why I forgot your little bill.
COLMAN-1805-1,20.45

There, run along.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.46

<bracket> <font> Exit <$$font> John.  {TEXT:missing_close_bracket}
COLMAN-1805-1,20.47

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} the whirl of Bobby's chaise in my head still.
COLMAN-1805-1,20.48

Cursed fatiguing, posting all night, through Cornish roads, to obey the
summons of friendship!  COLMAN-1805-1,20.49

Convenient, in some respects, for all that.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.50

If all loungers of slender revenues, like mine, could command a
constant succession of invitations, from men of estates, in the
country, how amazingly it would tend to the thinning of Bond-street!

<$$font> <$$paren> COLMAN-1805-1,20.52

Let me see - what has Sir Simon been reading?  COLMAN-1805-1,20.53

-"Burn's Justice"- COLMAN-1805-1,20.54

true; the old $man $'s {TEXT:man's} reckon'd the ablest magistrate in
the county: COLMAN-1805-1,20.55

he $has $n't {TEXT:hasn't} cut open the leaves, I see.
COLMAN-1805-1,20.56

"Chesterfield's Letters"- COLMAN-1805-1,20.57

pooh!  his system of education is extinct: COLMAN-1805-1,20.58

Belcher and the Butcher have superseded it.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.59

"Clarendon's History of -. "COLMAN-1805-1,20.60

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.61

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Ah, my dear Tom Shuffleton!
COLMAN-1805-1,20.62

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Baronet!  how are you?  COLMAN-1805-1,20.63

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Such expedition is kind, now!
COLMAN-1805-1,20.64

You got my letter at Bath, COLMAN-1805-1,20.65

and - <font> Shuff. <$$font> Saw it was pressing:
COLMAN-1805-1,20.66

- here I am.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.67

Cut all my engagements for you, COLMAN-1805-1,20.68

and came off like a shot.  COLMAN-1805-1,20.69

<font> Sir Simon <$$font> Thank you: COLMAN-1805-1,20.70

thank you, heartily!  COLMAN-1805-1,20.71

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Left every thing at sixes and sevens.
COLMAN-1805-1,20.72

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Gad, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sorry if -
COLMAN-1805-1,20.73

<P_21>

<font> Shuff. <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} apologize;
COLMAN-1805-1,21.75

- nobody does, now.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.76

Left all my bills, in the place, unpaid.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.77

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Bless me!  COLMAN-1805-1,21.78

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} made it monstrous inconvenient!  COLMAN-1805-1,21.79

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Not a bit - COLMAN-1805-1,21.80

I give you my honour, COLMAN-1805-1,21.81

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} find it inconvenient, at all.
COLMAN-1805-1,21.82

How is Frank Rochdale?  COLMAN-1805-1,21.83

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Why, my son $is $n't {TEXT:isn't} up yet;
COLMAN-1805-1,21.84

and, before $he $'s {TEXT:he's} stirring, do let me talk to you, my dear
Tom Shuffleton!  COLMAN-1805-1,21.85

I have something near my heart, that - COLMAN-1805-1,21.86

<font> Shuff. <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} talk about your heart,
Baronet; COLMAN-1805-1,21.87

- $feeling $'s {TEXT:feeling's} quite out of fashion.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.88

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Well, then, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} interested in
- COLMAN-1805-1,21.89

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Aye, stick to that.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.90

We make a joke of the heart, now-a-days; COLMAN-1805-1,21.91

but when a man mentions his interest, we know $he $'s {TEXT:he's}
in earnest.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.92

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Zounds!  COLMAN-1805-1,21.93

I <font> am <$$font> in earnest.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.94

Let me speak, COLMAN-1805-1,21.95

and call my motives what you will.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.96

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Speak - COLMAN-1805-1,21.97

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} be in a passion.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.98

We are always cool at the clubs: COLMAN-1805-1,21.99

the constant habit of ruining one another, teaches us temper.
COLMAN-1805-1,21.100

Explain.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.101

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Well, I will.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.102

You know, my dear Tom, how much I admire your proficiency in the <font>
New School <$$font> of breeding; COLMAN-1805-1,21.103

- you are, what I call, one of the highest finish'd fellows, of the <font>
present day.  <$$font> COLMAN-1805-1,21.104

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Psha!  Baronet; you flatter.
COLMAN-1805-1,21.105

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> No, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't};
COLMAN-1805-1,21.106

only in extolling the merits of the newest-fashion'd manners and morals ,
I am sometimes puzzled, by the plain gentlemen, who listen to me, here
in the country, most consumedly.  COLMAN-1805-1,21.107

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} doubt it.
COLMAN-1805-1,21.108

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Why, $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} but t'other
morning, I was haranguing old Sir Noah Starchington, in my library,
and explaining to him the shining qualities <P_22> of a dasher, of the
year eighteen hundred and three; COLMAN-1805-1,22.109

and what do you think he did?  COLMAN-1805-1,22.110

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Fell asleep.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.111

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> No; COLMAN-1805-1,22.112

he pull'd down an English dictionary; when <paren> if $you $'ll
{TEXT:you'll} believe me!  <$$paren> he found my definition of stylish
living, under the word"insolvency;"COLMAN-1805-1,22.113

a fighting crop turn'd out a"dock'd bull-dog;"and modern gallantry,
"adultery and seduction. "COLMAN-1805-1,22.114

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Noah Starchington is a damn'd old twaddler.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.115

- But the fact is, Baronet, we improve.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.116

We have voted many qualities to be virtues, now, that they never thought
of calling virtues formerly.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.117

The rising generation wants a new dictionary, damnably.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.118

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Deplorably indeed.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.119

You $can $n't {TEXT:can't} think, my dear Tom, what a scurvy figure
you, and the dashing fellows of your kidney, make in the old ones.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.120

- But you have great influence over my son, Frank; COLMAN-1805-1,22.121

and I want you to exert it.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.122

You are his intimate - COLMAN-1805-1,22.123

you come here, COLMAN-1805-1,22.124

and pass two or three months at a time, you know.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.125

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes - this is a pleasant house.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.126

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> You ride his horses, as if they were your own.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.127

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes - he keeps a good stable.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.128

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> You drink our claret with him, till his
head aches.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.129

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yours is a famous claret, Baronet.
COLMAN-1805-1,22.130

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> You worm out his secrets; COLMAN-1805-1,22.131

you win his money; COLMAN-1805-1,22.132

you -.  In short, you are - <font> Shuff. <$$font> His friend,
according to the next new dictionary.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.133

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} what you mean, Sir Simon.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.134

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Exactly.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.135

- But, let me explain.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.136

Frank, if he $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} play the fool, and spoil all,
is going to be married.  COLMAN-1805-1,22.137

<font> Shuff. <$$font> To how much?  COLMAN-1805-1,22.138

<P_23>

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Damn it, COLMAN-1805-1,23.140

now, how like a modern man of the world that is!  COLMAN-1805-1,23.141

Formerly, they would have ask'd to <font> who <$$font>.
COLMAN-1805-1,23.142

<font> Shuff. <$$font> We never do, now; COLMAN-1805-1,23.143

- $fortune $'s {TEXT:fortune's} every thing.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.144

We say"a good match,"at the west end of the town, as they say" a good
man,"in the city; COLMAN-1805-1,23.145

- the phrase refers merely to money.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.146

Is she rich?  COLMAN-1805-1,23.147

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Four thousand a year.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.148

<font> Shuff. <$$font> What a devilish desirable woman!
COLMAN-1805-1,23.149

$Frank $'s {TEXT:Frank's} a happy dog!  COLMAN-1805-1,23.150

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> $He $'s {TEXT:He's} a miserable puppy.
COLMAN-1805-1,23.151

He has no more notion, my dear Tom, of a modern"good match," than Eve
had of pin-money.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.152

<font> Shuff. <$$font> What are his objections to it?
COLMAN-1805-1,23.153

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> I have smoked'im; COLMAN-1805-1,23.154

but he $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} know that; COLMAN-1805-1,23.155

- a filly, sly amour, in another quarter.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.156

<font> Shuff. <$$font> An amour!  COLMAN-1805-1,23.157

$That $'s {TEXT:That's} a very unfashionable reason for declining
matrimony.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.158

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> You know his romantick flights.
COLMAN-1805-1,23.159

The blockhead, I believe, is so attach'd, I $shou'd $n't {TEXT:shou'dn't}
wonder if he flew off at a tangent, and married the girl that has
bewitch'd him.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.160

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Who is she?  COLMAN-1805-1,23.161

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> She - hem!  - she lives with her father,
in Penzance.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.162

<font> Shuff. <$$font> And who is <font> he <$$font>?
COLMAN-1805-1,23.163

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> He - upon my soul, I am ashamed to tell you.
COLMAN-1805-1,23.164

<font> Shuff. <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} be asham'd;
COLMAN-1805-1,23.165

we never blush at any thing, in the New School.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.166

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Damn me, my dear Tom, if he $is $n't
{TEXT:isn't} a brazier.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.167

<font> Shuff. <$$font> The devil!  COLMAN-1805-1,23.168

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> A dealer in kitchen candlesticks, coal
skuttles, coppers, and cauldrons.  COLMAN-1805-1,23.169

<font> Shuff. <$$font> And is the girl pretty?
COLMAN-1805-1,23.170

<P_24>

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> So they tell me; - a plump little devil,
as round as a tea kettle.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.172

<font> Shuff. <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be after the brazier's
daughter, to-morrow.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.173

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> But you have weight with him.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.174

Talk to him, my dear Tom - COLMAN-1805-1,24.175

reason with him; COLMAN-1805-1,24.176

try your powers, Tom, COLMAN-1805-1,24.177

do!  COLMAN-1805-1,24.178

<font> Shuff. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} much like plotting
with the father against the son - COLMAN-1805-1,24.179

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} reversing the New School, Baronet.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.180

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> But it will serve Frank: COLMAN-1805-1,24.181

it will serve <font> me <$$font>, who wish to serve <font> you.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.182

<font> And to prove that I do wish it, I have been keeping something
in embryo for you, my dear Tom Shuffleton, against your arrival.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.183

<font> Shuff. <$$font> For me?  COLMAN-1805-1,24.184

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> When you were last leaving us, if you
recollect, you mention'd, in a kind of a way, a - a sort of intention
of a loan, of an odd five hundred pounds.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.185

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Did I?  COLMAN-1805-1,24.186

I believe I might.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.187

- When I intend to raise money, I always give my friends the preference.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.188

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> I told you I was out of cash, then,
I remember.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.189

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Yes; $that $'s {TEXT:that's} just what I
told you, I remember.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.190

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> I have the sum floating by me, now,
COLMAN-1805-1,24.191

and much at your service <paren> <font> presenting it <$$font> <$$paren>.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.192

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Why, as $it $'s {TEXT:it's} lying idle,
Baronet, I - I - $do $n't {TEXT:don't} much care if I employ it <paren>
<font> taking it <$$font> <$$paren>.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.193

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Use your interest with Frank, now.
COLMAN-1805-1,24.194

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Rely on me.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.195

- Shall I give you my note?  COLMAN-1805-1,24.196

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> No, my dear Tom; $that $'s {TEXT:that's}
an unnecessary trouble.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.197

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Why, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} true - with
one who knows me so well as you.  COLMAN-1805-1,24.198

<P_25>

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Your verbal promise to pay, is quite as good.
COLMAN-1805-1,25.200

COLMAN-1805-1,25.201

Eh?  COLMAN-1805-1,25.204

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Pray, do you employ the phrase," verbal
promise to pay,"according to the reading of old dictionaries , or as $it
$'s {TEXT:it's} the fashion to use it at present.  COLMAN-1805-1,25.205

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Oh, damn it, COLMAN-1805-1,25.206

<font> Frank.  <$$font> She writes, you see, that she has abruptly left
her father - COLMAN-1805-1,33.457

Oh, Tom!  this business has unhinged me for society.  COLMAN-1805-1,33.464

Rigid morality, after all, is the best coat of mail for the conscience.
COLMAN-1805-1,33.465

<font> Shuff. <$$font> Our ancestors, who wore mail, admired it
amazingly; COLMAN-1805-1,33.466

but to mix in the gay world, with their rigid morality, would
be as singular as stalking into a drawing room, in their armour;
COLMAN-1805-1,33.467

- for dissipation is, now, the fashionable habit, with which, like
a brown coat, a man goes into company, to avoid being stared at.

my daughter has run another, and broke my -.  COLMAN-1805-1,34.484

<font> Bur.  <$$font> Well, but, master - COLMAN-1805-1,34.487

<font> Job.  <$$font> And reason told me to take you into my shop, when
the fat churchwardens starved you at the workhouse, COLMAN-1805-1,34.488

- damn their want of feeling for it!  COLMAN-1805-1,34.489

- and you were thump'd about, a poor, unoffending, ragged-rump'd boy,

<font> Bur.  <$$font> $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} say one cutting thing after

COLMAN-1805-1,34.501

Let them look at my ledger - $they $'ll {TEXT:they'll} find it right.
COLMAN-1805-1,34.502

I began upon a little; COLMAN-1805-1,34.503

I made that little great, by industry; COLMAN-1805-1,34.504

I never cringed to a customer, to get him into my books, that I might
hamper him with an overcharged bill, for long credit; COLMAN-1805-1,34.505

I earn'd my fair profits; COLMAN-1805-1,34.506

I paid my fair way; COLMAN-1805-1,34.507

I break by the treachery of a friend, COLMAN-1805-1,34.508

and my first dividend will be seventeen shillings in the pound.
COLMAN-1805-1,34.509

I wish every tradesman in England may clap his hand on his heart,

COLMAN-1805-1,38.636

and, destitute of friends, money, and food, was making his way to the next

<font> Pereg. <$$font> You may remember, too, when the boy

COLMAN-1805-1,38.640

They were the first earnings of your trade, you told him,
COLMAN-1805-1,38.641

and could not be laid out to better advantage than in relieving a helpless
orphan; COLMAN-1805-1,38.642

- and, giving him a letter of recommendation to a sea captain at Falmouth
, you wish'd him good spirits, and prosperity.  COLMAN-1805-1,38.643

He left you with a promise, that, if fortune ever smiled upon him,
you should, one day, hear news of Peregrine.  COLMAN-1805-1,38.644

<font> Job.  <$$font> Ah, poor fellow!  poor Peregrine!  he was a
pretty boy.  COLMAN-1805-1,38.645

I should like to hear news of him, I own.  COLMAN-1805-1,38.646

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I am that Peregrine.  COLMAN-1805-1,38.647

<font> Job.  <$$font> Eh?  what - you are -?  COLMAN-1805-1,38.648

No: let me <P_39> look at you again.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.649

Are you the pretty boy, that - COLMAN-1805-1,39.650

bless us, COLMAN-1805-1,39.651

how you are alter'd!  COLMAN-1805-1,39.652

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I have endured many hardships, since I
saw you; many turns of fortune; COLMAN-1805-1,39.653

- but, I deceived you <paren> it was the cunning of a truant lad <$$paren>
when I told you I had lost my parents.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.654

From a romantick folly, the growth of boyish brains, I had fix'd my
fancy on being a sailor, COLMAN-1805-1,39.655

and had run away from my father.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.656

<font> Job.  <$$font> <paren> <font> with great emotion.  <$$font>
<$$paren> Run away from your father!  COLMAN-1805-1,39.657

If I had known that, $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} have horsewhipp'd you, within an
inch of your life!  COLMAN-1805-1,39.658

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Had you known it, you had done right,
perhaps.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.659

<font> Job.  <$$font> Right?  COLMAN-1805-1,39.660

Ah!  you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what it is for a child to run away
from a father!  COLMAN-1805-1,39.661

Rot me, if I $wou'd $n't {TEXT:wou'dn't} have sent you back to him, tied,
neck and heels, in the basket of the stage coach.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.662

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I have had my compunctions;
COLMAN-1805-1,39.663

- have express'd them by letter to my father: COLMAN-1805-1,39.664

but I fear my penitence had no effect.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.665

<font> Job.  <$$font> Served you right.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.666

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Having no answers from him, he died, I
fear, without forgiving me <paren> <font> sighing <$$font> <$$paren>.
COLMAN-1805-1,39.667

<font> Job.  <$$font> <paren> <font> starting.  <$$font> <$$paren> What!
died!  without forgiving his child!  COLMAN-1805-1,39.668

- Come, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} too much.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.669

I $cou'd $n't {TEXT:cou'dn't} have done that, neither.
COLMAN-1805-1,39.670

- But, go on: COLMAN-1805-1,39.671

I hope $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} been prosperous.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.672

But you $shou'd $n't {TEXT:shou'dn't} - you $shou'd $n't {TEXT:shou'dn't}
have quitted your father.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.673

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I acknowledge it; COLMAN-1805-1,39.674

- yet, I have seen prosperity; though I traversed many countries, on my
outset, in pain and poverty.  COLMAN-1805-1,39.675

Chance, at length, raised me a friend in India; by whose interest, and my
own industry, I amass'd considerable wealth, in the Factory at Calcutta.
COLMAN-1805-1,39.676

<font> Job.  <$$font> And have just landed it, I suppose, in England?
COLMAN-1805-1,39.677

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I landed one hundred pounds, last night,
<P_40> in my purse, as I swam from the Indiaman, which was splitting on
a rock, half a league from the neighbouring shore.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.678

As for the rest of my property - bills, bonds, cash, jewels - the whole
amount of my toil and application, are, by this time, I doubt not,
gone to the bottom; COLMAN-1805-1,40.679

and Peregrine is return'd, after thirty years, to pay his debt to you,
almost as poor as he left you.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.680

<font> Job.  <$$font> I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} touch a penny of your
hundred pounds - not a penny.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.681

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I do not desire you: COLMAN-1805-1,40.682

I only desire you to take your own.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.683

<font> Job.  <$$font> My own?  COLMAN-1805-1,40.684

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Yes; I plunged with this box, last night,
into the waves.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.685

You see, it has your name on it.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.686

<font> Job.  <$$font>"Job Thornberry,"sure enough.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.687

And $what $'s {TEXT:what's} in it?  COLMAN-1805-1,40.688

<font> Pereg. <$$font> The harvest of a kind man's charity;
- the produce of your bounty, to one whom you thought an orphan.
COLMAN-1805-1,40.689

I have traded, these twenty years, on ten guineas <paren> which, from
the first, I had set apart as yours <$$paren>, till they have become
ten thousand: COLMAN-1805-1,40.690

take it; COLMAN-1805-1,40.691

it could not, I find, come more opportunely.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.692

Your honest heart gratified itself in administering to my need;
COLMAN-1805-1,40.693

and I experience that burst of pleasure, a grateful man enjoys,
in relieving my reliever <paren> <font> giving him the box <$$font>
<$$paren>.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.694

<font> Job.  <$$font> <paren> <font> squeezes <$$font> Peregrine's <font>
hand, COLMAN-1805-1,40.695

returns the box, COLMAN-1805-1,40.696

and seems almost unable to utter.  <$$font> <$$paren> Take it again.
COLMAN-1805-1,40.697

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Why do you reject it?  COLMAN-1805-1,40.698

<font> Job.  <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you, as soon as $I $'m
{TEXT:I'm} able.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.699

T'other day, I lent a friend - COLMAN-1805-1,40.700

Pshaw, rot it!  COLMAN-1805-1,40.701

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} an old fool!  <paren> <font> wiping his eyes.  <$$font>
<$$paren> COLMAN-1805-1,40.702

- I lent a friend, t'other day, the whole profits of my trade, to save
him from sinking.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.703

He walk'd off with them, COLMAN-1805-1,40.704

and made me a bankrupt.  COLMAN-1805-1,40.705

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} you think he is a rascal?  COLMAN-1805-1,40.706

<P_41>

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Decidedly so.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.708

<font> Job.  <$$font> And what should I be, if I took all you have saved
in the world, and left you to shift for yourself?  COLMAN-1805-1,41.709

<font> Pereg. <$$font> But the case is different.
COLMAN-1805-1,41.710

This money is, in fact, your own.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.711

I am inured to hardships; better able to bear them, COLMAN-1805-1,41.712

and am younger than you.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.713

Perhaps, too, I still have prospects of - COLMAN-1805-1,41.714

<font> Job.  <$$font> I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} take it.
COLMAN-1805-1,41.715

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} as thankful to you, as if I left you to starve:
COLMAN-1805-1,41.716

but I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} take it.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.717

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Remember, too, you have claims upon you,
which I have not.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.718

My guide, as I came hither, said, you had married in my absence:
COLMAN-1805-1,41.719

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} true, he told me, you were, now, a widower;
COLMAN-1805-1,41.720

but, it seems, you have a daughter to provide for.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.721

<font> Job.  <$$font> I have no daughter to provide for, now!
COLMAN-1805-1,41.722

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Then, he misinform'd me.
COLMAN-1805-1,41.723

<font> Job.  <$$font> No, he $did $n't {TEXT:didn't}.
COLMAN-1805-1,41.724

I had one, last night; COLMAN-1805-1,41.725

but $she $'s {TEXT:she's} gone.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.726

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Gone!  COLMAN-1805-1,41.727

<font> Job.  <$$font> Yes; gone to sea, for what I know, as you did.
COLMAN-1805-1,41.728

Run away from a good father, as you did.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.729

This is a morning to remember; COLMAN-1805-1,41.730

- my daughter has run out, COLMAN-1805-1,41.731

and the bailiffs have run in; COLMAN-1805-1,41.732

- I $sha $n't {TEXT:sha'n't} soon forget the day of the month.
COLMAN-1805-1,41.733

<font> Pereg. <$$font> This morning, did you say?
COLMAN-1805-1,41.734

<font> Job.  <$$font> Aye, before day-break; - a hard-hearted, base -
COLMAN-1805-1,41.735

<font> Pereg. <$$font> And could she leave you, during the
derangement of your affairs?  COLMAN-1805-1,41.736

<font> Job.  <$$font> She $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} know what was going
to happen, poor soul!  COLMAN-1805-1,41.737

I wish she had, now.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.738

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think my Mary would have left her old father in
the midst of his misfortunes.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.739

<font> Pereg. <$$font> <paren> <font> aside.  <$$font> <$$paren>
Mary!  it must be she!  COLMAN-1805-1,41.740

What is the amount of the demands upon you?  COLMAN-1805-1,41.741

<font> Job.  <font> Six thousand.  COLMAN-1805-1,41.742

But I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind that: COLMAN-1805-1,41.743

the goods can nearly cover it - COLMAN-1805-1,41.744

let'em take'em - COLMAN-1805-1,41.745

<P_42>

damn the gridirons and warming-pans!  COLMAN-1805-1,42.747

I could begin again - COLMAN-1805-1,42.748

but, now my $Mary $'s {TEXT:Mary's} gone, I $hav'$n't {TEXT:hav'n't}
the heart; COLMAN-1805-1,42.749

but I shall hit upon something.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.750

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Let me make a proposal to you, my old
friend.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.751

Permit me to settle with the officers, and to clear all demands upon you.
COLMAN-1805-1,42.752

Make it a debt, if you please.  I will have a hold, if it must be so,
on your future profits in trade; COLMAN-1805-1,42.753

- but do this, and I promise to restore your daughter to you.
COLMAN-1805-1,42.754

<font> Job.  <$$font> What?  bring back my child!  COLMAN-1805-1,42.755

Do you know where she is?  COLMAN-1805-1,42.756

Is she safe?  COLMAN-1805-1,42.757

Is she far off?  COLMAN-1805-1,42.758

Is - COLMAN-1805-1,42.759

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Will you receive the money?
COLMAN-1805-1,42.760

<font> Job.  <$$font> Yes, yes; on those terms - on those conditions.
COLMAN-1805-1,42.761

But, where is Mary?  COLMAN-1805-1,42.762

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Patience.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.763

I must not tell you yet; COLMAN-1805-1,42.764

but, in four-and-twenty hours, I pledge myself to bring her back to you.
COLMAN-1805-1,42.765

<font> Job.  <$$font> What, here?  to her father's house?
COLMAN-1805-1,42.766

and safe?  COLMAN-1805-1,42.767

Oh,'sbud!  when I see her safe, what a thundering passion $I $'ll
{TEXT:I'll} be in with her!  COLMAN-1805-1,42.768

But you are not deceiving me?  COLMAN-1805-1,42.769

You know, the first time you came into my shop, what a bouncer you told
me, when you were a boy.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.770

<font> Pereg. <$$font> Believe me, I would not trifle with you,
now.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.771

Come, come down to your shop, that we may rid it of its present visitants.
COLMAN-1805-1,42.772

<font> Job.  <$$font> I believe you dropt from the clouds, all on a
sudden, to comfort an old, broken-hearted brazier.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.773

<font> Pereg. <$$font> I rejoice, my honest friend, that I arrived
at so critical a juncture; COLMAN-1805-1,42.774

and, if the hand of Providence be in it, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} because
Heaven ordains that benevolent actions, like yours, sooner or later,
must ever meet their recompence.  COLMAN-1805-1,42.775

<font> Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale's <font> Library.  <$$font>
COLMAN-1805-1,43.785

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Simon Rochdale, <font> and the Earl of <$$font>
Fitz Balaam.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.786

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Believe me, my Lord, the man I wish'd
most to meet in my library this morning, was the Earl of Fitz Balaam.
COLMAN-1805-1,43.787

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> Thank you, Sir Simon.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.788

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Your arrival, a day before your promise,
gives us such convenient leisure to talk over the arrangements, relative
to the marriage of Lady Caroline Braymore, your lordship's daughter,
with my son.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.789

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> True, Sir Simon.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.790

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Then, while Lady Caroline is at her toilet,
$we $'ll {TEXT:we'll} dash into business at once; COLMAN-1805-1,43.791

for I know your lordship is a man of few words.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.792

They tell me, my lord, you have sat in the Upper House, and said nothing
but aye and no, there, for these thirty years.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.793

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> I spoke, for more than a minute, in the year
of the Influenza.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.794

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Bless me!  the epidemic, perhaps, raging
among the members, at the moment.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.795

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> Yes; COLMAN-1805-1,43.796

- they cough'd so loud, I left off in the middle.  COLMAN-1805-1,43.797

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> And you never attempted again?
COLMAN-1805-1,43.798

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> I hate to talk much, Sir Simon;
COLMAN-1805-1,43.799

- $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} my way; tho'several $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like it.
COLMAN-1805-1,43.800

<P_44>

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> I do.  COLMAN-1805-1,44.802

I consider it as a mark of your lordship's discretion.
COLMAN-1805-1,44.803

The less you say, my lord, in my mind, the wiser you are;
COLMAN-1805-1,44.804

and I have often thought it a pity, that some noble orators $hav'$n't
{TEXT:hav'n't} follow'd your lordship's example.  COLMAN-1805-1,44.805

- But, here are the writings <paren> <font> sitting down with Lord
<$$font> Fitz Balaam, <font> and taking them from the table <$$font>
<$$paren>.  COLMAN-1805-1,44.806

We must wave ceremony now, my lord; COLMAN-1805-1,44.807

for all this pile of parchment is built on the independent four thousand
a year of your daughter, Lady Caroline, on one hand, and your lordship's
incumbrances, on the other.  COLMAN-1805-1,44.808

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> I have saddles on my property, Sir Simon.
<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Which saddles, your lordship's property
being uncommonly small, look something like sixteen stone upon a poney.
COLMAN-1805-1,44.809

The Fitz Balaam estate, for an earl, is deplorably narrow!
COLMAN-1805-1,44.810

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> Yet, it has given security for a large debt.
COLMAN-1805-1,44.811

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Large, indeed!  COLMAN-1805-1,44.812

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} think how you have contriv'd it.
COLMAN-1805-1,44.813

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} the Archbishop of Brobdignag, squeez'd into Tom
Thumb's pantaloons.  COLMAN-1805-1,44.814

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> Mine is the oldest estate in England,
Sir Simon.  COLMAN-1805-1,44.815

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> If we may judge of age by decay, my lord,
it must be very ancient, indeed!  COLMAN-1805-1,44.816

- But this goes to something in the shape of supplies <paren> <font>
untying the papers <$$font> <$$paren>: COLMAN-1805-1,44.817

"Covenant between Augustus Julius Braymore, Earl of Fitz Balaam
, of Cullender Castle, in the county of Cumberland, and Simon
Rochdale, baronet, of Hollyhock-house, in the county of Cornwall.
"COLMAN-1805-1,44.818

- By the bye, my lord, considering what an expence attends that
castle, which is at your own disposal, and that, if the auctioneer
$do $n't {TEXT:don't} soon knock it <P_45> down, the weather will,
I wonder what has prevented your lordship's bringing it to the hammer.
COLMAN-1805-1,45.819

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> The dignity of my ancestors.
COLMAN-1805-1,45.820

I have blood in my family, Sir Simon <paren> <font> proudly <$$font>
<$$paren>.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.821

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> A deal of excellent blood, my lord;
COLMAN-1805-1,45.822

but, from the butler down to the house-dog, curse me if ever I saw so
little flesh in a family before.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.823

- But, by this covenant - <font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> You clear off the
largest mortgage.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.824

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Right; - for which purpose, on the day of
the young folks'marriage - <font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> You must pay me
forty thousand pounds.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.825

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Right, again.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.826

Your lordship says little; COLMAN-1805-1,45.827

but $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} terribly plump to the point, indeed, my lord.
COLMAN-1805-1,45.828

Here is the covenant; COLMAN-1805-1,45.829

- and, now, will your lordship look over the marriage articles?
COLMAN-1805-1,45.830

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> My attorney will be here to-morrow, Sir Simon.
COLMAN-1805-1,45.831

I prefer reading by deputy COLMAN-1805-1,45.832

<paren> <font> both rise <$$font> <$$paren>.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.833

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Many people of rank read in the same way,
my lord.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.834

And your lordship will receive the forty thousand pounds, I am to pay you,
by deputy also, I suppose.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.835

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> I seldom swear, Sir Simon;
COLMAN-1805-1,45.836

but, damn me if I will.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.837

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> I believe you are right.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.838

Yet there are but two reasons for not trusting an attorney with your
money: COLMAN-1805-1,45.839

- one is, when you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know him very well;
COLMAN-1805-1,45.840

and the other is, when you do.  COLMAN-1805-1,45.841

- And now, since the marriage is concluded, as I may say, in the families,
may I take the liberty to ask, my lord, what sort of a wife my son Frank
may expect in Lady Caroline?  COLMAN-1805-1,45.842

Frank is rather of a grave, domestick turn: COLMAN-1805-1,45.843

Lady Caroline, it seems, has past the three last winters in London.
COLMAN-1805-1,45.844

Did her ladyship enter into <font> all <$$font> the spirit of the first
circles?  COLMAN-1805-1,45.845

<P_46>

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> She was as gay as a lark, Sir Simon.
COLMAN-1805-1,46.847

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> Was she like the lark in her hours, my lord?
COLMAN-1805-1,46.848

<font> Lord Fitz.  <$$font> A great deal more like the owl, Sir Simon.
COLMAN-1805-1,46.849

<font> Sir Simon.  <$$font> I thought so.  COLMAN-1805-1,46.850

Had you come to me, almost broken-hearted, and not looking like one quite
