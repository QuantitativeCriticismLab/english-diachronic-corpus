His Education.  - Religion.  - Witchcraft.  - Government.  - Code Moral.
READE-1863-1,204.6

Among the natives of Equatorial Africa one finds as little variety as
among its features and natural productions.  READE-1863-1,204.7

There appears to me to be no difference between the Mpongwe, Benga,
Bakali, Shekani, etc., except such as can be attributed to
circumstance and climate.  READE-1863-1,204.8

Their strength, stature, complexion, manners, and dialects are modified
by their locality, their food, their isolation from their fellows,
and their intercourse with white men.  READE-1863-1,204.9

The dialect of a great city is usually more soft than that of a provincial
town; the latter less harsh and rugged than the scarcely intelligible
sounds which one hears in remote mining or agricultural districts.
READE-1863-1,204.10

The court lady is tall and elegant; her skin smooth and transparent;
READE-1863-1,204.11

her beauty has stamina and longevity.  READE-1863-1,204.12

The girl of the middle classes, so frequently pretty, is very often
short and coarse, READE-1863-1,204.13

and soon becomes a matron; while, if you descend to the lower classes ,
you will find good looks rare, and the figure angular, stunted, sometimes
almost deformed.  READE-1863-1,204.14

The Mpongwe, with their melodious dialect, their courteous manners,
and their graceful forms, inhabit Gaboon, the metropolis of <font>
Equatorial Africa.  <$$font> READE-1863-1,204.15

Securing the best situations on the rivers, they laugh at the poor Bushmen
who plant their villages so far from these high-roads of commerce ,
and who, with their guttural tongue and their degraded appearance,
are the rustics of the country.  READE-1863-1,204.16

The Benga of Corisco and the Commi of the Fernand Vaz form the
middle-class link between the two.  READE-1863-1,204.17

The Fans would appear to be the exceptional race, and to have descended
from the north; while the others, as far as I could learn, had originally
migrated from the south.  READE-1863-1,204.18

In their manners and customs the Fans do not appear to differ much from
the rest: READE-1863-1,204.19

like them, they are circumcised; READE-1863-1,204.20

like them, the women wear brass rings on their legs and beads in their
hair.  READE-1863-1,204.21

But their appearance, <P_205> with their light complexions and
rabbit-mouths, is peculiar; READE-1863-1,205.22

and when I first entered a Fula village, I was much struck by the
resemblance of the races.  READE-1863-1,205.23

They have a metal currency similar to that which is used on the Niger;
READE-1863-1,205.24

their method of killing elephants I have already proved by Leo Africanus
to have been practiced in Nigritia; READE-1863-1,205.25

and it seems to me extremely probable that these Fans are an offshoot
of that powerful race who have extended their conquests over so great
a part of Africa.  READE-1863-1,205.26

I shall now attempt to describe the real existence of the savage; his
progress from the womb to the grave; the woman whom he rules; the laws
which he obeys, and the gods whom he worships.  READE-1863-1,205.27

If a negro of Equatorial Africa possessed an entailed estate, and
detested his heir-at-law, he could not wish more earnestly for children.
READE-1863-1,205.28

Owing to the evil climate of this country, to the poor food and
vicious habits of its people, propagation is a perfect struggle;
READE-1863-1,205.29

polygamy becomes a law of nature; READE-1863-1,205.30

and even with the aid of this institution, so favorable to reproduction,
there are fewer children than wives.  READE-1863-1,205.31

The child is introduced into the world without medical assistance,
READE-1863-1,205.32

and is cordially welcomed.  READE-1863-1,205.33

It is rubbed every day with palm-oil, especially on its neck, back,
and loins.  READE-1863-1,205.34

The mother is treated with great respect, READE-1863-1,205.35

and is exempt from all labor while she continues to suckle her child,
which she continues to do while her milk lasts - generally two or three
years: READE-1863-1,205.36

I have seen a child tall enough to take the breast standing by its
mother's side; READE-1863-1,205.37

but that, I imagine, must be an exceptional case.  READE-1863-1,205.38

During this time, and also from the moment that impregnation
becomes apparent, the mother no longer cohabits with her husband.
READE-1863-1,205.39

Otherwise, say the natives, the child would be born sickly or crippled
<paren> in which case it would be killed <$$paren>, and the milk would
be spoiled.  READE-1863-1,205.40

There are, unfortunately, no such sanitary precautions for the
preservation of the child when once born.  READE-1863-1,205.41

Carried in a sling across the breast, or perched on a bustle behind,
it is exposed to all weathers; READE-1863-1,205.42

and a large proportion of infants perish.  READE-1863-1,205.43

Babies, which in England resemble skinned rabbits, soon lose that
carnation hue in Africa.  READE-1863-1,205.44

It rapidly changes to a yellow frog-color, READE-1863-1,205.45

and then deepens into black.  READE-1863-1,205.46

After a certain period they are released from the sling or bustle,
which is their only cradle, READE-1863-1,205.47

and are left to crawl about on the ground till instinct teaches them
to walk.  READE-1863-1,205.48

Then a string is tied round their waist, READE-1863-1,205.49

and their education <P_206> commences.  READE-1863-1,206.50

Both sexes are taught at the tenderest age to drink palm wine, as if
intoxication were a virtue; READE-1863-1,206.51

and little girls are given lessons in dancing.  READE-1863-1,206.52

I no longer wondered at the intricate steps which these women perform
when I saw a child of two years old circled by women, who were clapping
their hands and singing the nursery refrain, <font> Fear the he-goat , ya!
ya!  ya!  Fear the he-goat!  ya!  ya!  ya!  <$$font> while it wriggled
its little body into the queerest shapes imaginable.  READE-1863-1,206.53

These children are absurdly precocious.  READE-1863-1,206.54

Africa is a great hothouse, in which they are forced by the sun, and in
which they perish prematurely.  READE-1863-1,206.55

They can always talk when they are twelve months old.  READE-1863-1,206.56

At four or five years I have seen them listening with twinkling eyes to
the immoral songs of their seniors, READE-1863-1,206.57

and at eight or nine nature permits them to put in practice those theories
which, incredible as it may seem, they have actually studied beforehand.
READE-1863-1,206.58

So much for savage chastity; READE-1863-1,206.59

and I fear that I can say as little for parental affection.
READE-1863-1,206.60

The father wishes to have a child partly because nature has planted
within his breast an instinct for reproduction second only in power to
that of self-preservation, and partly because that child, if a son, will
help him to hunt or fish, or paddle his canoe, and will give him food
when he is old: if a daughter, he will sell her to a suitor, and will
receive sufficient in return to make him a man of status in his tribe.
READE-1863-1,206.61

He kills the sickly or crippled child because it will cost him
one more mouth to feed without affording him any thing in return.
READE-1863-1,206.62

The maternal instinct which we see so powerful in the mere animal creation
is not absent from the negress.  READE-1863-1,206.63

Ananga accompanied her father, Quenqueza, when I left Ngumbi.
READE-1863-1,206.64

She and her mother both cried very much when she went, although it was
only for a few days.  READE-1863-1,206.65

By secluding mothers during the nursing period, the child has no rival,
while the respect which is paid to the woman because she is a mother
must increase her love for her offspring, as the miseries which some poor
girls endure in our own country have been known to sour all those feelings
which nature has planted within their breasts.  READE-1863-1,206.66

The prettiest song which I ever heard was sung by a mother to her child
in the Balengi country.  READE-1863-1,206.67

If we can believe it, fathers also have sometimes a little love for
their infants: READE-1863-1,206.68

Why dost thou weep, my child?  READE-1863-1,206.69

The sky is bright; READE-1863-1,206.70

the sun is shining: READE-1863-1,206.71

why dost thou weep?  READE-1863-1,206.72

<P_207>

Go to thy father; READE-1863-1,207.74

he loves thee: READE-1863-1,207.75

go, READE-1863-1,207.76

tell him why thou weepest.  READE-1863-1,207.77

What!  thou weepest still.  READE-1863-1,207.78

Thy father loves thee; READE-1863-1,207.79

I caress thee: READE-1863-1,207.80

yet still thou art sad.  READE-1863-1,207.81

Tell me then, my child, why dost thou weep?  READE-1863-1,207.82

Before they are permitted to wear clothes, marry, and rank in society
as men and women, the young have to be initiated into certain mysteries.
READE-1863-1,207.83

I received some information upon this head from Mongilomba, after he
had made me promise that I would not put it in my book - a promise
which I am compelled to break by the stern duties of my vocation.
READE-1863-1,207.84

He told me that he was taken into a fetich-house, stripped, severely
flogged, and plastered with goat-dung; READE-1863-1,207.85

this ceremony, like those of masonry, being conducted to the sound
of music.  READE-1863-1,207.86

Afterward there came from behind a kind of screen or shrine uncouth and
terrible sounds such as he had never heard before.  READE-1863-1,207.87

These, he was told, emanated from a spirit called <font> Ukuk.  <$$font>
READE-1863-1,207.88

He afterward brought to me the instrument with which the fetich-man
makes this noise.  READE-1863-1,207.89

It is a kind of whistle made of hollowed mangrove wood, about two
inches in length, and covered at one end with a scrap of bat's wing.
READE-1863-1,207.90

For a period of five days after initiation the novice wears an apron of
dry palm-leaves, which I have frequently seen.  READE-1863-1,207.91

The initiation of the girls is performed by elderly females who call
themselves <font> ngembi.  <$$font> READE-1863-1,207.92

They go into the forest, READE-1863-1,207.93

clear a place, READE-1863-1,207.94

sweep the ground carefully, READE-1863-1,207.95

come back to the town, READE-1863-1,207.96

and build a sacred hut which no male may enter.  READE-1863-1,207.97

They return to the clearing in the forest, taking with them the <font>
igonji <$$font>, or novice.  READE-1863-1,207.98

It is necessary that she should have never been to that place before, and
that she fast during the whole of the ceremony, which lasts three days.
READE-1863-1,207.99

All this time a fire is kept burning in the wood.  READE-1863-1,207.100

From morning to night, and from night to morning, a <font> ngembi <$$font>
sits beside it READE-1863-1,207.101

and feeds it, singing with a cracked voice, <font> The fire will never
die out!  <$$font> READE-1863-1,207.102

The third night is passed in the sacred hut; READE-1863-1,207.103

the <font> igonji <$$font> is rubbed with black, red, and white paints ,
READE-1863-1,207.104

and, as the men beat drums outside, she cries <font> Okanda, yo!  yo!  yo!
<$$font> which reminds one of the <font> Evohe!  <$$font> of the ancient
Bacchantes.  READE-1863-1,207.105

The ceremonies which are performed in the hut and in the wood are kept
secret from the men, READE-1863-1,207.106

and I can say but little of them.  READE-1863-1,207.107

Mongilomba had evidently been playing the spy, READE-1863-1,207.108

but was very reserved upon the subject.  READE-1863-1,207.109

Should it be known, he said, that he had told me what he had, the women
would drag him into a fetich-house, READE-1863-1,207.110

and would flog him, perhaps, till he was dead.  READE-1863-1,207.111

<P_208>

It is pretty certain, however, that these rites, like those of the Bona
Dea, are essentially of a Phallic nature; READE-1863-1,208.113

for Mongilomba once confessed that, having peeped through the chinks
of the hut, he saw a ceremony like that which is described in Petronius
Arbiter.  READE-1863-1,208.114

I do not think that Mongilomba's fear of the <font> ngembi <$$font>
was affected.  READE-1863-1,208.115

They are really a powerful body, READE-1863-1,208.116

and are held in great respect, perhaps in a little terror, by the men.
READE-1863-1,208.117

They pretend to find out the secrets of their enemies, and to detect
thieves; READE-1863-1,208.118

and I am inclined to believe that the origin of this institution
was to protect wives from being harshly treated by their husbands.
READE-1863-1,208.119

During the novitiate which succeeds initiation, the girls are taught
religious dances, READE-1863-1,208.120

the men are instructed in the science of fetich.  READE-1863-1,208.121

It is then that they are told that there are certain kinds of food which
are forbidden to their clan.  READE-1863-1,208.122

One clan may not eat crocodile, nor another hippopotamus, nor a third
buffalo.  READE-1863-1,208.123

These are relics of the old animal worship.  READE-1863-1,208.124

The spirit <font> Ukuk <$$font> <paren> or Mwetyi, as he is called in the
Shekani country <$$paren> is supposed to live in the bowels of the earth,
and to come to the upper world when there is any business to perform.
READE-1863-1,208.125

He is then supposed to dwell in the fetich house, which is built in a
peculiar form, covered with dried plantain-leaves, and is always kept
perfectly dark.  READE-1863-1,208.126

Thence issue strange sounds, like the growling of a tiger, which make the
women and children shudder and run to their houses.  READE-1863-1,208.127

When the mangrove-tube is thus heard to be at work, the initiated repair
to the house, READE-1863-1,208.128

and"a lodge"is held.  READE-1863-1,208.129

The natives of Equatorial Africa worship also the spirits of their
ancestors, a worship for which their minds are prepared by the veneration
which they pay to old age.  READE-1863-1,208.130

Young men never enter the presence of an aged person without courtesying,
and passing in a stooping attitude, as if they were going under a
low door.  READE-1863-1,208.131

When seated in his presence, it is always at a humble distance.
READE-1863-1,208.132

If they hand him a lighted pipe or a mug of water, they fall on one knee.
READE-1863-1,208.133

If an old man, they address him as <font> rera <$$font> - father; if an
old woman, as <font> ngwe <$$font> - mother.  READE-1863-1,208.134

It is customary for only the old people to communicate bad news to one
another; READE-1863-1,208.135

and it is not to be wondered at that we find the negroes such
perfect courtiers, since it is the etiquette of the country that the
aged should only be addressed in terms of flattery and adulation.
READE-1863-1,208.136

When they die their relics are honored.  READE-1863-1,208.137

In the Congo country <P_209> their bodies are dried into mummies.
READE-1863-1,209.138

Here, their bones are sometimes stored up and visited at set periods.
READE-1863-1,209.139

Or, when a person noted for his wisdom has died, his head, when partially
decomposed, is often cut off and suspended, so as to drip upon a mass
of chalk placed underneath.  READE-1863-1,209.140

This matter is supposed to be the wisdom which formerly animated the
brain, and which, rubbed upon the foreheads of others, will communicate
its virtue.  READE-1863-1,209.141

The worship of their spirits follows the veneration of their relics
naturally enough.  READE-1863-1,209.142

They believe that the shades of their ancestors exercise a beneficent
influence over their lives and fortunes.  READE-1863-1,209.143

They will send messages to their relatives by those who are dying;
READE-1863-1,209.144

and a son has been known to kill his old mother, under the belief
that she would be of more use to him as a spirit than as a substance.
READE-1863-1,209.145

This is the <font> ne plus ultra <$$font> of utilitarianism.
READE-1863-1,209.146

The words which they hear and the sights which they see in their dreams
come to them from spirits.  READE-1863-1,209.147

Always talking of these dreams, and relating them to one another, they
dream the more.  READE-1863-1,209.148

The higher type of negro, with his nervous temperament, and his
imagination lively and vivid as that of a woman, would make an excellent
"medium. "READE-1863-1,209.149

In times of peril or distress one may witness a very touching sight
among these people.  READE-1863-1,209.150

They will assemble in clans on the brink of some mountain brow or on
the skirt of a dense forest, READE-1863-1,209.151

and, extending their arms to the sky, while the women are wailing and
the very children weep, they will cry to the spirits of those who have
passed away.  READE-1863-1,209.152

There is also a curious ceremony which Mongilomba thus related to me:
READE-1863-1,209.153

"The people which are dead, when they are tired of staying in
the bush, then they come for one of their people which they like.
READE-1863-1,209.154

And one ghost will say,'I am tired of staying in the bush,
READE-1863-1,209.155

please to build a little house for me in the town close to your house.
'READE-1863-1,209.156

He tells the man to dance and sing too; READE-1863-1,209.157

so the man call {COM:sic} plenty of women by night to dance and sing.
"READE-1863-1,209.158

He told me that the next day the people would go to the grave of the
<font> obambo <$$font>, or ghost, and make a rude idol; then take the
bamboo frame on which the body had been carried to the grave, and which
is always left there, and some of the grave-dust itself, and carry them
into a little hut which they build near the house of the visited, and
the door of which they cover with a white cloth.  READE-1863-1,209.159

It is worth while mentioning that during the singing and dancing
which accompany this ceremony, like as in all their religious
<P_210> ceremonies, there is one line which is remarkably striking,
READE-1863-1,210.160

for it makes us conclude that they have a legend like that of Charon
and the Styx.  READE-1863-1,210.161

They are singing to the ghost, READE-1863-1,210.162

and the verse is, <font>"You are well dressed, READE-1863-1,210.163

but you have no canoe to go over to the other side. "<$$font>
READE-1863-1,210.164

These natives have their Naiads and Dryads; their spirits which inhabit
lakes, and mountains, and forests, and high places.  READE-1863-1,210.165

They have also their Typhon and their Osiris, their Evil Genius and
their Good Spirit.  READE-1863-1,210.166

The former <paren> <font> Mbwiri <$$font> <$$paren> they worship piously,
being always anxious to deprecate his anger.  READE-1863-1,210.167

They regard him as the Prince of this world; as a tyrant whom they hate,
but before whom they must prostrate themselves.  READE-1863-1,210.168

The Good Spirit, on the other hand, they do not deem it necessary to pray
to in a regular way, because he will not harm them.  READE-1863-1,210.169

The word by which they express this Supreme Being answers exactly to
our word of God.  READE-1863-1,210.170

Like the <font> Jehovah <$$font> of the Hebrews, like that word in masonry
which is only known to masters, and never pronounced but in a whisper and
in full lodge, this word they seldom dare to speak, READE-1863-1,210.171

and they display uneasiness if it is uttered before them.
READE-1863-1,210.172

Twice only I remember having heard it: READE-1863-1,210.173

once, as I have related, when we were in a dangerous storm, the men
threw their clenched hands upward READE-1863-1,210.174

and cried it twice; READE-1863-1,210.175

and again, when I was at Ngumbi, taking down words from an Ashira slave
, I asked him what was the word for God in the language of his country.
READE-1863-1,210.176

He raised his eyes, READE-1863-1,210.177

and pointing to heaven, said, in a soft voice, <font> Njambi.  <$$font>
READE-1863-1,210.178

Among most illiterate nations, diseases of an epileptic character are
ascribed to demoniac possession.  READE-1863-1,210.179

In Africa it is Mbwiri which enters the possessed, and who can
only be driven out by the assistance of the fetich or medicine-man.
READE-1863-1,210.180

A shanty is built in the middle of the street, READE-1863-1,210.181

and this is occupied by the patient, the priest, and his disciples.
READE-1863-1,210.182

Then for ten days or a fortnight there is one perpetual dance to the
sound of flute and drum, every body {COM:here_and_passim_sic} who is
invited eating and drinking as much as he can, Mbwiri being peculiarly
averse to good living.  READE-1863-1,210.183

All this is done at the expense of the next of kin.  READE-1863-1,210.184

The patient dances, usually shamming madness, till the real fit comes
on, with its wild stare, convulsions of limbs, gnashing of teeth, and
foaming at the mouth.  READE-1863-1,210.185

Whatever the man does at such a period is supposed not to be done by
the man, but by the demon which possesses him.  READE-1863-1,210.186

When a cure has been made, real or affected, the patient builds a little
fetich <P_211> house, READE-1863-1,211.187

avoids certain kinds of food, READE-1863-1,211.188

and performs certain duties.  READE-1863-1,211.189

Sometimes the patient has been known to become quite insane; to run
away to the bush, hide from all human beings, and live on the roots and
berries of the forest.  READE-1863-1,211.190

Such cases, as I have been credibly informed, are by no means rare.
READE-1863-1,211.191

These fetich-men are priest-doctors, like those of the ancient Germans.
READE-1863-1,211.192

They have a profound knowledge of herbs, and also of human nature,
READE-1863-1,211.193

for they always monopolize the real power in the state;
READE-1863-1,211.194

but it is very doubtful whether they possess any secrets save that of
extracting virtue and poison from plants.  READE-1863-1,211.195

During the first trip which I made into the bush I sent for one of
these doctors.  READE-1863-1,211.196

At that time I was staying among the Shekani, who are celebrated for
their fetich.  READE-1863-1,211.197

He came attended by half a dozen disciples.  READE-1863-1,211.198

He was a tall man, dressed in white, with a girdle of leopard's skin,
from which hung an iron bell, of the same shape as our sheep-bells.
READE-1863-1,211.199

He had two chalk-marks over his eyes.  READE-1863-1,211.200

I took some of my own hair, READE-1863-1,211.201

frizzled it with a burning-glass, READE-1863-1,211.202

and gave it him.  READE-1863-1,211.203

He popped it with alacrity into his little grass bag; READE-1863-1,211.204

for white man's hair is fetich of the first order.  READE-1863-1,211.205

Then I poured out some raspberry vinegar into a glass,
READE-1863-1,211.206

drank a little of it first, country fashion, READE-1863-1,211.207

and offered it to him, telling him that it was blood from the brains of
great doctors.  READE-1863-1,211.208

Upon this he received it with great reverence, READE-1863-1,211.209

and, dipping his fingers into it as if it was snap-dragon, sprinkled
with it his forehead, both feet between the two first toes, and the
ground behind his back.  READE-1863-1,211.210

He then handed his glass to a disciple, who emptied it, and smacked his
lips afterward in a very secular manner.  READE-1863-1,211.211

I then desired to see a little of his fetich.  READE-1863-1,211.212

He drew on the ground with red chalk some hieroglyphics, among
which I distinguished the circle, the cross, and the crescent.
READE-1863-1,211.213

He said that if I would give him a fine"dash,"he would tell me all
about it.  READE-1863-1,211.214

But as he would not take any thing in reason, and as I knew that he
would tell me nothing of very great importance in public, negotiations
were suspended.  READE-1863-1,211.215

The belief in the supernatural powers of the fetich-man is general among
the natives.  READE-1863-1,211.216

"When a Mpongwe,"said Mongilomba,"wants to get a white man to come
to his house to trade, he goes to Camma, where the best fetich live,
READE-1863-1,211.217

and he says, {TEXT:missing_open_quote} Doctor, I want a medicine for
white man. 'READE-1863-1,211.218

'What will you give me? 'READE-1863-1,211.219

'I will give you two slaves. 'READE-1863-1,211.220

'Your mother is alive? 'READE-1863-1,211.221

'Yes. 'READE-1863-1,211.222

'Then you must give me your mother. 'READE-1863-1,211.223

'No, I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} give you my mother. ' READE-1863-1,211.224

'Then you must take hold of the branch of that tree. '
READE-1863-1,211.225

He <P_212> takes hold of the branch, READE-1863-1,212.226

and it jumps up READE-1863-1,212.227

and takes the man into the tree - READE-1863-1,212.228

fetich, sir, Mr. Reade.  READE-1863-1,212.229

'Now,'says the doctor,'will you give me your mother? '
READE-1863-1,212.230

'Yes,'says the man,'you must have my mother. ' READE-1863-1,212.231

So he comes down, READE-1863-1,212.232

and the doctor shows him his mother in the looking-glass.
READE-1863-1,212.233

This is called okundu.  READE-1863-1,212.234

Then the doctor ties together a branch, a stone, an iron bar, and a long
stick, READE-1863-1,212.235

and tells the Mpongwe to put it in water, what place white man's ship
come for anchor.  READE-1863-1,212.236

When he come back from Camma no man gives him <font> mbolo <$$font>
<paren> the salutation <$$paren>, READE-1863-1,212.237

for they think that he has gone to Camma to get bad fetich.
READE-1863-1,212.238

Proper bad fetich live at Camma.  READE-1863-1,212.239

But when the white man comes to his house, then all people say, 'He has
mbumba. '"READE-1863-1,212.240

The fetich-man is not only a doctor and a priest, READE-1863-1,212.241

he is a witch-finder, READE-1863-1,212.242

and that is perhaps his most important office.  READE-1863-1,212.243

It is a curious thing that, though these people, if you speak to them
about death, will acknowledge that it is a natural visitation, as indeed
may be seen by the verse of a song - Rich man and poor fellow , all men
must die; Bodies are only shadows.  Why should I be sad?  - yet when a
man of rank dies they say that he has been bewitched, READE-1863-1,212.244

and a victim is chosen with the aid of a fetich-man.  READE-1863-1,212.245

This custom is <font> universal <$$font> in Africa, READE-1863-1,212.246

and, as I shall show you, is interesting on account of the striking
analogies which it presents with the witchcraft of mediaeval Europe.
READE-1863-1,212.247

I shall begin in the words of Mongilomba.  READE-1863-1,212.248

"When a man is sick a long time,"said he,"they call <font> ngembi
<$$font>, and if she $can $n't {TEXT:can't} make it well, the fetich-man.
READE-1863-1,212.249

He comes at night, in white dress, with cock's feathers on his head,
and having his bell and his little glass.  READE-1863-1,212.250

He calls two or three relations together into a room.
READE-1863-1,212.251

He does not speak, READE-1863-1,212.252

but always looks in his glass.  READE-1863-1,212.253

Then he tells them that the sickness is not of Mbwiri, nor of Obambo,
nor of God, but that it comes from a witch.  READE-1863-1,212.254

They say to him,'What shall we do? 'READE-1863-1,212.255

He goes out READE-1863-1,212.256

and says,'I have told you; READE-1863-1,212.257

I have no more to say. 'READE-1863-1,212.258

<paren> It seems that there are consulting physicians in Africa.
<$$paren> READE-1863-1,212.259

They give him a dollar's worth of cloth; READE-1863-1,212.260

and every night they gather together in the streets, READE-1863-1,212.261

and they cry,'<font> I know that man who witch my brother.
READE-1863-1,212.262

It is good for you to make him well. '<$$font> READE-1863-1,212.263

Then the witch make him well. "READE-1863-1,212.264

But if the man no get well, they call Bush doctor from Shekani country.
READE-1863-1,212.265

He sings in the language of the Bush.  READE-1863-1,212.266

At night he goes into the street; READE-1863-1,212.267

all people come about him.  READE-1863-1,212.268

He has tiger-cat <P_213> skin in his hand.  READE-1863-1,213.269

He walk in and out among the people, READE-1863-1,213.270

and lay the skin at the feet of the witch, singing all the while.
READE-1863-1,213.271

When the song is done, the people seize the witch READE-1863-1,213.272

and put him in chains, saying,'If you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} make our
brother well, we kill you. '"READE-1863-1,213.273

One evening, as we were sitting in a mission-house at Corisco with the
windows open, we heard a wild and piteous cry rising from a village at
a little distance.  READE-1863-1,213.274

My friends immediately became grave and silent.  READE-1863-1,213.275

The school was in the next room, READE-1863-1,213.276

and two girls who belonged to that village began crying too.
READE-1863-1,213.277

I was told that it was the death-wail, and that it was the knell of more
lives than one.  READE-1863-1,213.278

A chieftain had been some time in a hopeless state, READE-1863-1,213.279

and a woman had been accused of bewitching him.  READE-1863-1,213.280

She had a son about seven years of age, READE-1863-1,213.281

and, fearing lest he should avenge her when he grew up, they had accused
him also of the crime.  READE-1863-1,213.282

They were now prisoners, READE-1863-1,213.283

and as soon as the chief was dead they would be killed.
READE-1863-1,213.284

The next morning, which was Sunday, I went up with Mackey to the village.
READE-1863-1,213.285

The man was not yet dead; READE-1863-1,213.286

he had suddenly become speechless, which had made them believe that he
had died.  READE-1863-1,213.287

I went into the house, READE-1863-1,213.288

and found him lying in a state of stupor on the bamboo bedstead.
READE-1863-1,213.289

The house was completely filled with women, who had taken off their
clothes and shaved their heads in token of mourning, and who were
<font> raining <$$font> tears in their hired and admirably acted grief.
READE-1863-1,213.290

Sometimes one of them would sit by his side, READE-1863-1,213.291

and, throwing her arms round him, would cry, almost in the very words
of the Irish death-lament,"Why did ye die, darling; READE-1863-1,213.292

why did ye die? "READE-1863-1,213.293

for they looked upon him as really dead, since he could no longer speak
to them or look at them.  READE-1863-1,213.294

In grave contrast with their shrill sorrow sat the men, also naked,
in the chief house of the town, silent and fasting.  READE-1863-1,213.295

On the ground, in their midst, crouched the child, the marks of a
severe wound visible on his arm, and his wrists bound together by a
piece of withy.  READE-1863-1,213.296

I shall never forget that child's face.  READE-1863-1,213.297

It wore that expression of dogged endurance which is one of the
traditional characteristics of the savage.  READE-1863-1,213.298

While I was there one of the men held an axe below his eyes:
READE-1863-1,213.299

it was the brute's idea of humor.  READE-1863-1,213.300

The child looked at it without showing a spark of emotion.
READE-1863-1,213.301

Some, equally fearless of death, would have displayed contempt, anger,
or acted curiosity; READE-1863-1,213.302

but he was the perfect stoic.  READE-1863-1,213.303

His eye flashed for a moment when his name was first mentioned, but only
for a moment.  READE-1863-1,213.304

He showed the same indifference when he heard his <P_214> life being
pleaded for as when, a little while before, he had been taunted with
his death.  READE-1863-1,214.305

We did not see the mother.  READE-1863-1,214.306

I was told afterward that she had been flogged till she had confessed
that she, and she only, had bewitched the man.  READE-1863-1,214.307

Her son had confessed the crime as soon as he was taxed with it.
READE-1863-1,214.308

Though confessions extracted by torture are easily explained, it is a
remarkable fact that the <font> witches <$$font> <paren> I use it as a
generic term for both sexes <$$paren> frequently accuse themselves of the
crime, as every body knows they used to do in Europe: READE-1863-1,214.309

they will even enter into minute details, such as directing the people
to look in some particular place, where they will find the witch-power
, which is usually a buried spider or a bundle of dried plants.
READE-1863-1,214.310

Mr. Mackey said that he had come to speak to <font> Okota <$$font>
, the nearest of kin, upon whom, in such cases, all responsibilty
devolves.  READE-1863-1,214.311

Okota came from the midst, READE-1863-1,214.312

and, taking a stool near the feet of the missionary, listened to him
with great attention.  READE-1863-1,214.313

"Death,"said the missionary,"must come to all.  READE-1863-1,214.314

It is foolish to think that if a man dies he is bewitched. "
READE-1863-1,214.315

"Death must come to all,"said Okota,"but not always from God.
READE-1863-1,214.316

Sometimes it comes from the hand of man. "READE-1863-1,214.317

"But how do you know that this comes from the hand of man? "
READE-1863-1,214.318

"The woman has been given <font> quai <$$font> to drink. "
READE-1863-1,214.319

<paren> This <font> quai <$$font> is the drink of ordeal.  <$$paren>
READE-1863-1,214.320

"The <font> quai <$$font> says that she has bewitched him. "
READE-1863-1,214.321

"But <font> quai <$$font> can sometimes be wrong.  READE-1863-1,214.322

When Cabinda went to the Muni, he was lost a long time.
READE-1863-1,214.323

All people said that he was dead.  READE-1863-1,214.324

A man, you said, was the witch; READE-1863-1,214.325

you gave him <font> quai; READE-1863-1,214.326

quai <$$font> said that he had killed him; READE-1863-1,214.327

but Cabinda came back alive, READE-1863-1,214.328

and <font> quai <$$font> was wrong. "READE-1863-1,214.329

At this there was a roar of laughter.  READE-1863-1,214.330

"It is not only <font> quai <$$font>,"said Okota.  READE-1863-1,214.331

"The woman confesses that she has bewitched.  READE-1863-1,214.332

What man comes to you and says'I have stolen your fowl,'if he has not
stolen it?  READE-1863-1,214.333

This woman is killing my brother; READE-1863-1,214.334

when my brother is dead I will kill her. "READE-1863-1,214.335

It was the first time, so Mr. Mackey told me, that a man had ever
spoken so plainly.  READE-1863-1,214.336

They generally pretended to be convinced by his arguments,
READE-1863-1,214.337

and endeavored afterward to kill the witch without his knowing of it.
READE-1863-1,214.338

The ordeal-drink of Equatorial Africa is not the famous red water of
Northern Guinea.  READE-1863-1,214.339

It is prepared from the root of a small shrub called <font> Nkazya
<$$font>, or <font> Quai.  <$$font> READE-1863-1,214.340

Half a pint of this decoction is <P_215> given to the accused.
READE-1863-1,215.341

Small sticks are laid down at the distance of two feet apart,
READE-1863-1,215.342

and, after drinking, he is required to step over them five times.
READE-1863-1,215.343

If it acts upon him as a diuretic, he is pronounced innocent;
READE-1863-1,215.344

but sometimes it produces vertigo: READE-1863-1,215.345

the sticks rise before him like great logs, READE-1863-1,215.346

and in his awkward efforts to stride over them, he reels,
READE-1863-1,215.347

falls to the ground, READE-1863-1,215.348

and is considered guilty.  READE-1863-1,215.349

The chief died after I had gone to Bapuku.  READE-1863-1,215.350

The woman and the boy were both killed: READE-1863-1,215.351

Oshupu was present, READE-1863-1,215.352

and described their execution.  READE-1863-1,215.353

The woman was taken out to sea in a boat, killed with an axe, and thrown
overboard.  READE-1863-1,215.354

The boy was burnt alive; READE-1863-1,215.355

bags of gunpowder were tied to his legs, which made him"jump like a
dog,"as Oshupu expressed it.  READE-1863-1,215.356

I inquired why the boy should be subjected to a death so much more cruel
than that of his mother.  READE-1863-1,215.357

Oshupu was astounded: READE-1863-1,215.358

"Burning more bad!  READE-1863-1,215.359

No, Mr. Reade, burning and drowning all the same. "
READE-1863-1,215.360

<P_216>

This explains well enough the cruelty of the negro: READE-1863-1,216.362

it is the cruelty of the boy who spins a cockchafer on a pin;
READE-1863-1,216.363

it is the cruelty of ignorance.  READE-1863-1,216.364

A twirling cockchafer, and a boy who"jumps like a dog,"are
ludicrous sights to those who do not possess the sense of sympathy.
READE-1863-1,216.365

How useless it is to address such people as these with the logic of
reason, religion, and humanity!  READE-1863-1,216.366

Such superstitions can only be quelled by laws as ruthless as themselves.
READE-1863-1,216.367

Among these equatorial tribes the government is patriarchal, which
is almost equivalent to saying that there is no government at all.
READE-1863-1,216.368

The tribes are divided into clans.  READE-1863-1,216.369

Each clan inhabits a separate village or group of villages,
READE-1863-1,216.370

and at the head of each is a patriarch, the parody of a king.
READE-1863-1,216.371

They are distinguished from the others by the grass-woven cap which they
wear on their heads, and by the staff which they carry in their hands.
READE-1863-1,216.372

They are always rich and aged, READE-1863-1,216.373

therefore they are venerated.  READE-1863-1,216.374

But, though they can exert influence, they can not
{COM:here_and_passim_sic} wield power: READE-1863-1,216.375

they can advise, READE-1863-1,216.376

but they can not command.  READE-1863-1,216.377

In some instances, as in that of Quenqueza, king of the Rembo, the
title and empty honors of royalty are bestowed upon the most influential
patriarch in a district.  READE-1863-1,216.378

This is a vestige of higher civilization and of ancient empire, which
disappears as one descends among the lower tribes.  READE-1863-1,216.379

And in the lowest of all that I have seen, in the small and expiring tribe
of the Bapuku, occupying their patch of coast to the north of the River
Muni, I had the rare privilege of studying that Utopia of philosophy -
a republic in which there existed no invidious distinctions of rank or
wealth, where the men were all equal, and where all property was common.
READE-1863-1,216.380

In this commonwealth, were it not for the women, the men would have
starved.  READE-1863-1,216.381

There the woman is cook, gardener, woodcutter, porter,
READE-1863-1,216.382

and makes herself generally useful when there is any hard work to be done.
READE-1863-1,216.383

Her lord swings in a hammock, READE-1863-1,216.384

smokes tobacco, READE-1863-1,216.385

drinks palm wine, READE-1863-1,216.386

and talks scandal with his friends.  READE-1863-1,216.387

These people are the most indolent and dishonest middle-men upon the
Coast.  READE-1863-1,216.388

If one of them does bring ebony and rubber from the interior, he carefully
hides it, READE-1863-1,216.389

and sells it on the sly, so violating the principles of the constitution .
READE-1863-1,216.390

And even then his wealth is useless to him.  READE-1863-1,216.391

If he builds a house of better materials than the others, or if he
indulges in the foreign luxury of a new cloth, his brothers, with pious
indignation, pull the one down READE-1863-1,216.392

or <P_217> tear the other off his back.  READE-1863-1,217.393

When men are equal, therefore, the women become their beasts of burden
and their slaves.  READE-1863-1,217.394

Where goods are common there can be no progress, READE-1863-1,217.395

for how can there be progress when every incentive to industry is
carefully removed, and when every spark of ambition is stifled in
its birth?  READE-1863-1,217.396

Among the wealthier Mpongwe the married women do not lead so laborious
a life.  READE-1863-1,217.397

The Bush-man can generally afford but one wife, who must find him
his daily bread, and who is robustly beaten if she fails to do so;
READE-1863-1,217.398

but the rich man can indulge in the institutions of polygamy and domestic
slavery, which render the necessary work light enough among so many.
READE-1863-1,217.399

It will seem strange to us that the women should be the stoutest
supporters of polygamy; READE-1863-1,217.400

but, to be able to judge of these matters correctly, you must look
at them from an African, and not from a European point of view.
READE-1863-1,217.401

The wife in Africa is sold by the father to the husband, to whom she
becomes a valuable possession.  READE-1863-1,217.402

She is his servant; READE-1863-1,217.403

she can give him children, which he can sell, or which will also become
his servants.  READE-1863-1,217.404

If she is tolerably good-looking, she can be used to entrap young
bachelors, who have to pay through the nose for their indiscretion.
READE-1863-1,217.405

Matrimony is there a very practical institution.  READE-1863-1,217.406

They have not in their language any words either for <font> jealousy
<$$font> or <font> conjugal love <$$font>, passions which probably do
not exist among them.  READE-1863-1,217.407

If a man marries, and his wife thinks that he can afford another spouse,
she pesters him to marry again, READE-1863-1,217.408

and calls him"a stingy fellow"if he declines to do so.
READE-1863-1,217.409

These women live together, as far as I could judge, in great amity,
READE-1863-1,217.410

but unite in cordially detesting their common husband.
READE-1863-1,217.411

There are few vices of polished life which are not vulgarly represented
here.  READE-1863-1,217.412

Elopements, for instance, are common enough; READE-1863-1,217.413

and the husband, who is as sensitive as he is brutal, suffers under a
great indignity.  READE-1863-1,217.414

Among the semi-civilized tribes the separation is sealed by"damages;
"among the Bush tribes by a melodrama.  READE-1863-1,217.415

The Bush-man who has thus lost the wife of his bosom, or, more properly ,
of his plantation, walks out with his gun READE-1863-1,217.416

and shoots the first person whom he meets.  READE-1863-1,217.417

He then proclaims that he has done this because a man has run away with
his wife.  READE-1863-1,217.418

The clansmen of the murdered man are enraged, not against the husband -
who has simply complied with a usage of society - but because the duty
of the avenger is now cast upon them.  READE-1863-1,217.419

As the gay Lothario <P_218> is out of their reach, they kill a man
belonging to the next village; READE-1863-1,218.420

his friends retaliate on their unsuspecting neighbors;
READE-1863-1,218.421

and so rolls on this ball of destruction till the whole country is on
the alert.  READE-1863-1,218.422

The gates of all the villages are closed and barricaded,
READE-1863-1,218.423

and some luckless clan can gain no opportunity of washing out their
wrong in somebody $else $'s {TEXT:else's} blood.  READE-1863-1,218.424

The chief of that clan then summons a council, READE-1863-1,218.425

and puts forward his claim against the man who has run away with the wife.
READE-1863-1,218.426

The husband has no longer any thing to do with the matter.
READE-1863-1,218.427

The chief of the culprit's clan offers pecuniary compensation,
READE-1863-1,218.428

and general concord is restored.  READE-1863-1,218.429

This practice may appear not only barbarous, but absurd.
READE-1863-1,218.430

But it is only by some means of this kind that private ills, in such a
lawless community, can be made public wrongs.  READE-1863-1,218.431

Even among these savages there is something which corresponds with our
ideas of a code moral.  READE-1863-1,218.432

A girl who disgraces her family by wantonness is banished from her clan
; READE-1863-1,218.433

and, in cases of seduction, the man is severely flogged.
READE-1863-1,218.434

Theft is also punishable by flogging, and adultery by the payment of
a large sum of money, in default of which death or slavery is at the
option of the husband.  READE-1863-1,218.435

It is curious that these people should have a remarkable antipathy
to widows.  READE-1863-1,218.436

Women never marry twice; READE-1863-1,218.437

they are compelled to go on the town on the death of their husband,
and to pay all their earnings to their brothers.  READE-1863-1,218.438

It is an error to suppose that vice is an exotic, and that it can only
flourish when fed with artificial manure.  READE-1863-1,218.439

Besides those brutal habits which, vices among us, are simple customs
among savages, they have real vices, recognized as such among themselves ,
and among themselves openly paraded.  READE-1863-1,218.440

Public opinion has no terrors for the culprits of society;
READE-1863-1,218.441

they fear only the anger and revenge of those whom they have wronged.
READE-1863-1,218.442

That a husband should offer one of his wives to a visitor, as he offers
him a seat in his house and at his table, argues a want of refinement
only.  READE-1863-1,218.443

The custom was anciently common enough.  READE-1863-1,218.444

But the husband who uses his wife, as is done all over Africa, to decoy
young men to ruin, slavery, and death, practices a vice which seldom
occurs among civilized nations.  READE-1863-1,218.445

In the most disgraceful period of Venetian history, we learn from Daru
that mothers used to sell their daughters to wealthy <P_219> patricians
publicly and without shame.  READE-1863-1,219.446

But even then it must have been regarded as a vice; while, not
only in savage Africa, but in semi-civilized Sierra Leone, this
disgraceful commerce is at the very root of their social institutions.
READE-1863-1,219.447

Adultery is regarded by the Africans as a kind of theft.
READE-1863-1,219.448

It is a vice, therefore, and so common that one might write a Decameron
of native tales like those of Boccaccio.  READE-1863-1,219.449

And what in Boccaccio is more poignant and more vicious than this song
of the Benga, which I have often heard them sing, young men and women
together, when no old men were present?  READE-1863-1,219.450

The old men young girls married.  READE-1863-1,219.451

The young girls made the old men fools, READE-1863-1,219.452

For they loved to kiss the young men in the dark, Or beneath the green
leaves of the plantain-tree.  READE-1863-1,219.453

The old men then threatened the young men, READE-1863-1,219.454

And said, you make us look like fools; READE-1863-1,219.455

But we will stab you with our knives till your blood runs forth!
READE-1863-1,219.456

Oh stab us, READE-1863-1,219.457

stab us, cried the young men, gladly, READE-1863-1,219.458

<font> For then your wives will fasten up our wounds.  <$$font>
READE-1863-1,219.459

Such is the child of nature!  Such the noble savage!  Such the primitive
condition of man, which philosophers, who had never studied it, have
dared to hold up to our example!  READE-1863-1,219.460

What is it, then, that they would have us imitate?  READE-1863-1,219.461

Must we instruct our children in vice at the tenderest possible
age , and sell them for marriage as soon as they arrive at puberty?
READE-1863-1,219.462

Must we make our wives mothers when they are scarcely girls; treat
them as slaves when they are women, and kill them when they are old?
READE-1863-1,219.463

Must we place no restraints upon our passions, but abandon our youth to
dissipation and debauchery, that we may have gray hairs on young heads
, and all the foul diseases which spring from the diet and habits of
a brute?  READE-1863-1,219.464

For so does man in an uncivilized condition.  READE-1863-1,219.465

The savage lives a life without a future or a past, without hope or
regret, READE-1863-1,219.466

and dies the death of a coward and a dog, for whom the grave brings
darkness, and nothing more.  READE-1863-1,219.467

Chapter XXI.  READE-1863-1,220.470

Volcanic Flower-Gardens.  READE-1863-1,220.471

<$$heading>

Prince's Island.  READE-1863-1,220.473

- African Champagne.  READE-1863-1,220.474

- Mulatto Politeness.  READE-1863-1,220.475

- St. Thomas.  READE-1863-1,220.476

- The Dutchman's Church-yard.  READE-1863-1,220.477

- Senhor Pereira.  READE-1863-1,220.478

- I become a Spy.  READE-1863-1,220.479

That night, Saturday, June 2, I slept between sheets, in all the dignity
of civilization.  READE-1863-1,220.480

The next day I gave up to a Sabbath repose, which I had, for once in my
life, fairly earned, and which I devoutly enjoyed.  READE-1863-1,220.481

The morning after, at daybreak, my labors began again.
READE-1863-1,220.482

That day I was to leave Equatorial Africa.  READE-1863-1,220.483

In a few hours all my preparations must be made.  READE-1863-1,220.484

So I called my men together, READE-1863-1,220.485

culled a few necessaries from my outfit, READE-1863-1,220.486

stowed them in a couple of stout bullock-trunks, READE-1863-1,220.487

cleaned my rifle READE-1863-1,220.488

and locked it up in a leather case, READE-1863-1,220.489

and packed up my very modest toilet apparatus, with my precious
MSS., in a small valise.  READE-1863-1,220.490

The rest of my property, less valuable than voluminous, I left with my
good friends, who offered to sell that which was salable, and to send
the rest home for me.  READE-1863-1,220.491

In the middle of the day the time came for me to go, READE-1863-1,220.492

and I bade them farewell, hoping that which I scarcely dared to hope,
that we might meet again.  READE-1863-1,220.493

The barque"Guilford"was bound for Fernando Po.  READE-1863-1,220.494

It was my intention to go to that island, where I should find a man-of-war
come there to meet the mails, and to beg a passage to the South Coast.
READE-1863-1,220.495

It happened, however, that a Mr. Sparrhawk, a very intelligent
American trader, discovered before we sailed that he had left behind him
a box of important papers at the Ilha da Princa, from which he had come
a few days previously.  READE-1863-1,220.496

Mr. Knight, agent of the firm <paren> Messrs. Hutton and
Cookson <$$paren> to which the barque belonged, consented to touch there ,
as it was but little out of the way, and as fair winds at this time of
the year can always be depended on going north.  READE-1863-1,220.497

In less than twenty-four hours we"rose"the island, READE-1863-1,220.498

and by evening we laid at anchor in its harbor.  READE-1863-1,220.499

There was a schooner <P_221> lying near us, a beautiful, wicked-looking
jewel of a craft, with rakish tapering masts, and a fluttering top-sail
like a white bonnet.  READE-1863-1,221.500

Ships have their physiognomies, READE-1863-1,221.501

and this seemed a <font> lorette <$$font> of the ocean - a <font>
traviata <$$font> of the high seas.  READE-1863-1,221.502

I fell in love with her on the spot, READE-1863-1,221.503

and asked what her name was, and where she was bound, in the same way
that I would have inquired the name and address of a handsome girl who
had suddenly inspired me with"the divine passion. "READE-1863-1,221.504

When I heard that she was the Mondego, bound for San Thome`, I felt an
irresistible inclination to offer her my company.  READE-1863-1,221.505

From San Thome` I could go by a Portuguese line of steamers to Loanda.
READE-1863-1,221.506

Mr. Sparrhawk, who knew the captain, said that the matter could
be easily arranged; READE-1863-1,221.507

the schooner would sail in four days'time; READE-1863-1,221.508

the passage would take about four days, READE-1863-1,221.509

and I should have to pay about four pounds.  READE-1863-1,221.510

He would introduce me to a gentleman at whose house I could reside while
I remained in the island.  READE-1863-1,221.511

Accordingly, at 10 P.M. , I found myself standing on Portuguese land.
READE-1863-1,221.512

A light was glimmering in the distance, growing smaller and smaller,
till it became a twinkling speck and disappeared.  READE-1863-1,221.513

This was the"Guilford"sailing before the wind, and bound for Fernando Po.
READE-1863-1,221.514

I then remembered that I had only +L20 in cash; that I could not speak
Portuguese; that I had letters for no one in Loanda; that, in short,
having with me no credentials of any kind, an amount of luggage which was
not imposing, and very indifferent wearing apparel, there was nothing
in the world to distinguish me from a <font> chevalier d'industrie.
<$$font> READE-1863-1,221.515

However, reflecting that it was useless to waste thought on such trifles ,
I took my companion's arm, READE-1863-1,221.516

returned to his house, READE-1863-1,221.517

and soon forgot my little difficulties.  READE-1863-1,221.518

The next morning I had leisure to look about me.  READE-1863-1,221.519

I was in the town of San Antonio.  READE-1863-1,221.520

Its bay is the arena of the loveliest amphitheatre one can conceive.
READE-1863-1,221.521

Tier over tier of forest trees form the sides, READE-1863-1,221.522

and a volcanic peak, also covered with trees, might be regarded as a
kind of gallery.  READE-1863-1,221.523

The continuous rustling of the leaves in the wind, and the dull moan of
the waters falling on the beach, reminded me of the hum of human crowds.
READE-1863-1,221.524

My host was a mulatto; a fact to be recognized not only by his skin and
hair, but also by his curiosity respecting my relatives, his reiteration
of the same remarks, and the pompous nature of his hospitality.
READE-1863-1,221.525

He kept a small shop, READE-1863-1,221.526

and had two plantations, with about seventy slaves.  READE-1863-1,221.527

This enabled him to live on the produce <P_222> of his farm.
READE-1863-1,222.528

He drank his own coffee, of which and of cocoa he sold sufficient to
buy him clothes and other necessaries.  READE-1863-1,222.529

He ate baked yams as a substitute for bread; also great quantities of
<font> farinha <$$font>, a flour made from cassada or manioc, and which
closely resembles sawdust.  READE-1863-1,222.530

His farm afforded him fowls, sheep, and pigs in no great quantity;
READE-1863-1,222.531

but the food of the poor people is principally vegetable -
READE-1863-1,222.532

For beef is rare within these ox-less isles, etc.
READE-1863-1,222.533

I found only six white men on this island, three of whom were government
officials.  READE-1863-1,222.534

The houses of the town are well built, but execrably furnished: bare,
ghastly rooms, with an isolated chair or sofa sprinkled here and there,
and looking as if they never had been sat upon, nor were meant to be.
READE-1863-1,222.535

On the unpapered walls hung some of those solemn portraits which one
meets in England in the dining-rooms of the middle classes, and which
are said to be striking likenesses of individuals, but bear little
resemblance to human beings generally.  READE-1863-1,222.536

There was a profusion of churches, READE-1863-1,222.537

and it was curious to see the black priests walking about in their
bombazine gowns and lace collars.  READE-1863-1,222.538

They have a school, in which they teach the small negroes to read and
write; READE-1863-1,222.539

those who are intended for the Church are also instructed in dog-Latin.
READE-1863-1,222.540

Many novices are sent forth from this island <paren> but more still
from San Thome` <$$paren> as missionaries to various parts of the Coast,
READE-1863-1,222.541

and so contribute their mite to the great work of civilization.
READE-1863-1,222.542

It is true that these priests, from all that I have heard, are not models
of virtue, READE-1863-1,222.543

but this may partly be owing to the charming laxity of public manners.
READE-1863-1,222.544

Plato has been much blamed because in his Republic he made the wives
common.  READE-1863-1,222.545

In this little island I had an opportunity of studying this system,
which there exists and flourishes.  READE-1863-1,222.546

I have certainly never seen so many happy people in Africa as I saw upon
Prince's Island, nor so many pretty girls.  READE-1863-1,222.547

A very large proportion are slaves; READE-1863-1,222.548

but they are required to do but little work, READE-1863-1,222.549

for the fertile soil requires small assistance; READE-1863-1,222.550

and the domestic slaves are more numerous, idle, and tyrannical
in a merchant's house in Princa than the servants in Belgravia.
READE-1863-1,222.551

All day long one may see those fascinating creatures tripping about
in the streets in long flowing cotton robes, with handkerchiefs bound
elegantly round their heads; READE-1863-1,222.552

when they see one, they give a smile <P_223> which would bewitch a saint
<paren> imagine the effect upon a sinner!  <$$paren>, READE-1863-1,223.553

and prattle away to you with such gushes of girlish laughter that one's
heart, which Africa has already a little deadened, warms and flushes
into life.  READE-1863-1,223.554

Then other black eyes shine upon you, READE-1863-1,223.555

and soft hands play at hide and seek in your European hair;
READE-1863-1,223.556

and then you sit beneath some noble palm, as says Linnaeus, a prince of
the vegetable kingdom; READE-1863-1,223.557

and there one may sit and drink cocoa-nut milk, and take lessons in
Portuguese patois, and enjoy one's noonday siesta, feeling almost inclined
at times to turn one's back on ambition and the passions of the world,
and there to dream, dream, dream one's life away.  READE-1863-1,223.558

Having led a life of extreme self-denial for some little time, I suddenly
fancied a bottle of Champagne; READE-1863-1,223.559

so I went into my host's shop, READE-1863-1,223.560

and asked him if he had any.  READE-1863-1,223.561

He replied that he had, READE-1863-1,223.562

and, opening a Champagne bottle, poured me out a tumbler of a still,
very sweet, dark brown wine, which I immediately recognized as a <font>
vin`o branco <$$font> of the lowest order.  READE-1863-1,223.563

To all my arguments that this wine was not Champagne, nor any thing like
it, he replied by showing me the label on the bottle; READE-1863-1,223.564

and although, providentially, he could not compel me to drink it,
I had to pay for it, and as dearly as if I had bought it at Cremorne.
READE-1863-1,223.565

Great men are never discouraged by difficulties.  READE-1863-1,223.566

I had made the acquaintance of a young man named Francisco, who spoke
English remarkably well, and whom I paid a dollar a day to act as my
interpreter and general informant.  READE-1863-1,223.567

He had taken me to several coffee and cocoa plantations,
READE-1863-1,223.568

and had shown me the churches and the cemetery, the barracks and the fort.
READE-1863-1,223.569

I asked him if it was possible to obtain a bottle of Champagne in
the island.  READE-1863-1,223.570

He said he did not think that it could be bought, but that his friend
the collector of customs had some, and, if I went to see him, would be
sure to offer some.  READE-1863-1,223.571

Accordingly, we walked through the town, READE-1863-1,223.572

crossed a stream by means of stepping-stones, READE-1863-1,223.573

passed through a grove of cocoa-nut-trees, READE-1863-1,223.574

ascended a hill-path skirted by plantations, READE-1863-1,223.575

and entered the picturesque dwelling of the Collector of Customs.
READE-1863-1,223.576

He was a good-natured little mulatto, READE-1863-1,223.577

and was celebrated in the island as the possessor of an opera-glass.
READE-1863-1,223.578

The view from his house was worthy of the glass, READE-1863-1,223.579

and appeared doubly beautiful to one who had passed five months among
the dreary forests of the continent.  READE-1863-1,223.580

These islands of Princa and San Thome` may be called volcanic
flower-gardens.  READE-1863-1,223.581

With Annobom, they seem to belong to <P_224> a range of mountains
resembling in features the Sierra del Crystal on the main land.
READE-1863-1,224.582

The peak of Cameroons is 14,000 feet high; READE-1863-1,224.583

that of Fernando Po <paren> in the same latitude <$$paren> is 10,000;
San Thome`, 8000; Annobom, 2000.  READE-1863-1,224.584

In the same manner, the Sierra del Crystal range, which may be said to
commence with the Cameroons, appears also to dwindle as it runs south,
READE-1863-1,224.585

and presents the same forest-crowned features, and, as far as I can judge,
the same geological characters.  READE-1863-1,224.586

As Francisco had predicted, the collector asked me whether I preferred
gin or Champagne, READE-1863-1,224.587

and, on receiving my answer, brought in a pint bottle with a large label
on its side - <font> Fine Crab-apple Cider.  <$$font> READE-1863-1,224.588

This he opened, READE-1863-1,224.589

and, with many fears of the colic, I helped to drink it; after which he
asked me, with unblushing effrontery, if I liked the quality of the wine.
READE-1863-1,224.590

The words <font> cider <$$font> and <font> cidra <$$font> being so much
alike, and this same drink being afterward offered to me at other houses
in the same manner, I concluded crab-apple cider at Prince's Island to
hold the same position as gooseberry wine in England; and that among
certain classes the most undisguised imitation is offered with audacity,
and received with well-bred ignorance.  READE-1863-1,224.591

We dined with the good collector, who told me that the revenue of the
island to government was about +L1000.  READE-1863-1,224.592

The taxes were very heavy, READE-1863-1,224.593

and one had lately been levied upon slaves.  READE-1863-1,224.594

On returning to the town, we found it tastefully illuminated by
means of oranges hollowed and filled with palm-oil and a cotton wick.
READE-1863-1,224.595

It was some feast-day.  READE-1863-1,224.596

Then we met a procession of young girls, playing musical instruments,
and singing as they went.  READE-1863-1,224.597

Joachim told me that every night the girls went to dance at one of the
houses, a different house being taken each night, the host or hostess
providing refreshments.  READE-1863-1,224.598

I admired this genial custom, READE-1863-1,224.599

and wondered whether I was really in a land of slavery.
READE-1863-1,224.600

Joachim, having spoken with one of the young ladies, told me that feasting
and dancing would that night be kept up till daybreak, and with unusual
vigor.  READE-1863-1,224.601

Seven days ago a child had been born in the house they were going to.
READE-1863-1,224.602

It was a popular belief that on the seventh day the midwife can
transform herself into an owl, and will come to suck the child's blood.
READE-1863-1,224.603

But, as the witch can not endure good company, these girls crowd to the
house toward evening.  READE-1863-1,224.604

There they watch and sing; also dancing, eating, and drinking till
the dawn.  READE-1863-1,224.605

This effectually disturbs the scheme of the witch and the slumbers of
the neighborhood.  READE-1863-1,224.606

<P_225>

On the third day of my residence, my mulatto entertainer told me <paren>
he could speak a little bad French <$$paren> that the"Mondego"would sail
on the morrow; that it would be necessary for me to take a passport ,
which it would give me a great deal of trouble to get myself, and that ,
if I liked, he would arrange the matter for me.  READE-1863-1,225.608

To this I consented; READE-1863-1,225.609

and he contrived to arrange it so ingeniously that I paid for my
passport a price which I believe no son of Adam ever paid before.
READE-1863-1,225.610

What with this petty larceny, and with the few things which I had bought
from his shop, and for which he charged cent per cent., I reckoned
that I paid for his hospitality at the same rate that I should have paid
at the Clarendon or the Clarges; READE-1863-1,225.611

but I preferred to do that rather than lie under an obligation to him.
READE-1863-1,225.612

But the captain of the"Mondego,"who heard of it afterward, was very
indignant, READE-1863-1,225.613

and declared that he would expose the fraud to the governor:
READE-1863-1,225.614

he also expressed an opinion that mulattoes inherited the vices of both
races - a maxim which I had heard often enough before, and which is not
altogether without truth for its foundation.  READE-1863-1,225.615

I found this captain and his first officer extremely agreeable and
well-informed men.  READE-1863-1,225.616

The vessel sailed close to the wind, which, as we were going south,
was always against us, READE-1863-1,225.617

and we made the passage in four days.  READE-1863-1,225.618

There lay the island of San Thome`, with its peak towering to the clouds,
and its sides dotted with Nature's richest mantle of leaves and flowers.
READE-1863-1,225.619

A very pretty town, Santa Anna de Chaves, lay smiling in the bay,
READE-1863-1,225.620

and the chimes from the bells of her seven churches made me believe that
I once more approached civilization.  READE-1863-1,225.621

We landed, READE-1863-1,225.622

and our captain exchanged greetings with a number of merchants, who stood
by the door of the custom-house watching the disembarkation of a cargo.
READE-1863-1,225.623

I was then introduced to Senhor Pereira, the owner of the schooner,
and the Monte Christo of the island.  READE-1863-1,225.624

He had begun life as mate or master of a slave ship, which was taken by
an English cruiser.  READE-1863-1,225.625

He was set ashore, in accordance with the regular rule, at the first place
they touched, which happened to be Prince's Island.  READE-1863-1,225.626

He had two dollars in his pocket, READE-1863-1,225.627

and he had only his pocket in the world.  READE-1863-1,225.628

He came over to San Thome`, READE-1863-1,225.629

and speculated so cleverly in <font> black ivory <$$font>,
READE-1863-1,225.630

and applied himself so closely to business - never touching wine nor
taking any kind of pleasure - that he became rich, and was now the owner
<P_226> of two fine vessels, and could lay his hand <paren> so they said
<$$paren> on a million of dollars when he pleased.  READE-1863-1,226.631

His house was furnished with a gaudy want of taste, READE-1863-1,226.632

and his drawing-room reminded me of those in which one is so often
received in small country houses, and which are evidently never used
except to receive visitors.  READE-1863-1,226.633

He had, however, a good table, READE-1863-1,226.634

and every day dined a dozen guests.  READE-1863-1,226.635

On this occasion we were served with a very excellent <font> pure`e
<$$font>, to which the Portuguese added black olives, like those which
grow in the south of France.  READE-1863-1,226.636

They laughed to distraction when I said that the English preferred olives
with their wine.  READE-1863-1,226.637

Then came a grand <font> bouilli <$$font> <paren> rare luxury in Africa
<$$paren>, and a fair variety of <font> entre`es <$$font> and <font>
entremets.  <$$font> READE-1863-1,226.638

A cup of home-grown coffee concluded the feast.  READE-1863-1,226.639

The coffee grown on these two islands is celebrated, READE-1863-1,226.640

and is bought up by the grandees of the Peninsula.  READE-1863-1,226.641

It is kept till it is four years of age; READE-1863-1,226.642

for coffee, like port, improves by time.  READE-1863-1,226.643

Then it is prepared with the greatest nicety; READE-1863-1,226.644

you take it without sugar or milk, READE-1863-1,226.645

and you find that you have arrived at an epoch in your life:
READE-1863-1,226.646

an exquisite aroma gently ascends your nostrils; READE-1863-1,226.647

you kiss the dark potion with your lips; READE-1863-1,226.648

and, as it trickles across your palate, you feel an exquisite thrill
throughout your frame.  READE-1863-1,226.649

I noticed that only one bottle of wine, and that of an ordinary kind
<paren> <font> vino tinto <$$font> <$$paren>, had been placed upon
the table.  READE-1863-1,226.650

Except myself, scarcely any one had touched it.  READE-1863-1,226.651

I had drank it all but a glass or so, which I had left for manners.
READE-1863-1,226.652

I had heard that the Portuguese on the Coast were hard drinkers,
READE-1863-1,226.653

and was astonished at this abstinence.  READE-1863-1,226.654

But I was informed that, in the first place, only the Portuguese traders
in the Congo affect to keep pace with true Britons in the way of drink;
secondly, that the island was under a cloud, and that all were living
in great temperance.  READE-1863-1,226.655

Dysentery in an epidemic form had raged during a month,
READE-1863-1,226.656

and in a small population of white men the deaths had averaged five a day.
READE-1863-1,226.657

That was why I saw so few white men, they told me.  READE-1863-1,226.658

"To live strictly by rule,"says Rochefoucauld,"is one of the most
troublesome diseases that there is;"READE-1863-1,226.659

so I lived as usual, except that I took care to eat plenty of fruit;
READE-1863-1,226.660

for I have observed that dysentery is almost always preceded by
constipation, of which it is, in fact, the result.  READE-1863-1,226.661

The dysentery of San Thome` is of a peculiar kind, which the French call
<font> gras fondu.  <$$font> READE-1863-1,226.662

This island of San Thome` had always a bad name; READE-1863-1,226.663

and in those days when the Hollanders and the Portuguese fought in
these <P_227> dull seas, fleet against fleet, and won these colonies
and lost them turn by turn, it used to be called the Dutch Church-yard.
READE-1863-1,227.664

More fertile than Principe, it is also more malarious;
READE-1863-1,227.665

and it is this terrible fertility which exhales life-destroying vapors,
and which is too rich even for the sugar-cane.  READE-1863-1,227.666

John II. of Portugal in 1484, finding that the climate was so
unhealthy, gave the Jews in his kingdom the agreeable choice of being
baptized or of colonizing San Thome`.  READE-1863-1,227.667

Great numbers were sent out, READE-1863-1,227.668

and married with women brought over from Angola.  READE-1863-1,227.669

From this union arose a mixed race, which the Portuguese firmly
perpetuated.  READE-1863-1,227.670

I could detect no relic of the Jewish type, which is decidedly
providential, READE-1863-1,227.671

for a union of the Jew and the negro would be, commercially speaking,
dangerous to Christianity.  READE-1863-1,227.672

There is also an exotic race upon the island.  READE-1863-1,227.673

In the year 1544 a slaver dropped her anchor off Sete Pedras Megras
to water.  READE-1863-1,227.674

The negroes, seeing land, assassinated their officers READE-1863-1,227.675

and escaped.  READE-1863-1,227.676

They were well received by the savages who inhabited the south part of
the island, and who called them <font> Angolares <$$font>, a name they
have preserved.  READE-1863-1,227.677

Requiring wives, this youthful republic had recourse to a rape resembling
that of the Sabines.  READE-1863-1,227.678

They hid themselves in the neighborhood of Santa Anna de Chaves,
READE-1863-1,227.679

and carried off a number of women to the bush.  READE-1863-1,227.680

In forty years'time, having become very numerous, they attacked the
people to the north, and afterward the plantations of the Portuguese.
READE-1863-1,227.681

During more than a century the depredations of these bandits continued.
READE-1863-1,227.682

This had much to do with the emigration of the traders to Brazil, and
the consequent ruin of the colony, then prosperous.  READE-1863-1,227.683

At last, in 1693, General Antonio Pereira de Berredo, having commanded
Captain Mathews Pires to attack them in their mountain strongholds,
the expedition proved successful; READE-1863-1,227.684

two thirds of the enemy were killed or taken captive, READE-1863-1,227.685

and the <font> guerra do matto <$$font> <paren> bush war <$$paren>
was ended.  READE-1863-1,227.686

The remnant of the Angolares joined the people of Angora de San Joa`o,
READE-1863-1,227.687

entered semi-civilized life, READE-1863-1,227.688

and took to the city wares to sell, consisting of large canoes, fruits,
birds, calabashes.  READE-1863-1,227.689

The purity of this race is preserved by their intermarriages, and also
by their pride, READE-1863-1,227.690

for they will do no menial work.  READE-1863-1,227.691

They form a colony within a colony, READE-1863-1,227.692

and they have customs which are said to be extremely curious.
READE-1863-1,227.693

The eight days which I was forced to pass at this island were not spent
very profitably.  READE-1863-1,227.694

I lived on board the"Mondego"all the while.  READE-1863-1,227.695

There was a very simple reason for this: READE-1863-1,227.696

the residents <P_228> would not receive me in their houses,
READE-1863-1,228.697

and there were no public hotels.  READE-1863-1,228.698

It seems that I had become a secret emissary of Lords Palmerston and
Russell, having been sent here to watch the <font> modus operandi <$$font>
of the slave-trade; to send secret intelligence to the commanders of
the cruisers; and to communicate to the government some Utopian plan
for the abolition of the slave-trade.  READE-1863-1,228.699

The Portuguese can not understand, and will not believe, that a man can
leave London, to visit this plague-spot of creation at his own expense,
from motives of enterprise and curiosity.  READE-1863-1,228.700

It was plain to them that I was not a trader.  READE-1863-1,228.701

Having already learned to swear fluently in Portuguese, and having plainly
no pretension to superior virtue, I could scarcely be a missionary -
even a heretic.  READE-1863-1,228.702

Argal, I was a spy; READE-1863-1,228.703

I was a Fosco, a Machiavel, a Mephistopheles; READE-1863-1,228.704

I was a serpent who desired to warm myself in their confiding
breasts, that I might distill the poison more freely from my fangs!
READE-1863-1,228.705
