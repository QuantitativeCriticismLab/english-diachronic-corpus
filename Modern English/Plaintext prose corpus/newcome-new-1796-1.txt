The Gospel according to St. John.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.3

<$$heading>

The Word was in the beginning, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.5

and the Word was with God, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.6

and the Word was God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.7

This <font> Word <$$font> was in the beginning with God.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.8

All things were made by him; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.9

and without him was not any thing made that was made.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.10

In him was life; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.11

and the life was the light of men.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.12

And the light shone in darkness; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.13

and the darkness overspread it not.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.14

There was a man sent from God, whose name <font> was <$$font> John.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.15

This man came for a testimony, to testify of the Light; <font> so <$$font>
that through him all might believe.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.16

He was not that Light, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.17

but <font> was sent <$$font> to testify of that Light.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.18

<font> That <$$font> was the true Light, which enlighteneth every man,
coming into the world.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.19

He was in the world, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.20

and the world was made by him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.21

and yet the world knew him not.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.22

He came to his own; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.23

and yet those who were his own received him not.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.24

But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become children
of God, <font> even <$$font> to them who believe in his name: who were
born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
but of God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.25

And the Word became flesh, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.26

and dwelt among us <paren> and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only-begotten <font> who came <$$font> from the Father <$$paren>
full of favour and of truth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.27

John bare witness of him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.28

and cried, saying;"This was he of whom I spake, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.29

'He who Cometh after me, goeth before me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.30

for he was before me,'{TEXT:missing_close_double_quote}
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.31

And of his fullness we have all received; and favour upon favour.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.32

For the law was given by Moses; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.33

<font> but <$$font> favour and truth came by Jesus Christ.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.34

No man hath seen God at any time; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.35

the only-begotten <bracket> Son <$$bracket> that is in the bosom of the
Father, he hath declared <font> him.  <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.36

And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites
from Jerusalem, to ask him;"Who art Thou? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,1J.37

<P_1,20J>

and he confessed, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.39

and denied not, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.40

but confessed,"I am not the Christ. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.41

And they asked him;"What then?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.42

Art thou Elijah? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.43

and he saith,"I am not. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.44

"Art thou a prophet? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.45

and he answered,"No. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.46

Then they said unto him;"Who art thou?  that we may give an answer to
those who sent us.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.47

What sayest thou of thyself? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.48

He said;"I <font> am <$$font> the voice of one crying in the desert,
'Make straight the way of the Lord:'as said the prophet Isaiah.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.49

Now those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.50

Then they asked him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.51

and said unto him;"Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not the Christ ,
nor Elijah, nor a prophet? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.52

John answered them, saying;"I baptize with water:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.53

but there standeth one amidst you, whom ye know not; <font> even <$$font>
he who cometh after me; the latchet of whose sandal I am not worthy to
unloose. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.54

These things passed in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.55

The next day John beholdeth Jesus coming unto him,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.56

and saith;"See, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.57

This is he of whom I said;'After me cometh a man, who goeth before me;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.58

for he was before me. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.59

And I knew him not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.60

but I therefore came baptizing with water, that he might be made manifest
to Israel. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.61

John also bare witness, saying;"I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven
as a dove; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.62

and it abode upon him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.63

And I knew him not <font> then: <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.64

but he who sent me to baptize with water had said unto me;'Upon whom thou
shalt see the Spirit coming down and abiding, this is he who baptizeth
with the Holy Spirit. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.65

And I saw, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.66

and bare witness that this is the Son of God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.67

<font> On <$$font> the next day, John was again standing, and two of
his disciples: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.68

and he looked on Jesus <font> who was <$$font> walking,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.69

and saith;"Behold the Lamb of God. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.70

And the two disciples heard him speak, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.71

and followed Jesus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.72

Then Jesus turned, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.73

and saw them following, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.74

and saith unto them;"What seek ye? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.75

And they said unto him;"Rabbi, <paren> which signifieth,
being interpreted, Master <$$paren> where dwellest thou? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.76

He saith unto them;"Come and see. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.77

They came NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.78

and saw where he dwelt, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.79

and abode with him that day: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.80

<paren> <font> now <$$font> it was about the tenth hour.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,20J.81

<P_1,40J>

One of the two that heard John <font> speak <$$font>, and
followed <font> Jesus <$$font> was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.83

He meeteth with his own brother Simon first <font> of any <$$font>,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.84

and saith to him;"We have found the Messiah:"<paren> which
is, being interpreted, <font> the <$$font> Christ.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.85

And <font> Andrew <$$font> brought him to Jesus.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.86

And Jesus looked on him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.87

and said;"Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.88

thou shalt be called Cephas:"<paren> which being interpreted, is, a rock.
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.89

The day following, Jesus purposed to go into Galilee;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.90

and meeteth with Philip, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.91

and saith unto him,"Follow me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.92

Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.93

Philip meeteth with Nathanael, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.94

and saith unto him;"We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and
the prophets <font> also, <$$font> wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
Joseph. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.95

Then Nathanael said unto him;"Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.96

Philip saith unto him;"Come and see. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.97

Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.98

and saith of him;"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.99

Nathanael saith unto him;"Whence knowest thou Me? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.100

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.101

and said unto him;"Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the
fig-tree, I saw thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.102

Nathanael answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.103

and saith unto him;"Master, thou art the Son of God;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.104

thou art the King of Israel. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.105

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.106

and said unto him;"Because I said unto thee,'I saw thee under the
fig-tree,'believest thou?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.107

thou shalt see greater things than these. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.108

Then <font> Jesus <$$font> saith unto him;"Verily verily I say unto
you, <bracket> Hereafter <$$bracket> ye shall see heaven opened,
and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,1,40J.109

<P_2,1J>

And the third day there was a marriage-feast in Cana of Galilee;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.111

and the mother of Jesus was there: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.112

And Jesus and his disciples also were invited to the marriage-feast.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.113

And when <font> the <$$font> wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto
him;"They have no wine. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.114

Jesus saith unto her;"Woman, what have I to do with thee?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.115

mine hour is not yet come. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.116

His mother saith to the servants;"Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <font>
it <$$font>. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.117

Now six water-pots of stone were placed there, according to the manner
of cleansing among the Jews, containing two or three baths apiece.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.118

Jesus saith unto them;"Fill the water-pots with water. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.119

And they filled them to the brim.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.120

Then he saith unto them;"Draw out now, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.121

and bear to the governour of the feast. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.122

And they bare <font> it.  <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.123

And when the governour of the feast had tasted the water which was made
wine, and knew not whence it was; <paren> but the servants who drew the
water knew; <$$paren> the governour of the feast calleth the bridegroom ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.124

and saith unto him;"Every man at first setteth on good wine ; and when men
have drunk largely, then that which is worse: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.125

<font> but <$$font> thou hast kept the good wine until now. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.126

This beginning of miracles Jesus made in Cana of Galilee,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.127

and manifested his glory: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.128

and his disciples believed in him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.129

After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.130

and they remained there not many days.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.131

Now the passover of the Jews was near; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.132

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.133

and found in the temple those who sold cattle, and sheep, and doves,
and the money-changers sitting: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.134

and, when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out
of the temple, and the sheep, and the cattle; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.135

and poured out the money of the exchangers, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.136

and overturned <font> their <$$font> tables; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.137

and said to those who sold doves;"Take these things hence;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.138

make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.139

And his disciples remembered, that it was written;"A zeal for thine
house consumeth me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.140

Then the Jews spake NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.141

and said unto him;"What sign shewest thou unto us, since thou doest
these things? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.142

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.143

and said unto them;"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,1J.144

<P_2,20J>

Then the Jews said;"Forty and six years hath this temple been in building;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.146

and wilt Thou raise it up in three days? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.147

But he spake concerning the temple of his body.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.148

When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
remembered that he had said this <bracket> unto them: <$$bracket>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.149

and they believed the scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.150

Now, when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the passover, many
believed on his name, when they beheld the miracles which he did.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.151

But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all <font>
of them: <$$font> and because he needed not that any should testify of
man: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.152

for he himself knew what was in man.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,2,20J.153

<P_3,1J>

Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.155

this man came to <font> Jesus <$$font> by night,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.156

and said unto him;"Master, we know that thou art a teacher come from God:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.157

for no man can do these miracles which thou doest, unless God be with
him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.158

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.159

and said unto him;"Verily verily I say unto thee, Unless a man
be born again, he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} see the kingdom of God.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.160

Nicodemus saith unto him;"How can a man be born when he is old?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.161

can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.162

Jesus answered;"Verily verily I say unto thee, Unless a man be born of
water, and <font> of <$$font> the Spirit, he $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
enter into the kingdom of God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.163

That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.164

and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.165

Wonder not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.166

The wind bloweth where it will, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.167

and thou hearest its {TEXT:it's} sound, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.168

but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.169

so is every one that is born of the Spirit. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.170

Nicodemus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.171

and said unto him;"How can these things be? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.172

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.173

and said unto him;"Art thou a teacher in Israel,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.174

and knowest not these things?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.175

Verily verily I say unto thee, We speak that which we know,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.176

and testify that which we have seen; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.177

and yet ye receive not our testimony.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.178

If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not; how will ye
believe, if I tell you heavenly things?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.179

Now no man goeth up to heaven, but he who came down from heaven
, <font> even <$$font> the Son of man, who was in heaven.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.180

And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man
be lifted up that every one who believeth in him may <bracket> not perish
, but <$$bracket> have everlasting life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.181

For God hath so loved the world, that he hath given his only-begotten Son,
that everyone who believeth in him may not perish, but have everlasting
life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.182

For God hath not sent his Son into the world, to condemn the world; but
that the world through him might be saved.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.183

He who believeth in him, shall not be condemned:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.184

but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he
hath not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.185

And this is the condemnation; that light is come into the world, and
yet men have loved darkness rather than light: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.186

for their deeds were evil: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,1J.187

<P_3,20J>

for every one who doeth evil hateth the light,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.189

and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be discovered.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.190

But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
be made manifest, that they are wrought <font> through faith <$$font>
in God. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.191

After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.192

and there he tarried with them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.193

and baptized.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.194

And John also was baptizing in Enon, near Salim; because much water was
there; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.195

and <font> the people <$$font> came, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.196

and were baptized.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.197

For John was not yet cast into prison.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.198

Then a question arose between <font> some <$$font> of John's disciples
and a Jew, about baptizing.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.199

And <font> some <$$font> came to John, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.200

and said unto him;"Master, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom
thou barest witness, behold, he baptizeth, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.201

and all <font> men <$$font> come to him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.202

John answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.203

and said;"A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.204

Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said;'I am not the Christ,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.205

but I am sent before his face. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.206

He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.207

but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth
greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.208

This my joy therefore is complete.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.209

He must increase, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.210

but I <font> must <$$font> decrease.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.211

He that cometh from above, is above all: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.212

he that is from the earth, is from the earth, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.213

and speaketh from the earth: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.214

he that cometh from heaven <bracket> is above all;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.215

and <$$bracket> testifieth what he hath seen and heard;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.216

and yet none receiveth his testimony.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.217

He that hath received his testimony, hath set his seal <font> to confirm
<$$font> that God is true.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.218

For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.219

for <bracket> God <$$bracket> giveth him not the Spirit by measure.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.220

The Father loveth the Son, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.221

and hath given all things into his hand.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.222

He who believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.223

and he who disbelieveth the Son, will not see life;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.224

but the anger of God abideth on him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,3,20J.225

<P_4,1J>

When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that he made
and baptized more disciples than John; <paren> though Jesus himself
baptized not, but <font> his <$$font> disciples; <$$paren> he left Judea,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.227

and went again into Galilee.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.228

Now he must needs go through Samaria.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.229

He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near
to the portion of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.230

Now Jacob's well was there.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.231

So Jesus, being wearied with <font> his <$$font> journey, sat afterward
on the well.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.232

<paren> It was about the sixth hour.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.233

A woman of Samaria cometh to draw water.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.234

Jesus saith unto her;"Give me to drink. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.235

<paren> For his disciples were gone to the city, that they might buy food.
<$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.236

Then the Samaritan woman saith unto him;"Why dost thou, being a Jew,
ask drink of me, that am a Samaritan? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.237

<paren> for the Jews have no <font> friendly <$$font> dealings with
the Samaritans.  <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.238

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.239

and said unto her;"If thou knewest the bounty of God, and who he is
that saith unto thee,'Give me to drink;'thou wouldest have asked of him,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.240

and he would have given thee living water. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.241

The woman saith unto him;"Sir, thou hast no vessel to draw with,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.242

and the well is deep: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.243

whence then canst thou have that living water?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.244

Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself
drank of it, and his sons, and his cattle? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.245

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.246

and said unto her;"Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.247

but whosoever shall drink of the water which I {TEXT:I_which} shall give
him, will never thirst; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.248

but the water which I shall give him will be in him a well of water
springing up to everlasting life. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.249

The woman saith unto him;"Sir, give me this water; that I thirst not,
nor come hither to draw. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.250

Jesus saith unto her;"Go, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.251

call thine husband, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.252

and come hither. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.253

The woman answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.254

and said;"I have no husband. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.255

Jesus saith unto her;"Thou hast rightly said,'I have no husband:
'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.256

for thou hast had five husbands; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.257

and he whom thou now hast, is not thine husband:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.258

thou hast spoken this truly. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.259

The woman saith unto him;"Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,1J.260

<P_4,20J>

Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.262

and ye say; that in Jerusalem is the place where <font> men <$$font>
ought to worship. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.263

Jesus saith unto her;"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye
shall worship the Father neither on this mountain nor at Jerusalem.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.264

Ye worship what ye know not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.265

we worship what we know: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.266

for salvation is from the Jews.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.267

But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
will worship the Father in spirit and <font> in <$$font> truth:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.268

for indeed the Father seeketh such worshippers of him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.269

God <font> is <$$font> a spirit: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.270

and the worshippers of him ought to worship <font> him <$$font> in spirit
and <font> in <$$font> truth. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.271

The woman saith unto him;"I know that <font> the <$$font> Messiah
cometh: <paren> which signifieth <font> the <$$font> Christ: <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.272

when he is come, he will tell us all things. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.273

Jesus saith unto her;"I, who talk with thee, am <font> he <$$font>.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.274

And upon this his disciples came, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.275

and wondered that he talked with the woman: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.276

yet none said;"What seekest thou? "or,"Why talkest thou with
her? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.277

The woman then left her bucket, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.278

and went into the city, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.279

and saith to the men;"Come, see a man who hath told me all things whatever
I did: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.280

is this the Christ? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.281

<font> Then <$$font> they went out of the city,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.282

and came unto him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.283

In the mean time his disciples besought him, saying;"Master, eat.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.284

But he said unto them;"I have food to eat, which ye know not of.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.285

Then the disciples said one to another;"Hath any one brought him <font>
any thing <$$font> to eat? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.286

Jesus saith unto them;"My food is, to do the will of him who sent me,
and to finish his work.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.287

Say ye not,'There are yet four months, and <font> then <$$font> cometh
the harvest? 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.288

behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.289

and look on the fields; that they are already white for harvest.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.290

<font> And <$$font> he who reapeth receiveth wages,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.291

and gathereth a crop, to everlasting life: that both he who soweth,
and he who reapeth, may rejoice together.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.292

For herein is that saying true; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.293

'One soweth, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.294

and another reapeth. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.295

I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.296

others have laboured, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.297

and ye are entered into their labours. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.298

And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him, for the words
of the woman who testified;"He told me all things whatever I did.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,20J.299

<P_4,40J>

When therefore the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that
he would abide with them: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.301

and he abode there two day's.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.302

And many more believed because of his own words;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.303

and said to the woman;"We no longer believe because of thy report:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.304

for we ourselves have heard him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.305

and know that this is indeed <bracket> the Christ, <$$bracket> the
Saviour of the world. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.306

Now after the two days he departed thence, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.307

and went into Galilee.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.308

For Jesus himself declared that a prophet hath no honour in his own
country.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.309

So when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him,
having seen all the things which he did in Jerusalem at the feast:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.310

for they also had gone to the feast.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.311

So <font> Jesus <$$font> came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had
made the water wine.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.312

And there was one of the king's household, whose son was sick at
Capernaum.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.313

This man, when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee,
went to him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.314

and besought <bracket> him <$$bracket> that he would come down and cure
his son: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.315

for he was at the point of death.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.316

Then Jesus said unto him;"Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will not
believe. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.317

He of the king's household saith unto him;"Sir, come down, before my
child die. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.318

Jesus saith unto him;"Depart; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.319

thy son liveth. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.320

And the man believed the words which Jesus had spoken unto him,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.321

and departed.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.322

And as he was now going down, his servants met him,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.323

and told <font> him, <$$font> saying;"Thy son liveth. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.324

Then he enquired of them the hour when <font> his son <$$font> began
to amend.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.325

And they said unto him;"Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left
him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.326

So the father knew that <font> it was <$$font> at the very hour, in which
Jesus had said unto him;"Thy son liveth. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.327

And himself believed, and his whole house.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.328

This second miracle Jesus did, when he had come out of Judea into Galilee.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,4,40J.329

<P_5,1J>

After these things there was a feast of the Jews;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.331

and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.332

Now there is at Jerusalem, by the $sheep-gate {COM:gate_in_italics},
a pool, which is called in the Hebrew <font> tongue <$$font> Bethesda,
having five porches.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.333

In these lay a <bracket> great <$$bracket> multitude of infirm persons ,
of blind, lame, withered, <bracket> looking for the moving of the water.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.334

For at a certain season an angel went down into the pool,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.335

and troubled the water: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.336

whosoever therefore went in first, after the troubling of the
water, was made well, whatever disease he had.  <$$bracket>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.337

And a certain man was there, that had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.338

When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time
<font> afflicted, <$$font> he saith unto him;"Dost thou desire to be
made well? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.339

The infirm man answered him;"Sir, I have no man, when the water is
troubled, to put me into the pool: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.340

but while I am coming, another goeth down before me. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.341

Jesus saith unto him;"Rise, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.342

take up thy couch, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.343

and walk. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.344

And immediately the man was made well, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.345

and took up his couch, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.346

and walked.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.347

Now on that day was the sabbath.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.348

The Jews therefore said to him that was cured;"It is the sabbath:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.349

it is not lawful for thee to take up <font> thy <$$font> couch.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.350

He answered them; He who made me well, himself said unto me;"Take up
thy couch, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.351

and walk. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.352

Then they asked him;"What man is that who said unto thee,'Take up thy
couch, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.353

and walk? '"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.354

But he that was cured knew not who it was: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.355

for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <font> that
<$$font> place.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.356

Afterward Jesus meeteth with him in the temple,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.357

and said unto him;"Behold, thou art made well: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.358

sin no more, lest some worse thing befal thee. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.359

The man departed, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.360

and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.361

And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done these things
on the sabbath.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.362

But Jesus said unto them;"My Father worketh until now;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.363

and I <font> also <$$font> work. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.364

Wherefore for this the Jews sought the more to kill him; because he
not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,
making himself like God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.365

Jesus therefore spake NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.366

and said unto them;"Verily verily I say unto you, The Son can do nothing
of himself; but what he seeth the Father do: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.367

for what things <font> the Father <$$font> doeth, these the Son also
doeth in like manner.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,1J.368

<P_5,20J>

For the Father loveth the Son, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.370

and sheweth him all things which he himself doeth:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.371

and he will shew him greater works than these, so that ye will wonder.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.372

For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth <font> them
<$$font> life; so the Son likewise giveth life to whom he will.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.373

For neither doth the Father judge any man: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.374

but hath committed all judgement to the Son; that all may honour the Son,
as they honour the Father.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.375

He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father who sent him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.376

Verily verily I say unto you, He that hearkeneth to my words
, and believeth in him who sent me, hath everlasting life,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.377

and shall not come into condemnation, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.378

but passeth from death to life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.379

Verily verily I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead
shall hear the voice of the Son of God; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.380

and they that hear shall live.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.381

For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son also
to have life in himself: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.382

and he hath given him authority to exercise judgement also, because he
is the Son of man.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.383

Wonder not at this: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.384

for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the sepulchres shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection
of condemnation.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.385

Of myself I can do nothing: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.386

as I hear, I judge: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.387

and my judgement is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will
of him who sent me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.388

If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.389

There is another who beareth witness of me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.390

and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.391

Ye sent unto John, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.392

and he bare witness to the truth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.393

Yet I receive not witness from man: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.394

but I say these things, that ye may be saved.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.395

He was a burning and shining lamp: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.396

and ye were willing to rejoice for a time in his light.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.397

But I have greater witness than <font> that <$$font> of John:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.398

for the works which the Father hath given me to perform, these
works which I do, bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.399

And the Father himself, who sent me, hath borne witness of me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.400

Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.401

And ye have not his word abiding in you: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.402

for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.403

"Search the scriptures; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.404

for in them ye think that ye have everlasting life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.405

and they bear witness of me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,20J.406

<P_5,40J>

and yet ye are not willing to come unto me, that ye may have life.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.408

I receive not honour from men: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.409

but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.410

I am come in my Father's name, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.411

and yet ye receive me not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.412

if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.413

How can Ye believe, who receive honour from one another, and seek
not the honour which <font> cometh <$$font> from the only God?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.414

Think not that I will accuse you to the Father:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.415

there is <font> one <$$font> that accuseth you, <font> even <$$font>
Moses, in whom ye trust.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.416

For if ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed me:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.417

for he wrote of me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.418

But if ye believe not his writings, how will ye believe my words?
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,5,40J.419

<P_6,1J>

After these things Jesus went over the lake of Galilee, which is <font>
the lake <$$font> of Tiberias.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.421

And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which
he did on those who were diseased.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.422

And Jesus went up a mountain, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.423

and sat there with his disciples.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.424

Now the passover, <paren> a feast of the Jews, <$$paren> was nigh.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.425

When Jesus then lifted up <font> his <$$font> eyes, and saw that a great
multitude was coming to him, he saith to Philip;"Whence shall we buy
bread, that these may eat? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.426

<paren> Now he said this to try him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.427

for he himself knew what he was about to do.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.428

Philip answered him;"Bread, worth two hundred denarii, is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.429

One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him;
"There is a child here, that hath five barley-loaves, and two fishes:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.430

but what are They among so many? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.431

And Jesus said;"Make the men place themselves on the ground.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.432

<paren> Now there was much grass in the place.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.433

So the men placed themselves on the ground, in number about five thousand.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.434

And Jesus took the loaves; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.435

and, when he had given thanks, he distributed <bracket> to the
disciples, and the disciples <$$bracket> to those that were on the
ground: and in like manner of the fishes, as much as they would.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.436

And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples;"
Gather the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.437

They therefore gathered <font> them, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.438

and filled twelve panniers with the fragments of the five barley-loaves,
which remained to those that had eaten.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.439

Then those men, when they had seen the miracle which Jesus did,
said ;"This is in truth that prophet who was to come into the world.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.440

When Jesus therefore perceived that they were about to come and take him
by force, to make him a king, he withdrew <bracket> again <$$bracket>
to a mountain himself alone.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.441

And when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.442

and entered into a ship, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.443

and went over the lake toward Capernaum.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.444

And it was now dark; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.445

and Jesus was not come to them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.446

And the lake rose, because of a great wind which blew.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.447

So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs,
they see Jesus walking on the lake, and drawing near to the ship:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.448

and they were afraid.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,1J.449

<P_6,20J>

But he saith unto them;"It is I: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.451

be not afraid. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.452

Then they were glad to receive him into the ship:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.453

and immediately the ship was at the land whither they were going.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.454

The day following, when the multitude who stood on the other side of the
lake saw that there was none other boat there but one, and that Jesus had
not gone with his disciples into the ship, but <font> that <$$font> his
disciples had departed alone; <paren> however there came other boats from
Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread, after the Lord had given
thanks; <$$paren> when the people therefore saw that neither Jesus was
there, nor his disciples, they took shipping, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.455

and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.456

And when they had found him on the other side of the lake, they said
unto him;"Master, when camest thou hither? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.457

Jesus answered them NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.458

and said;"Verily verily I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye
have seen miracles, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.459

Work not so much for the food which perisheth, as for the food which
endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.460

for him hath the Father sealed, <font> even <$$font> God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.461

They said therefore unto him;"What shall we do, that we may work the
works of God? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.462

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.463

and said unto them;"This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom
he hath sent. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.464

Then they said unto him;"What miracle <bracket> therefore <$$bracket>
doest thou, that we may see <font> it, <$$font> and believe in thee?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.465

what dost thou work?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.466

Our fathers ate manna in the desert: as it is written,'
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.467

He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.468

Jesus <bracket> therefore <$$bracket> said unto them; Verily
verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not the bread from heaven;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.469

but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.470

For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth
life to the world. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.471

Then they said unto him;"Master, always give us this bread.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.472

And Jesus said unto them;"I am the bread of life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.473

he who cometh to me, shall never hunger; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.474

and he who believeth in me, shall never thirst.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.475

But I have said unto you, that ye have both seen me and believe not.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.476

All whom the Father giveth me, will come to me;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.477

and him who cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.478

For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will
of him who sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.479

And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all whom he hath
given me I should lose none, but should raise them up at the last day.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,20J.480

<P_6,40J>

For this is the will of him who sent me, that every one who
seeth the Son, and believeth in him, may have everlasting life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.482

and him I will raise up at the last day. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.483

The Jews then murmured at him, because he said;'I am the bread which
came down from heaven:'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.484

and said;"Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother
we know?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.485

how therefore doth this man say,'I came down from heaven? '
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.486

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.487

and said unto them;"Murmur not among yourselves.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.488

No man can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.489

and him I will raise up at the last day.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.490

It is written in the prophets;'And all shall be taught of God.
'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.491

Every one that hath heard and learned from the Father, cometh unto me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.492

Not that any <font> man <$$font> hath seen the Father,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.493

but he that is from God; he hath seen the Father.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.494

Verily verily I say unto you, He who believeth in me, hath everlasting
life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.495

I am the bread of life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.496

Your fathers ate manna in the desert, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.497

and died.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.498

This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of
it, and not die.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.499

I am the living bread which came down from heaven:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.500

if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.501

and the bread which I will give, is my flesh which I will give for the
life of the world. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.502

The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying;" How can this man
give us <font> his <$$font> flesh to eat? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.503

Jesus therefore said unto them;"Verily verily I say unto you, Unless ye
eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have not life
in you.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.504

He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.505

and him I will raise up at the last day.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.506

For my flesh is truly food, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.507

and my blood is truly drink.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.508

He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I
in him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.509

As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he
likewise that eateth me, shall live by me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.510

This is the bread which came down from heaven: not as <bracket>
your <$$bracket> fathers ate <bracket> manna, <$$bracket> and died.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.511

He that eateth of this bread, shall live for ever. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.512

He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,40J.513

<P_6,60J>

Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <font> him, <$$font>
said;"This is hard doctrine: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.515

who can understand it? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.516

But when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured
at this, he said unto them;"Doth this cause you to offend?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.517

<font> What <$$font> then if ye shall see the Son of man going up where
he was before?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.518

It is the spirit that giveth life; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.519

the flesh profiteth nothing: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.520

the words which I speak unto you, <font> they <$$font> are spirit,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.521

and <font> they <$$font> are life.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.522

But there are some of you that believe not. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.523

<paren> For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not
, and who was to deliver him up.  <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.524

Then he said;"For this cause I said unto you, that none can come unto me,
unless it be given unto him by my Father. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.525

From that <font> time <$$font> many of his disciples went back,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.526

and walked no more with him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.527

Jesus therefore said to the twelve;"Will Ye also depart? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.528

Simon Peter answered him;"Master, to whom shall we go?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.529

thou hast the words of everlasting life: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.530

and we believe, and know, that thou art the Holy One of God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.531

Jesus answered them;"Have not I chosen you twelve?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.532

and yet one of you is a false accuser. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.533

Now he spake of Judas Iscariot, <font> the son <$$font> of Simon:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.534

for he was about to deliver him up, <bracket> being <$$bracket> one of
the Twelve.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,6,60J.535

<P_7,1J>

And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.537

for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.538

Now the feast of the Jews, <font> called <$$font> the feast of
tabernacles, was near.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.539

His brethren therefore said unto him;"Depart hence,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.540

and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see the works which
thou doest.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.541

For no man doeth any thing in secret, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.542

and <font> yet <$$font> he himself seeketh to be known publickly.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.543

If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.544

<paren> For neither did his brethren believe in him.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.545

<bracket> Then <$$bracket> Jesus saith unto them;"My time is not yet
come: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.546

but your time is always ready.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.547

The world $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hate You; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.548

but Me it hateth, because I testify of it that its works are evil.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.549

Go Ye up to this feast: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.550

I go not up <font> now <$$font> to this feast; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.551

for my time is not yet fully come. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.552

When he had said these words unto them, he <font> still <$$font> remained
in Galilee.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.553

But when his brethren had gone up, then he also went up to the
feast; not openly, but as <font> it were <$$font> in secret.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.554

Then the Jews sought him at the feast, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.555

and said;"Where is he? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.556

And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.557

and some said;"He is a good man:"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.558

others said;"No: but he deceiveth the people. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.559

However no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.560

But <font> when it was <$$font> now about the midst of the feast, Jesus
went up into the temple, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.561

and taught.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.562

And the Jews wondered, saying;"How hath this man learning, having never
been taught? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.563

Jesus answered them NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.564

and said;"My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.565

If any man desire to do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine,
whether it be from God, or <font> whether <$$font> I speak of myself.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.566

Whoever speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.567

but whoever seeketh his glory who sent him, he is true,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.568

and unrighteousness is not in him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.569

Did not Moses give you the law; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.570

and <font> yet <$$font> none of you keepeth the law?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.571

why seek ye to kill me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,1J.572

<P_7,20J>

The multitude answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.574

and said;"Thou hast a demon: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.575

who seeketh to kill thee? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.576

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.577

and said unto them;"I have done one work, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.578

and ye all wonder at it.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.579

Moses gave you circumcision; <paren> not that it is from Moses, but from
the fathers; <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.580

and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.581

If a man on the sabbath receive circumcision, that the law of Moses may
not be broken; are ye angry with me, because I made a man altogether
well on the sabbath.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.582

Judge not according to appearance; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.583

but judge righteous judgement. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.584

Then some inhabitants of Jerusalem said;"Is not this he whom they seek
to kill?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.585

but, lo, he speaketh boldly; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.586

and nothing is said unto him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.587

Do the rulers know indeed that this is the Christ?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.588

However, we know whence this man is: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.589

but, when Christ cometh, none knoweth whence he is. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.590

Then Jesus cried out in the temple, as he taught, saying;"Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.591

and yet I am not come of myself, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.592

but he who sent me is true, whom ye know not.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.593

<font> But <$$font> I know him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.594

for I am from him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.595

and he hath sent me. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.596

Then the <font> Jews <$$font> sought to apprehend him:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.597

yet no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.598

But many of the multitude believed in him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.599

and said;"When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than <bracket>
these <$$bracket> which this <font> man <$$font> hath done.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.600

The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring such things about him;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.601

and the Pharisees and the chief-priests sent officers to apprehend him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.602

Jesus therefore said;"Yet a little time <font> longer <$$font> I shall
be with you; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.603

and <font> then <$$font> I shall go to him who sent me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.604

Ye will seek me, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.605

and will not find <font> me <$$font>; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.606

and where I shall be, <font> thither <$$font> ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
come. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.607

The Jews therefore said among themselves;"Whither will this man go,
that we shall not find him?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.608

will he go to the dispersed Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.609

What words are these which he said;'Ye will seek me, and will not find
<font> me <$$font>: and where I shall be, <font> thither <$$font> ye
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} come? '"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.610

Now on the last day, <font> which is <$$font> the great <font> day,
<$$font> of the feast, Jesus stood NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.611

and cried out, saying;"If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.612

He who believeth in me, as the scripture hath said, from his belly shall
flow rivers of living water. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.613

<paren> Now he spake this of the Spirit, which those who believe in him
were to receive: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.614

for the <bracket> Holy <$$bracket> Spirit was not yet <font>
given, <$$font> because Jesus was not yet glorified.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,20J.615

<P_7,40J>

Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said;
"In truth this is a prophet. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.617

Others said;"This is the Christ. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.618

But others said;"Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.619

Hath not the scripture said, that the Christ cometh of the offspring
of David, and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.620

So there was a division among the multitude because of him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.621

And some of them desired to apprehend him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.622

but none laid hands on him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.623

Then the officers came to the chief-priests and Pharisees who said unto
them;"Why have ye not brought him? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.624

The officers answered,"Never man spake like this <bracket> man.
<$$bracket>"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.625

Then the Pharisees answered them;"Are Ye also deceived?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.626

Hath any <font> one <$$font> of the rulers or of the Pharisees, believed
in him?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.627

but this multitude, who know not the law, are accursed. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.628

Nicodemus saith unto them, <paren> he that came to <font> Jesus <$$font>
by night, being one of them, <$$paren>"Doth our law judge any man, unless
it first hear him, and know what he doeth?  "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.629

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.630

and said unto him;"Art Thou also of Galilee?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.631

Search NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.632

and see, that a prophet is not to arise from Galilee. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.633

<bracket> Then every man went to his own house:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,7,40J.634

<P_8,1J>

but Jesus went to the mount of Olives.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.636

And early in the morning he came again into the temple,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.637

and all the people came to him; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.638

and he sat down NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.639

and taught them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.640

And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery
: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.641

and when they had set her in the midst, they say unto him; "Master, this
woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.642

Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.643

what then sayest Thou? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.644

Now they said this, trying him; that they might have <font> whereof
<$$font> to accuse him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.645

But Jesus stooped down, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.646

and with <font> his <$$font> finger wrote on the ground.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.647

But when they continued asking him, he raised himself up,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.648

and said unto them;"Let him that is without sin among you, first cast
a stone at her. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.649

And he again stooped down, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.650

and wrote on the ground.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.651

But they, having heard <font> this, <$$font> and being convicted by <font>
their <$$font> conscience, went out one by one, having begun at the elder,
to the last: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.652

and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.653

Now when Jesus raised himself up, and saw none but the woman, he said unto
her;"Woman, where are those thine accusers?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.654

hath no man condemned thee? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.655

And she said;"No man, Sir. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.656

And Jesus said unto her;"Neither do I condemn thee:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.657

go, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.658

and sin no more. "<$$bracket> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.659

Then Jesus spake again unto them, saying;"I am the light of the world:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.660

he who followeth me, shall by no means walk in darkness,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.661

but shall have the light of life. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.662

The Pharisees therefore said unto him;"Thou bearest witness of thyself ;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.663

thy witness is not true. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.664

Jesus answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.665

and said unto them;"Though I bear witness of myself, <font> yet <$$font>
my witness is true: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.666

for I know whence I came, and whither I go; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.667

but ye know not whence I come, and whither I go.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.668

Ye judge according to the flesh: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.669

I judge no one.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.670

And yet if I judge, my judgement is true: because I am not alone, but
I and the Father who sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.671

It is written in your law also, that the witness of two men is true.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.672

I bear witness of myself; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.673

and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.674

They said therefore unto him;"Where is thy Father? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.675

Jesus answered;"Ye neither know me, nor my Father:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.676

if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,1J.677

<P_8,20J>

<font> Jesus <$$font> spake these words in the treasury, as he was
teaching in the temple: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.679

and yet none laid hands on him; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.680

for his hour was not yet come.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.681

Then Jesus said unto them again;"I <font> shall <$$font> depart,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.682

and ye will seek me, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.683

and will die in your sin: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.684

whither I depart, ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.685

Then the Jews said;"Will he kill himself?  because he saith ,'Whither
I depart, ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come. '" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.686

And he said unto them;"Ye are of those beneath;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.687

I am of those above: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.688

ye are of this world; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.689

I am not of this world.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.690

I therefore said unto you, that ye will die in your sins:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.691

for if ye believe not that I am <font> he, <$$font> ye will die in your
sins. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.692

Then they said unto him;"Who art thou? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.693

<bracket> And <$$bracket> Jesus said unto them;"Even what I told you
at first.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.694

I have many things to say concerning you, and to condemn:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.695

but he who sent me, is true; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.696

and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.697

They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.698

Then Jesus said unto them;"When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then
ye will know that I am <font> he, <$$font> and <font> that <$$font> I do
nothing of myself; but speak these things as my Father hath taught me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.699

And he who sent me is with me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.700

the Father hath not left me alone; because I always do those things
which please him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.701

As he spake these words, many believed in him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.702

Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him;"If ye continue
in my word, <font> then, <$$font> ye are truly my disciples:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.703

and ye shall know the truth, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.704

and the truth shall make you free. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.705

<font> Some <$$font> answered him;"We are Abraham's offspring,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.706

and were never slaves to any man: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.707

how sayest thou,'Ye shall become free? '" NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.708

Jesus answered them;"Verily verily I say unto you, Whosoever committeth
sin, is the slave of sin.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.709

And the slave abideth not in the house for ever:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.710

<font> but <$$font> the son abideth for ever.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.711

If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye will be free indeed.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.712

I know that ye are Abraham's offspring: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.713

yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.714

I speak that which I have seen with <bracket> my <$$bracket> Father:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.715

and ye do that which ye have seen with <bracket> your <$$bracket> father.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.716

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.717

and said unto him;"Abraham is our father. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.718

Jesus saith unto them;"If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the
works of Abraham.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,20J.719

<P_8,40J>

But now ye seek to kill me, a man that have spoken to you the truth,
which I have heard from God: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.721

Abraham did not act thus.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.722

Ye do the works of your father. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.723

Then they said to him. "We are not born of fornication:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.724

we have one Father, <font> even <$$font> God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.725

Jesus said unto them;"If God were your Father, ye would love me:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.726

for I came forth from God, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.727

and come <font> unto you; <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.728

for I came not of myself, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.729

but He sent me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.730

Why do ye not understand my discourse?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.731

because ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hearken to my words.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.732

Ye are of <font> your <$$font> father the devil;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.733

and the desires of your father ye are disposed to do.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.734

He was a slayer of men from the beginning, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.735

and continued not in the truth; because there is no truth in him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.736

When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.737

for he is a liar, and the father of liars.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.738

And because I speak the truth, ye believe me not.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.739

Which of you convicteth me of sin?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.740

If I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.741

He that is of God, hearkeneth to God's words: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.742

ye therefore hearken not, because ye are not of God. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.743

The Jews answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.744

and said unto him;"Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast
a demon? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.745

Jesus answered;"I have not a demon: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.746

but I honour my Father, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.747

and ye dishonour me.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.748

But I seek not mine own glory: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.749

there is one who seeketh <font> it, <$$font> and judgeth,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.750

Verily verily I say unto you; If a man keep my words, he shall never
see death. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.751

The Jews therefore said unto him;"Now we know that thou hast a demon.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.752

Abraham is dead, and the prophets <font> also: <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.753

yet thou sayest;'If a man keep my words, he shall never taste of
death. 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.754

Art thou greater than our father Abraham, that is dead?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.755

and the prophets are dead <font> also: <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.756

whom makest thou thyself? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.757

Jesus answered;"If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.758

it is my Father who glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.759

and yet ye know him not; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.760

but I know him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.761

and if I should say,'I know him not,'I should speak falsely, like you:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.762

but I know him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.763

and keep his words.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.764

Your father Abraham earnestly desired that he might see my day:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.765

and he saw <font> it, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.766

and was glad,"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.767

The Jews therefore said unto him;"Thou art not yet fifty years old;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.768

and hast thou seen Abraham? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.769

Jesus said unto them;"Verily verily I say unto you, Before Abraham was
born, I am. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.770

Then they took up stones to cast at him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.771

but Jesus concealed himself, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.772

and went out of the temple.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,8,40J.773

<P_9,1J>

And as he passed by, he saw a man <font> that had been <$$font> blind
from <font> his <$$font> birth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.775

And his disciples asked him, saying;"Master, who sinned, this man,
or his parents, that he was born blind? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.776

Jesus answered;"Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the
works of God might be manifested in him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.777

I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.778

the night cometh, when no man can work.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.779

While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.780

When he had said this, he spat on the ground, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.781

and made clay of the spittle, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.782

and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.783

and said unto him;"Go, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.784

wash thyself in the pool of Siloam:"<paren> which is, by interpretation,
Sent.  <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.785

He departed therefore, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.786

and washed himself, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.787

and came seeing.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.788

The neighbours therefore, and those who had seen him before, <paren>
for he had been a beggar, <$$paren> said;"Is not this he who sat and
begged? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.789

Some said;"This is he. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.790

And others <font> said; <$$font>"He is like him. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.791

<font> But <$$font> He said;"I am <font> he <$$font>. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.792

They said therefore unto him;"How were thine eyes opened? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.793

He answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.794

and said;"A man, called Jesus, made clay, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.795

and anointed mine eyes, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.796

and said unto me;'Go to Siloam, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.797

and wash thyself:'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.798

and I went NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.799

and washed myself, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.800

and received my sight. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.801

Then they said unto him;"Where is he? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.802

He saith;"I know not. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.803

<font> Then <$$font> they bring him to the Pharisees; him, <font> I say,
<$$font> who before was blind.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.804

Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.805

Then the Pharisees also asked him again, how he had received his sight.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.806

And he said unto them;"He put clay on mine eyes,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.807

and I washed myself, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.808

and see. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.809

Wherefore some of the Pharisees said;"This man is not from God, because
he keepeth not the sabbath. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.810

Others said;"How can a sinner do such miracles? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.811

And there was a division among them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.812

They say again to the blind man;"What sayest Thou of him, since he hath
opened thine eyes? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.813

And <font> the blind man <$$font> said;"He is a prophet. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.814

Upon this the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
blind , and had received his sight, until they called his parents:
<font> the parents, I say, <$$font> of him that had received his sight.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.815

And they asked them, saying;"Is this your son, of whom ye say that he
was born blind?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.816

how then doth he now see? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,1J.817

<P_9,20J>

His parents answered them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.819

and said;"We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.820

but by what means he now seeth, we know not; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.821

or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.822

he is of age; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.823

ask Him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.824

he will speak for himself. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.825

His parents spake these words, because they feared the Jews:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.826

for the Jews had already agreed that, if any man should confess <font>
Jesus <$$font> to be <font> the <$$font> Christ, he should be put out
of the synagogue.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.827

For this cause his parents said;"He is of age;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.828

ask him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.829

A second time therefore they called the man that had been blind,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.830

and said unto him;"Give glory to God: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.831

we know that this man is a sinner. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.832

<bracket> Then <$$bracket> he answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.833

and said;"Whether he be a sinner, I know not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.834

one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, I now see. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.835

Then they said to him again;"What did he to thee?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.836

how opened he thine eyes? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.837

He answered them;"I have told you already, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.838

and ye did not hearken: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.839

why desire ye to hear <font> it <$$font> again?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.840

would Ye also be his disciples? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.841

<font> Then <$$font> they reviled him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.842

and said;"Thou art his disciple; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.843

but We are disciples of Moses.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.844

We know that God spake to Moses: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.845

but we know not whence this man is. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.846

The man answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.847

and said unto them;"In this now is a wonderful thing, that
ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.848

Now we know that God heareth not sinners: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.849

but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.850

From the beginning of the world, it hath not been heard that any man
opened the eyes of one born blind.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.851

If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.852

They answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.853

and said unto him;"Thou wast altogether born in sins,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.854

and dost Thou teach Us? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.855

And they cast him out <font> of their synagogues.  <$$font>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.856

Jesus heard that they had cast him out: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.857

and, when he met him, he said unto him;"Dost thou believe in the Son of
God? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.858

He answered NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.859

and said;"Who is he, Sir, that I may believe in him? "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.860

And Jesus said unto him;"Thou hast both seen him,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.861

and it is he who talketh with thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.862

And <font> the man <$$font> said;"Sir, I believe. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.863

And he did <font> Jesus <$$font> obeisance.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.864

Then Jesus said;"For judgement I am come into this world: that those
who see not, may see; and that those who see, may become blind.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,20J.865

<P_9,40J>

And <font> some <$$font> of the Pharisees that were with him, heard
these words, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.867

and said unto him;"Are We also blind? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.868

Jesus said unto them;"If ye were blind, ye would not have sin:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.869

but now ye say,'We see:'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.870

your sin therefore remaineth.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,9,40J.871

<P_10,1J>

Verily verily I say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into
the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, that man is a thief and
a robber.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.873

But he that entereth in by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.874

To him the porter openeth; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.875

and the sheep hearken to his voice: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.876

and he calleth his own sheep by name, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.877

and leadeth them out.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.878

And when he bringeth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.879

and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.  Whereas a stranger
they will not follow, but will flee from him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.880

for they know not the voice of strangers. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.881

This parable Jesus spake unto them: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.882

but they understood not what things they were, which he spake unto them.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.883

Jesus therefore said unto them again;"Verily verily I say unto you,
I am the door of the sheep.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.884

All that have come <bracket> before me <$$bracket> are thieves and
robbers: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.885

but the sheep did not hear them.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.886

I am the door: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.887

by me if any enter in, he shall be safe, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.888

and shall go in and out, and find pasture.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.889

The thief cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.890

I am come that <font> the Sheep <$$font> may have life, and that they
may have it abundantly.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.891

I am the good shepherd: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.892

the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.893

But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep
are not, seeth the wolf coming, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.894

and leaveth the sheep, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.895

and fleeth; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.896

and the wolf seizeth them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.897

and scattereth the sheep: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.898

and the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for
the sheep.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.899

I am the good shepherd, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.900

and know my <font> sheep, <$$font> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.901

and am known by mine; <font> even <$$font> as the Father knoweth me,
and <font> as <$$font> I know the Father: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.902

and I lay down my life for the sheep.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.903

And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.904

them also I must bring, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.905

and they will hear my voice; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.906

and there shall be one flock, <font> and <$$font> one shepherd.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.907

For this my Father loveth me; because I lay down my life, that I may
take it again.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.908

None taketh it from me; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.909

but I lay it down of myself.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.910

I have power to lay it down, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.911

and I have power to take it again.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.912

This commission I have received from my Father. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.913

There was a division therefore again among the Jews because of these
words.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,1J.914

<P_10,20J>

And many of them said;"He hath a demon, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.916

and is mad; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.917

why hear ye him? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.918

Others said;"These are not the words of him that hath a demon.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.919

Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.920

Now the feast of Dedication was kept at Jerusalem;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.921

and it was winter.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.922

And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.923

Then the Jews surrounded him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.924

and said unto him;"How long dost thou keep us in suspence?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.925

If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.926

Jesus answered them;"I have told you, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.927

and ye believe not: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.928

the works which I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.929

But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.930

As I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.931

and I know them, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.932

and they follow me: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.933

and I give unto them everlasting life; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.934

and they shall never perish, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.935

nor shall any one snatch them out of mine hand.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.936

My Father, that hath given <font> them <$$font> to me, is greater than
all; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.937

and none is able to snatch <font> them <$$font> out of my Father's hand.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.938

I and the Father are one. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.939

Then the Jews took up stones again, to stone him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.940

Jesus said to them;"Many good works I have shewn you from my Father:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.941

for which of those works do ye stone me? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.942

The Jews answered him, <bracket> saying; <$$bracket> For a good work
we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man,
makest thyself God.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.943

Jesus answered them;"Is it not written in your law,'I said, Ye are
gods? 'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.944

If those be called gods, to whom the word of God came, <paren> and the
scripture $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be made void; <$$paren> say ye of
him, whom the Father hath set apart, and sent into the world,'Thou
blasphemest:'because I said,'I am <font> the <$$font> Son of God?
'NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.945

If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.946

but if I do <font> them, <$$font> though ye believe not Me, believe the
works: that ye may know and believe that the Father <font> is <$$font>
in me, and I in him;"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.947

Upon this they sought again to apprehend him:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.948

but he escaped out of their hand; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,20J.949

<P_10,40J>

and departed again beyond Jordan, to the place where John at first
baptized: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.951

and there he abode.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.952

And many resorted to him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.953

and said;"John did no miracle: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.954

but all things which John spake of this man were true. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.955

And many believed in him there.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,10,40J.956

<P_11,1J>

Now a certain man was sick, <font> named <$$font> Lazarus, of Bethany,
the town of Mary and of her sister Martha.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.958

<paren> Now it was <font> the same <$$font> Mary that anointed the Lord
with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus
was sick.  <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.959

His sisters therefore sent to <font> Jesus, <$$font> saying;"Master,
behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.960

And when Jesus heard <font> it, <$$font> he said;"This sickness is
not unto death; but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be
glorified by it. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.961

<paren> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her siser, and Lazarus.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.962

When he heard therefore that <font> Lazarus <$$font> was sick, he still
abode two days in the place where he was.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.963

Then afterward he saith to <font> his <$$font> disciples;"Let us go
again into Judea. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.964

<font> His <$$font> disciples say unto him;"Master, <font> but <$$font>
now the Jews sought to stone thee: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.965

and goest thou thither again? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.966

Jesus answered;"Are there not twelve hours of the day?
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.967

If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light
of this world: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.968

but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth; because the light is not
in him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.969

He spake these things; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.970

and afterward he saith unto them;"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.971

but I go that I may awake him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.972

Then his disciples said;"Master, if he sleep, he will recover.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.973

But Jesus spake of his death: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.974

yet they thought that he was speaking of rest in sleep.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.975

Then Jesus said to them plainly;"Lazarus is dead.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.976

And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that ye may believe:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.977

but let us go to him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.978

Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples:"Let
Us also go, that we may die with him. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.979

When Jesus therefore came, he found that <font> Lazarus <$$font> had
already lain four days in the sepulchre.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.980

<paren> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.981

and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, that they might comfort
them concerning their brother.  <$$paren> NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,1J.982

<P_11,20J>

Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, <font> went
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.984

and <$$font> met him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.985

but Mary sat in the house.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.986

Then said Martha to Jesus;"Master, if thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.987

But I know that, even now, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will
give thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.988

Jesus saith unto her;"Thy brother shall rise again. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.989

Martha saith unto him;"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection
at the last day. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.990

Jesus said unto her;"I am the resurrection, and the life:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.991

he who believeth in me, though he die, yet he shall live:
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.992

and whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.993

Believest thou this? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.994

She saith unto him;"Yes, Master, I believe that thou art the
Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.995

And when she had said this, she went NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.996

and called her sister Mary secretly, saying;"The Master is come and
calleth for thee. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.997

As soon as <font> Mary <$$font> heard <font> this, <$$font> she riseth
quickly, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.998

and cometh to him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.999

<paren> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1000

but was in the place where Martha met him.  <$$paren>
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1001

The Jews then, who were with Mary in the house, and were comforting
her, when they saw that she rose up hastily, and went out, followed
her, saying;"She goeth to the sepulchre, that she may weep there.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1002

As soon then as Mary came where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at
his feet, saying unto him;"Master, if thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1003

When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews <font>
also <$$font> weeping who came with her, he groaned in spirit,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1004

and was troubled, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1005

and said;"Where have ye laid him? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1006

They say unto him;"Master, come and see. " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1007

Jesus wept.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1008

The Jews therefore said;"See, how he loved him. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1009

But some of them said;"Could not He, that opened the eyes of the blind
man, have caused even that this <font> Lazarus <$$font> should not have
died. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1010

Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1011

Now it was a cave, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1012

and a stone lay against it.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1013

Jesus saith;"Take away the stone. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1014

Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him;"Master, by this
time he stinketh: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1015

for he hath been <font> buried <$$font> four days. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,20J.1016

<P_11,40J>

Jesus saith unto her;"Said I not unto thee that, if thou wouldest believe,
thou shouldest see the glory of God? " NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1018

Then they took away the stone.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1019

And Jesus lifted up <font> his <$$font> eyes,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1020

and said,"Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1021

I know indeed that thou hearest me always: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1022

but because of the multitude who stand by I have said <font>
this, <$$font> that they may believe that thou hast sent me. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1023

And when he had said these words, he cried out with a loud voice;
"Lazarus, come forth. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1024

<bracket> And <$$bracket> he that had been, dead came out, having his
hands and feet bound with grave-clothes: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1025

and his face was bound about with a napkin.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1026

Jesus saith unto them;"Loose him, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1027

and let him go. "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1028

Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things
which Jesus did, believed in him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1029

But some of them went away to the Pharisees,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1030

and told them what things Jesus had done.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1031

The chief-priests therefore and the Pharisees assembled a council,
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1032

and said;"What shall we do?  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1033

for this man doeth many miracles.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1034

If we suffer him <font> to go on <$$font> thus, all <font> men <$$font>
will believe in him: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1035

and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.
"NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1036

Then one of them, <font> named <$$font> Caiaphas, being high-priest that
year, said unto them;"Ye know nothing; NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1037

nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die
for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish. "
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1038

Now he spake not this of himself: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1039

but, being high-priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die
for that nation: and <font> indeed <$$font> not for that nation only;
but that he should gather together also in one the children of God,
who were scattered abroad.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1040

From that day therefore they took counsel together to kill him.
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1041

Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1042

but went thence to a country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim;
NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1043

and continued there with his disciples.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1044

And the passover of the Jews was near: NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1045

and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover,
to purify themselves.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1046

Then they sought for Jesus, NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1047

and said among themselves, as they stood in the temple,"What think ye ?
that he will not come to the feast? "NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1048

Now both the chief-priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment ,
that, if any man knew where he was, he should discover <font> it <$$font>;
that they might apprehend him.  NEWCOME-NEW-1796-1,11,40J.1049
