Second Essay OWEN-1813-2,1,41.3

<$$heading>

<font> The Principles of the Former Essay continued, and applied in part
to Practice <$$font> OWEN-1813-2,1,41.5

{COM:epigraph_omitted}

General principles only were developed in the First Essay.
OWEN-1813-2,1,41.7

In this an attempt will be made to show the advantages which may be
derived from the adoption of those principles into practice, and to
explain the mode by which the practice may, without inconvenience,
be generally introduced.  OWEN-1813-2,1,41.8

Some of the most important benefits to be derived from the introduction of
those principles into practice are, that they will create the most cogent
reasons to induce each man'to have charity for <font> all <$$font> men'.
OWEN-1813-2,1,41.9

No feeling short of this can indeed find place in any mind which has been
taught clearly to understand that children in all parts of the earth have
been, are, and everlastingly will be, impressed with habits and sentiments
similar to those of their parents and instructors; modified , however,
by the circumstances in which they have been, are, or may be placed,
and by the peculiar organizations of each individual.  OWEN-1813-2,1,41.10

Yet not one of these causes of character is at the command, or in any
manner under the control of infants, who <paren> whatever absurdity we
may have been taught to the contrary <$$paren>, $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
possibly be accountable for the sentiments and manners which may be
given to them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,41.11

And here lies the fundamental error of society; OWEN-1813-2,1,41.12

and from hence have proceeded, and do proceed, most of the miseries
of mankind.  OWEN-1813-2,1,41.13

Children are, without exception, passive and wonderfully contrived
compounds; which, by an accurate previous and subsequent attention,
<font> founded on a correct knowledge of the subject <$$font>, may be
formed collectively to have any human character.  OWEN-1813-2,1,41.14

And although these compounds, like all the other works of nature , possess
endless varieties, yet they partake of that plastic quality, which,
by perseverance under judicious management, may be ultimately moulded
into the very image of rational wishes and desires.  OWEN-1813-2,1,41.15

In the next place these principles $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fail to
create feelings which, <P_1,42> without force or the production of any
counteracting motive, will irresistibly lead those who possess them
to make due allowance for the difference of sentiments and manners
, not only among their friends and countrymen, but also among the
inhabitants of every region of the earth, even including their enemies.
OWEN-1813-2,1,42.16

With this insight into the formation of character, there is no conceivable
foundation for private displeasure or public enmity.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.17

Say, if it be within the sphere of possibility that children can be
trained to attain <font> that <$$font> knowledge, and at the same
time to acquire feelings of enmity towards a single human creature?
OWEN-1813-2,1,42.18

The child who from infancy has been rationally instructed in these
principles, will readily discover and trace <font> whence <$$font>
the opinions and habits of his associates have arisen, and <font> why
<$$font> they possess them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.19

At the same age he will have acquired reason sufficient to exhibit to
him forcibly the irrationality of being angry with an individual for
possessing qualities which, as a passive being during the formation of
those qualities, he had not the means of preventing.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.20

Such are the impressions these principles will make on the mind of every
child so taught; OWEN-1813-2,1,42.21

and, instead of generating anger or displeasure, they will produce
commiseration and pity for those individuals who possess either habits
or sentiments which appear to him to be destructive of their own comfort,
pleasure, or happiness; OWEN-1813-2,1,42.22

and will produce on his part a desire to remove those causes of distress
, OWEN-1813-2,1,42.23

and his own feelings of commiseration and pity may be also removed.
OWEN-1813-2,1,42.24

The pleasure which he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} avoid experiencing by this
mode of conduct will likewise stimulate him to the most active endeavours
to withdraw those circumstances which surround any part of mankind with
causes of misery, and to replace them with others which have a tendency
to increase happiness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.25

He will then also strongly entertain the desire'to do good to <font>
all <$$font> men', and even to those who think themselves his enemies.
OWEN-1813-2,1,42.26

Thus <font> shortly <$$font>, <font> directly <$$font>, and <font>
certainly <$$font> may mankind be taught the essence, and to attain
the ultimate object, of all former <font> moral <$$font> and <font>
religious <$$font> instruction.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.27

These Essays, however, are intended to explain that which is <font>
true <$$font>, and not to attack that which is <font> false.  <$$font>
OWEN-1813-2,1,42.28

For to explain that which is true may permanently improve, without
creating even temporary evil; whereas to attack that which is false,
is often productive of very fatal consequences.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.29

The former convinces the judgement when the mind possesses full and
deliberate powers of judging; OWEN-1813-2,1,42.30

the latter instantly arouses irritation, OWEN-1813-2,1,42.31

and renders the judgement unfit for its office, and useless.
OWEN-1813-2,1,42.32

But why should we <font> ever <$$font> irritate?  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.33

Do not these principles make it so obvious as to place it beyond any
doubt, that even the present irrational ideas and practices prevalent
throughout the world are not to be charged as either a fault or a culpable
error of the existing generation?  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.34

The immediate cause of them was the partial ignorance of our forefathers
, who, although they $acquired {TEXT:acquire} some vague disjointed
knowledge of the principles on which character is formed, could not
discover the connected chain of those principles, and consequently knew
not how to apply them to practice.  OWEN-1813-2,1,42.35

They taught their children that which they had themselves been taught,
that which <P_1,43> they had acquired, OWEN-1813-2,1,43.36

and in so doing they acted like their forefathers; who retained the
established customs of former generations until better and superior were
discovered and made evident to them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,43.37

The present race of men have also instructed their children as they had
been previously instructed, OWEN-1813-2,1,43.38

and are equally unblameable for any defects which their systems contain.
OWEN-1813-2,1,43.39

And however erroneous or injurious that instruction and those systems
may now be proved to be, the principles on which these Essays are founded
will be misunderstood, OWEN-1813-2,1,43.40

and their spirit will be wholly misconceived, if either irritation or
the slightest degree of ill will shall be generated against those who
even tenaciously adhere to the worst parts of that instruction, and
support the most pernicious of those systems.  OWEN-1813-2,1,43.41

For such individuals, sects, or parties have been trained from infancy
to consider it their duty and interest so to act, OWEN-1813-2,1,43.42

and in so acting they merely continue the customs of their predecessors.
OWEN-1813-2,1,43.43

Let truth unaccompanied with <font> error <$$font> be placed before them
; give them time to examine it and to see that it is in unison with all
previously ascertained truths; and conviction and acknowledgement of it
will follow of course.  OWEN-1813-2,1,43.44

It is weakness itself to require assent <font> before <$$font> conviction
; OWEN-1813-2,1,43.45

and <font> afterwards <$$font> it will not be withheld.
OWEN-1813-2,1,43.46

To endeavour to force conclusions without making the subject clear to the
understanding, is most unjustifiable and irrational, OWEN-1813-2,1,43.47

and must prove useless or injurious to the mental faculties.
OWEN-1813-2,1,43.48

In the spirit thus described we therefore proceed in the investigation
of the subject.  OWEN-1813-2,1,43.49

The facts which by the invention of printing have gradually accumulated
now show the errors of the systems of our forefathers so distinctly,
that they must be, when pointed out, evident to all classes of the
community, and render it absolutely necessary that new legislative
measures be immediately adopted to prevent the confusion which must arise
from even the most ignorant being competent to detect the absurdity and
glaring injustice of many of those laws by which they are now governed.
OWEN-1813-2,1,43.50

Such are those laws which enact punishments for a very great variety of
actions designated crimes; while those from whom such actions proceed are
regularly trained to acquire no other knowledge than that which compels
them to conclude that those actions are the best they could perform.
OWEN-1813-2,1,43.51

How much longer shall we continue to allow generation after generation
to be taught crime from their infancy, and, when so taught, hunt them
like beasts of the forest, until they are entangled beyond escape in
the toils and nets of the law?  {COM:sic} when, if the circumstances of
those poor unpitied sufferers had been reversed with those who are even
surrounded with the pomp and dignity of justice, these latter would have
been at the bar of the culprit, and the former would have been in the
judgement seat.  OWEN-1813-2,1,43.52

Had the present Judges of these realms been born and educated among
the poor and profligate of St Giles's or some similar situation, it is
not certain, inasmuch as they possess native energies and abilities,
that ere this they would <P_1,44> have been at the head of their <font>
then <$$font> profession and, in consequence of that superiority and
proficiency, would have already suffered imprisonment, transportation,
or death?  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.53

Can we for a moment hesitate to decide, that if some of those men whom
the laws dispensed by the present Judges have doomed to suffer capital
punishments, had been born, trained, and circumstanced, as these Judges
were born, trained, and circumstanced, that some of those who had so
suffered would have been the identical individuals who would have passed
the same awful sentences on the present highly esteemed dignitaries of
the law?  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.54

If we open our eyes and attentively notice events, we shall observe
these facts to multiply before us.  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.55

Is the evil then of so small magnitude as to be totally disregarded and
passed by as the ordinary occurrences of the day, and as not deserving
of one reflection?  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.56

And shall we be longer told'that the convenient time to attend to
inquiries of this nature is not yet come: that other matters of far
weightier import engage our attention, and it must remain over till a
season of more leisure? 'OWEN-1813-2,1,44.57

To those who may be inclined to think and speak thus, I would say -
'Let feelings of humanity or strict justice induce you to devote a few
hours to visit some of the public prisons of the metropolis, and patiently
inquire, with kind commiserating solicitude, of their various inhabitants,
the events of their lives and the lives of their various connections.
OWEN-1813-2,1,44.58

Then will tales unfold that <font> must <$$font> arrest attention, that
will disclose sufferings, misery, and injustice, upon which, for obvious
reasons, I will not now dwell, but which previously, I am persuaded,
you could not suppose it possible to exist in any civilized state, far
less that they should be permitted for centuries to increase around the
very fountain of British jurisprudence. 'OWEN-1813-2,1,44.59

The true cause, however, of this conduct, so contrary to the general
humanity of the natives of these Islands, is, that a practical remedy
for the evil, on clearly defined and sound principles had not yet been
suggested.  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.60

But the principles developed in this'New View of the Society', <font> will
point out a remedy which is almost simplicity itself, possessing no more
practical difficulties than many of the common employments of life; and
such as are readily overcome by men of very ordinary practical talents.
<$$font> OWEN-1813-2,1,44.61

That such a remedy is easily practicable, may be collected from the
account of the following very partial experiment.  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.62

In the year 1784 the late Mr Dale, of Glasgow, founded a manufactory for
spinning of cotton, near the falls of the Clyde, in the county of Lanark,
in Scotland; OWEN-1813-2,1,44.63

and about that period cotton mills were first introduced into the northern
part of the kingdom.  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.64

It was the power which could be obtained from the falls of water that
induced Mr Dale to erect his mills in this situation; OWEN-1813-2,1,44.65

for in other respects it was not well chosen.  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.66

The country around was uncultivated; OWEN-1813-2,1,44.67

the inhabitants were poor and few in number; OWEN-1813-2,1,44.68

and the roads in the neighbourhood were so bad, that the Falls, now so
celebrated, were then unknown to strangers.  OWEN-1813-2,1,44.69

<P_1,45>

It was therefore necessary to collect a new population to supply the
infant establishment with labourers.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.71

This, however, was no light task; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.72

for all the regularly trained Scotch peasantry disdained the idea
of working early and late, day after day, within cotton mills.
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.73

Two modes then only remained of obtaining these labourers; the one,
to procure children from the various public charities of the country
; and the other, to induce families to settle around the works.
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.74

To accommodate the first, a large house was erected, which ultimately
contained about 500 children, who were procured chiefly from workhouses
and charities in Edinburgh.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.75

These children were to be fed, clothed, and educated; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.76

and these duties Mr Dale performed with the unwearied benevolence which
it is well known he possessed.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.77

To obtain the second, a village was built; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.78

and the houses were let at a low rent to such families as could be
induced to accept employment in the mills; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.79

but such was the general dislike to that occupation at the time, that,
with a few exceptions, only persons destitute of friends, employment, and
character, were found willing to try the experiment; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.80

and of these a sufficient number to supply a constant increase of the
manufactory could not be obtained.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.81

It was therefore deemed a favour on the part even of such individuals
to reside at the village, OWEN-1813-2,1,45.82

and, when taught the business, they grew so valuable to the establishment,
that they became agents not to be governed contrary to their own
inclinations.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.83

Mr Dale's principal avocations were at a distance from the works, which
he seldom visited more than once for a few hours in three or four months
; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.84

he was therefore under the necessity of committing the management
of the establishment to various servants with more or less power.
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.85

Those who have a practical knowledge of mankind will readily anticipate
the character which a population so collected and constituted would
acquire.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.86

It is therefore scarcely necessary to state, that the community by degrees
was formed under these circumstances into a very wretched society :
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.87

every man did that which was right in his own eyes, OWEN-1813-2,1,45.88

and vice and immorality prevailed to a monstrous extent.
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.89

The population lived in idleness, in poverty, in almost every kind
of crime; consequently, in debt, out of health, and in misery.
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.90

Yet to make matters still worse - although the cause proceeded from
the best possible motive, a conscientious adherence to principle - the
whole was under a strong sectarian influence, which gave a marked and
decided preference to one set of religious opinions over all others,
OWEN-1813-2,1,45.91

and the professors of the favoured opinions were the privileged of
the community.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.92

The boarding-house containing the children presented a very different
scene.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.93

The benevolent proprietor spared no expense to give comfort to the
poor children.  OWEN-1813-2,1,45.94

The rooms provided for them were spacious, always clean, and well
ventilated; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.95

the food was abundant, and of the best quality; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.96

the clothes were neat and useful; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.97

a surgeon was kept in constant pay, to direct how to prevent or cure
disease; OWEN-1813-2,1,45.98

and the best instructors which the country afforded were appointed
to teach such branches of education as were deemed likely to <P_1,46>
be useful to children in their situation.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.99

Kind and well-disposed persons were appointed to superintend all their
proceedings.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.100

Nothing, in short, at first sight seemed wanting to render it a most
complete charity.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.101

But to defray the expense of these well-devised arrangements, and to
support the establishment generally, it was absolutely necessary that
the children should be employed within the mills from six o'clock in the
morning till seven in the evening, summer and winter; OWEN-1813-2,1,46.102

and after these hours their education commenced.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.103

The directors of the public charities, from mistaken economy, would not
consent to send the children under their care to cotton mills, unless
the children are received by the proprietors at the ages of six, seven
and eight.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.104

And Mr Dale was under the necessity of accepting them at those ages, or
of stopping the manufactory which he had commenced.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.105

It is not to be supposed that children so young could remain, with the
intervals of meals only, from six in the morning until seven in the
evening, in constant employment, on their feet, within cotton mills, and
afterwards acquire much proficiency in education.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.106

And so it proved; OWEN-1813-2,1,46.107

for many of them became dwarfs in body and mind, OWEN-1813-2,1,46.108

and some of them were deformed.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.109

Their labour through the day and their education at night became so
irksome, that numbers of them continually ran away, and almost all
looked forward with impatience and anxiety to the expiration of their
apprenticeship of seven, eight, and nine years, which generally expired
when they were from thirteen to fifteen years old.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.110

At this period of life, unaccustomed to provide for themselves, and
unacquainted with the world, they usually went to Edinburgh or Glasgow,
where boys and girls were soon assailed by the innumerable temptations
which all large towns present, and to which many of them fell sacrifices.
OWEN-1813-2,1,46.111

Thus Mr Dale's arrangements, and his kind solicitude for the comfort
and happiness of these children, were rendered in their ultimate effect
almost nugatory.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.112

They were hired by him and sent to be employed, OWEN-1813-2,1,46.113

and without their labour he could not support them; OWEN-1813-2,1,46.114

but, while under his care, he did all that any individual, circumstanced
as he was, could do for his fellow creatures.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.115

The error proceeded from the children being sent from the workhouses at
an age much too young for employment.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.116

They ought to have been detained four years longer, and educated;
OWEN-1813-2,1,46.117

and then some of the evils which followed would have been prevented.
OWEN-1813-2,1,46.118

If such be a true picture, not overcharged, of parish apprentices to
our manufacturing system, under the best and most humane regulations, in
what colours must it be exhibited under the worst?  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.119

Mr Dale was advancing in years: OWEN-1813-2,1,46.120

he had no son to succeed him; OWEN-1813-2,1,46.121

and, finding the consequences just described to be the result of all
his strenuous exertions for the improvement and happiness of his fellow
creatures, it is not surprising that he became disposed to retire from
the cares of the establishment.  OWEN-1813-2,1,46.122

He accordingly sold it to some English merchants and manufacturers;
one of <P_1,47> whom, under the circumstances just narrated, undertook
the management of the concern, and fixed his residence in the midst of
the population.  OWEN-1813-2,1,47.123

This individual had been previously in the management of large
establishments, employing a number of workpeople, in the neighbourhood
of Manchester, OWEN-1813-2,1,47.124

and, in every case, by the steady application of certain general
principles, he succeeded in reforming the habits of those under his care,
and who always, among their associates in similar employment, appeared
conspicuous for their good conduct.  OWEN-1813-2,1,47.125

With this previous success in remodelling English character, but ignorant
of the local ideas, manners, and customs, of those now committed to his
management, the stranger commenced his task.  OWEN-1813-2,1,47.126

At that time the lower classes of Scotland, like those of other countries
, had strong prejudices against strangers having any authority over
them , and particularly against the English, few of whom had then
settled in Scotland, and not one in the neighbourhood of the scenes
under description.  OWEN-1813-2,1,47.127

It is also well known that even the Scotch peasantry and working classes
possess the habit of making observations and reasoning thereon with
great acuteness; OWEN-1813-2,1,47.128

and in the present case those employed naturally concluded that the new
purchasers intended merely to make the utmost profit by the establishment
, from the abuses of which many of themselves were then deriving support.
OWEN-1813-2,1,47.129

The persons employed at these works were therefore strongly prejudiced
against the new director of the establishment - prejudiced, because
he was a stranger, and from England - because he succeeded Mr Dale,
under whose proprietorship they acted almost as they liked - because his
religious creed was not theirs - and because they concluded that the works
would be governed by new laws and regulations, calculated to squeeze,
as they often termed it, the greatest sum of gain out of their labour.
OWEN-1813-2,1,47.130

In consequence, from the day he arrived amongst them every means which
ingenuity could devise was set to work to counteract the plan which he
attempted to introduce; OWEN-1813-2,1,47.131

and for two years it was a regular attack and defence of prejudices
and malpractices between the manager and the population of the place,
without the former being able to make much progress, or to convince
the latter of the sincerity of his good intentions for their welfare.
OWEN-1813-2,1,47.132

He, however, did not lose his patience, his temper, or his confidence in
the certain success of the principles on which he founded his conduct.
OWEN-1813-2,1,47.133

These principles ultimately prevailed: OWEN-1813-2,1,47.134

the population could not continue to resist a firm well-directed kindness
, administering justice to all.  OWEN-1813-2,1,47.135

They therefore slowly and cautiously began to give him some portion of
their confidence; OWEN-1813-2,1,47.136

and as this increased, he was enabled more and more to develop his plans
for their amelioration.  OWEN-1813-2,1,47.137

It may with truth be said, that at this period they possessed almost
all the vices and very few of the virtues of a social community.
OWEN-1813-2,1,47.138

Theft and the receipt of stolen goods was their trade, idleness and
drunkenness their habit, falsehood and deception their garb, dissensions ,
civil and religious, their daily practice; OWEN-1813-2,1,47.139

they united only in a zealous systematic opposition to their employers.
OWEN-1813-2,1,47.140

<P_1,48>

Here then was a fair field on which to try the efficacy in
practice of principles supposed capable of altering any characters.
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.142

The manager formed his plans accordingly.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.143

He spent some time in finding out the full extent of the evil against
which he had to contend, and in tracing the true causes which had produced
and were continuing those effects.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.144

He found that all was distrust, disorder, and disunion;
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.145

and he wished to introduce confidence, regularity, and harmony.
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.146

He therefore began to bring forward his various expedients to withdraw
the unfavourable circumstances by which they had hitherto been surrounded,
and to replace them by others calculated to produce a more happy result.
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.147

He soon discovered that theft was extended through almost all the
ramifications of the community, and the receipt of stolen goods through
all the country around.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.148

To remedy this evil, not one legal punishment was inflicted, not one
individual imprisoned, even for an hour; OWEN-1813-2,1,48.149

but checks and other regulations of prevention were introduced;
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.150

a short plain explanation of the immediate benefits they would derive
from a different conduct was inculcated by those instructed for
the purpose, who had the best powers of reasoning among themselves.
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.151

They were at the same time instructed how to direct their industry in
legal and useful occupations, by which, without danger or disgrace, they
could really earn more than they had previously obtained by dishonest
practices.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.152

Thus the difficulty of committing the crime was increased, the detection
afterwards rendered more easy, the habit of honest industry formed,
and the pleasure of good conduct experienced.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.153

Drunkenness was attacked in the same manner; OWEN-1813-2,1,48.154

it was discountenanced on every occasion by those who had charge of any
department: OWEN-1813-2,1,48.155

its destructive and pernicious effects were frequently stated by his
own more prudent comrades, at the proper moment when the individual
was soberly suffering from the effects of his previous excess;
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.156

pot - and public-houses were gradually removed from the immediate vicinity
of their dwellings; OWEN-1813-2,1,48.157

the health and comfort of temperance were made familiar to them;
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.158

by degrees drunkenness disappeared, OWEN-1813-2,1,48.159

and many who were habitual bacchanalians are now conspicuous for
undeviating sobriety.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.160

Falsehood and deception met with a similar fate: OWEN-1813-2,1,48.161

they were held in disgrace; OWEN-1813-2,1,48.162

their practical evils were shortly explained; OWEN-1813-2,1,48.163

and every countenance was given to truth and open conduct.
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.164

The pleasure and substantial advantages derived from the latter soon
overcame the impolicy, error, and consequent misery, which the former
mode of acting had created.  OWEN-1813-2,1,48.165

Dissensions and quarrels were undermined by analagous expedients.
OWEN-1813-2,1,48.166

When they could not be readily adjusted between the parties themselves,
they were stated to the manager; OWEN-1813-2,1,48.167

and as in such cases both disputants were usually more or less in the
wrong, that wrong was in as few words as possible explained, forgiveness
and friendship recommended, and one simple and easily remembered precept
inculcated, as the most valuable rule for their whole conduct, and the
advantages of which they would experience every moment of their lives;
viz. -'That in future they should endeavour to use the same
active <P_1,49> exertions to make each other happy and comfortable, as
they had hitherto done to make each other miserable; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.168

and by carrying this short memorandum in their mind, and applying it
on all occasions, they would soon render that place a paradise, which,
from the most mistaken principle of action, they now made the abode of
misery. 'OWEN-1813-2,1,49.169

The experiment was tried: OWEN-1813-2,1,49.170

the parties enjoyed the gratification of this new mode of conduct;
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.171

references rapidly subsided; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.172

and now serious differences are scarcely known.  OWEN-1813-2,1,49.173

Considerable jealousies also existed on account of one religious sect
possessing a decided preference over the others.  OWEN-1813-2,1,49.174

This was corrected by discontinuing that preference, and by giving a
uniform encouragement to those who conducted themselves well among all the
various religious persuasions; by recommending the same consideration to
be shown to the conscientious opinions of each sect, on the ground that
all must believe the particular doctrines which they had been taught,
and consequently that all were in that respect upon an equal footing, nor
was it possible yet to say which was right or wrong.  OWEN-1813-2,1,49.175

It was likewise inculcated that all should attend to the essence of
religion, and not act as the world was now taught and trained to do; that
is, to overlook the substance and essence of religion, and devote their
talents, time, and money, to that which is far worse than its shadow,
sectarianism; another term for something very injurious to society,
and very absurd, which one or other well-meaning enthusiast has added to
<font> true religion <$$font>, which, without these defects, would soon
form those characters which every wise and good man is anxious to see.
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.176

Such statements and conduct arrested sectarian animosity and ignorant
intolerance; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.177

each retains full liberty of conscience, OWEN-1813-2,1,49.178

and in consequence each partakes of the sincere friendship of many sects
instead of one.  OWEN-1813-2,1,49.179

They act with cordiality together in the same departments and pursuits,
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.180

and associate as though the whole community were not of different
sectarian persuasions; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.181

and not one evil ensues.  OWEN-1813-2,1,49.182

The same principles were applied to correct the irregular intercourse
of the sexes: OWEN-1813-2,1,49.183

such conduct was discountenanced and held in disgrace;
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.184

fines were levied upon both parties for the use of the support fund of
the community.  OWEN-1813-2,1,49.185

<paren> This fund arose from each individual contributing one sixtieth
part of their wages, which, under their management, was applied to
support the sick, and injured by accident, and the aged.  <$$paren>
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.186

But because they had once unfortunately offended against the established
laws and customs of society, they were not forced to become vicious,
abandoned, and miserable; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.187

the door was left open for them to return to the comforts of kind friends
and respected acquaintances; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.188

and, beyond any previous expectation, the evil became greatly diminished.
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.189

The system of receiving apprentices from public charities was abolished
; OWEN-1813-2,1,49.190

permanent settlers with large families were encouraged,
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.191

and comfortable houses were built for their accommodation.
OWEN-1813-2,1,49.192

The practice of employing children in the mills, of six, seven and eight
years <P_1,50> of age, was discontinued, and their parents advised to
allow them to acquire health and education until they were ten years old.
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.193

<paren> It may be remarked, that even this age is too early to keep
them at constant employment in manufactories, from six in the morning
to seven in the evening.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.194

Far better would it be for the children, their parents, and for society ,
that the first should not commence employment until they attain the age
of twelve, when their education might be finished, and their bodies would
be more competent to undergo the fatigue and exertions required of them.
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.195

When parents can be trained to afford this additional time to their
children without inconvenience, they will, of course, adopt the practice
now recommended.  <$$paren> OWEN-1813-2,1,50.196

The children were taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, during five
years, that is, from five to ten, in the village school, without expense
to their parents.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.197

All the modern improvements in education have been adopted,
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.198

or are in process of adoption.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.199

<paren> To avoid the inconveniences which must ever arise from
the introduction of a particular creed into a school, the children
are taught to read in such books as inculcate those precepts of the
Christian religion, which are common to all denominations.  <$$paren>
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.200

They may therefore be taught and $well $trained {TEXT:well-trained}
before they engage in any regular employment.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.201

Another important consideration is, that all their instruction is rendered
a pleasure and delight to them; OWEN-1813-2,1,50.202

they are much more anxious for the hour of school time to arrive than
to end; OWEN-1813-2,1,50.203

they therefore make a rapid progress; OWEN-1813-2,1,50.204

and it may be safely asserted, that if they shall not be trained to form
such characters as may be most desired, the fault will not proceed from
the children; OWEN-1813-2,1,50.205

the cause will be in the want of a true knowledge of human nature in those
who have the management of them and their parents.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.206

During the period that these changes were going forward, attention was
given to the domestic arrangements of the community.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.207

Their houses were rendered more comfortable, OWEN-1813-2,1,50.208

their streets were improved, OWEN-1813-2,1,50.209

the best provisions were purchased, and sold to them at low rates, yet
covering the original expense, and under such regulations as taught them
how to proportion their expenditure to their income.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.210

Fuel and clothes were obtained for them in the same manner;
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.211

and no advantage was attempted to be taken of them, or means used to
deceive them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,50.212

In consequence, their animosity and opposition to the stranger subsided
, OWEN-1813-2,1,50.213

their full confidence was obtained, OWEN-1813-2,1,50.214

and they became satisfied that no evil was intended them;
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.215

they were convinced that a real desire existed to increase their happiness
upon those grounds alone on which it could be permanently increased.
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.216

All difficulties in the way of future improvement vanished.
OWEN-1813-2,1,50.217

They were <P_1,51> taught to be rational, OWEN-1813-2,1,51.218

and they acted rationally.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.219

Thus both parties experienced the incalculable advantages of the system
which had been adopted.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.220

Those employed became industrious, temperate, healthy, faithful to their
employers, and kind to each other; while the proprietors were deriving
services from their attachment, almost without inspection, far beyond
those which could be obtained by any other means than those of mutual
confidence and kindness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.221

Such was the effect of these principles on the adults; on those
whose previous habits had been as ill-formed as habits could be;
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.222

and certainly the application of the principles to practice was made
under the most unfavourable circumstances.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.223

<paren> It may be supposed that this community was separated from other
society; OWEN-1813-2,1,51.224

but the supposition would be erroneous, OWEN-1813-2,1,51.225

for it had daily and hourly communication with a population exceeding
its own number.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.226

The royal borough of Lanark is only one mile distant from the works;
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.227

many individuals came daily from the former to be employed at the latter
; OWEN-1813-2,1,51.228

and a general intercourse is constantly maintained between the old and
new towns.  <$$paren> OWEN-1813-2,1,51.229

I have thus given a detailed account of this experiment, although
a partial application of the principles is of far less importance
than a clear and accurate account of the principles themselves, in
order that they may be so well understood as to be easily rendered
applicable to practice in any community and under any circumstances.
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.230

Without this, particular facts may indeed amuse or astonish,
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.231

but they would not contain that substantial value which the principles
will be found to possess.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.232

But if the relation of the narrative shall forward this object, the
experiment $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fail to prove the certain means of
renovating the moral and religious principles of the world, by showing
whence arise the various opinions, manners, vices, and virtues of mankind,
and how the best or {TEXT:of} the worst of them may, with mathematical
precision, be taught to the rising generation.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.233

Let it not, therefore, be longer said that evil or injurious actions
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be prevented, or that the most rational habits
in the rising generation $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be universally formed.
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.234

In those characters which now exhibit crime, the fault is obviously not
in the individual, OWEN-1813-2,1,51.235

but the defects proceed from the system in which the individual was
trained.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.236

Withdraw those circumstances which tend to create crime in the human
character, and crime will not be created.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.237

Replace them with such as are calculated to form habits of order,
regularity, temperance, industry; and these qualities will be formed.
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.238

Adopt measures of fair equity and justice, and you will readily
acquire the full and complete confidence of the lower orders.
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.239

Proceed systematically on principles of undeviating persevering kindness ,
yet retaining and using, with the least possible severity, the means of
restraining crime from immediately injuring society; and by degrees even
the crimes now existing in the adults will also gradually disappear ;
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.240

for the $worst-formed {TEXT:worst_formed} disposition, short of incurable
insanity, will not long resist a firm, determined, well-directed,
persevering kindness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,51.241

Such a proceeding, whenever practised, will be found the most powerful and
effective corrector of crime, and of all injurious and improper habits.
OWEN-1813-2,1,51.242

<P_1,52>

The experiment narrated shows that this is not hypothesis and theory.
OWEN-1813-2,1,52.244

The principles may be with confidence stated to be universal, and
applicable to all times, persons, and circumstances.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.245

And the most obvious application of them would be to adopt rational means
to remove the temptation to commit crimes, and increase the difficulties
of committing them; while, at the same time, a proper direction should
be given to the active powers of the individual; and a due share provided
of uninjurious amusements and recreation.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.246

Care must also be taken to remove the causes of jealousy, dissensions,
and irritation; to introduce sentiments calculated to create union and
confidence among all the members of the community; OWEN-1813-2,1,52.247

and the whole should be directed by a persevering kindness, sufficiently
evident to prove that a sincere desire exists to increase, and not to
diminish, happiness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.248

These principles, applied to the community at New Lanark, at first
under many of the most discouraging circumstances, but persevered in for
sixteen years, effected a complete change in the general character of
the village, containing upwards of 2,000 inhabitants, and into which,
also, there was a constant influx of newcomers.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.249

But as the promulgation of new miracles is not for present times, it is
not pretended that under such circumstances one and all are become wise
and good; or, that they are free from error.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.250

But it may be truly stated, that they now constitute a very improved
society; that their worst habits are gone, and that their minor ones
will soon disappear under a continuance of the application of the same
principles; that during the period mentioned, scarcely a legal punishment
has been inflicted, or an application been made for parish funds by any
individual among them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.251

Drunkenness is not seen in their streets; OWEN-1813-2,1,52.252

and the children are taught and trained in the institution for forming
their character without any punishment.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.253

The community exhibits the general appearance of industry, temperance,
comfort, health, and happiness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.254

These are and ever will be the sure and certain effects of the adoption
of the principles explained; OWEN-1813-2,1,52.255

and these principles, applied with judgement, will effectually reform
the most vicious community existing, and train the younger part of it
to any character which may be desired; and that, too, much more easily
on an extended than on a limited scale.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.256

To apply these principles, however, successfully to practice, both a
comprehensive and a minute view must be taken of the existing state of
the society on which they are intended to operate.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.257

The causes of the most prevalent evils must be accurately traced,
OWEN-1813-2,1,52.258

and those means which appear the most easy and simple should be
immediately applied to remove them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,52.259

In this progress the smallest alteration, adequate to produce any good
effect, should be made at one time; OWEN-1813-2,1,52.260

indeed, if possible, the change should be so gradual as to be almost
imperceptible, yet always making a permanent advance <P_1,53> in the
desired improvements.  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.261

By this procedure the most rapid practical progress will be obtained,
because the inclination to resistance will be removed, and time will
be given for reason to weaken the force of long-established injurious
prejudices.  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.262

The removal of the first evil will prepare the way for the removal of
the second; OWEN-1813-2,1,53.263

and this facility will increase, not in an arithmetical, but in a
geometrical proportion; until the directors of the system will themselves
be gratified beyond expression with the beneficial magnitude of their
own proceedings.  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.264

Nor while these principles shall be acted upon can there be any
retrogression in this good work; OWEN-1813-2,1,53.265

for the permanence of the amelioration will be equal to its extent.
OWEN-1813-2,1,53.266

What then remains to prevent such a system from being immediately adopted
into national practice?  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.267

Nothing, surely, but a general destitution of the knowledge of the
practice.  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.268

For with the certain means of preventing crimes, can it be supposed that
British legislators, as soon as these means shall be made evident, will
longer withhold them from their fellow subjects?  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.269

No: I am persuaded that neither prince, ministers, parliament, nor any
party in church or state, will avow inclination to act on principles of
such flagrant injustice.  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.270

Have they not on many occasions evinced a sincere and ardent desire to
ameliorate the condition of the subjects of the empire, when practicable
means of amelioration were explained to them, which could be adopted
without risking the safety of the state?  OWEN-1813-2,1,53.271

For some time to come there can be but one practicable, and therefore one
rational reform, which without danger can be attempted in these realms;
a reform in which all men and all parties may join - that is, a reform
in the training and in the management of the poor, the ignorant, the
untaught and untrained, or ill-taught and ill-trained, among the whole
mass of British population; OWEN-1813-2,1,53.272

and a plain, simple, practicable plan which would not contain the <P_1,54>
least danger to any individual, or to any part of society, may be devised
for that purpose.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.273

That plan is a national, well-digested, unexclusive system for the
formation of character and general amelioration of the lower orders.
OWEN-1813-2,1,54.274

On the experience of a life devoted to the subject, I hesitate not to say,
that the members of any community may by degrees be trained to live <font>
without idleness, without poverty, without crime, and without punishment
<$$font>; OWEN-1813-2,1,54.275

for each of these is the effect of error in the various systems prevalent
throughout the world.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.276

<font> They are all necessary consequences of ignorance.  <$$font>
OWEN-1813-2,1,54.277

Train any population rationally, and they will be rational.
OWEN-1813-2,1,54.278

Furnish honest and useful employments to those so trained, and
such employments they will greatly prefer to dishonest or injurious
occupations.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.279

It is beyond all calculation the interest of every government to provide
that training and that employment; OWEN-1813-2,1,54.280

and to provide both is easily practicable.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.281

The first, as before stated, is to be obtained by a national system for
the formation of character; the second, by governments preparing a reserve
of employment for the surplus working classes, when the general demand
for labour throughout the country is not equal to the full occupation of
the whole: that employment to be on useful national objects from which
the public may derive advantage equal to the expense which those works
may require.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.282

The national plan for the formation of character should <font> include
<$$font> all the modern improvements of education, without regard to
the system of any one individual; OWEN-1813-2,1,54.283

and should not <font> exclude <$$font> the child of any one subject in
the empire.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.284

Anything short of this would be an act of intolerance and injustice to
the excluded, and of injury to society, so glaring and manifest, that
I shall be deceived in the character of my countrymen if any of those
who have influence in church and state should now be found willing to
attempt it.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.285

Is it not indeed strikingly evident even to common observers, that any
further effort to enforce religious exclusion would involve the certain
and speedy destruction of the present church establishment, and would
even endanger our civil institutions.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.286

It may be said, however, that ministers and parliament have many other
important subjects under discussion.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.287

This is evidently true; OWEN-1813-2,1,54.288

but will they not have high national concerns always to engage their
attention?  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.289

And can any question be brought forward of deeper interest to the
community than that which affects the formation of character and the
well-being of every individual within the empire?  A question, too, which,
when understood, will be found to offer the means of amelioration to the
revenues of these kingdoms, far beyond any practical plan now likely to
be devised.  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.290

Yet, important as are considerations of revenue, they must appear
secondary when put in competition with the lives, liberty, and comfort
of our fellow subjects, which are now hourly sacrificed for want of
an <font> effective legislative measure to prevent crime.  <$$font>
OWEN-1813-2,1,54.291

And is an act of such vital importance to the well-being of all to be
longer delayed?  OWEN-1813-2,1,54.292

<font> Shall yet another year pass in which crime shall be forced on
the infant, who in ten, twenty, <$$font> <P_1,55> or thirty years hence
shall suffer death for being taught that crime?  OWEN-1813-2,1,55.293

Surely it is impossible.  OWEN-1813-2,1,55.294

Should it be so delayed, <font> the individuals of the present parliament,
the legislators of this day, <$$font> ought in strict and impartial
justice to be amenable to the laws for not adopting the means in
their power to prevent the crime; rather than the poor, untrained,
and unprotected culprit, whose previous years, if he had language to
describe them, would exhibit a life of unceasing wretchedness, arising
<font> solely <$$font> from the errors of society.  OWEN-1813-2,1,55.295

Much might be added on these momentous subjects, even to make them
evident to the capacities of children: OWEN-1813-2,1,55.296

but for obvious reasons the outlines are merely sketched;
OWEN-1813-2,1,55.297

and it is hoped these outlines will be sufficient to induce the
well-disposed of all parties cordially to unite in this vital measure
for the preservation of everything dear to society.  OWEN-1813-2,1,55.298

In the next Essay an account will be given of the plans which are in
progress at New Lanark for the further comfort and improvement of its
inhabitants; and a general <font> practical <$$font> system be described ,
by which the same advantages may be gradually introduced among the poor
and working classes throughout the United Kingdom.  OWEN-1813-2,1,55.299

<P_1,56>

Third Essay OWEN-1813-2,1,56.301

<font> The Principles of the Former Essays applied to a Particular
Situation <$$font> OWEN-1813-2,1,56.302

Truth must ultimately prevail over error OWEN-1813-2,1,56.303

<$$heading>

At the conclusion of the Second Essay, a promise was made that an account
should be given of the plans which were in progress at New Lanark for the
further improvement of its inhabitants; and that a practical system should
be sketched, by which equal advantages might be generally introduced
among the poor and working classes throughout the United Kingdom.
OWEN-1813-2,1,56.305

This account became necessary, in order to exhibit even a limited view
of the principles on which the plans of the author are founded, and to
recommend them generally to practice.  OWEN-1813-2,1,56.306

That which has been hitherto done for the community at New Lanark, as
described in the Second Essay, has chiefly consisted in <font> withdrawing
some of those circumstances which tended to generate, continue, or
increase early bad habits; that is to say, undoing that which society
had from ignorance permitted to be done.  <$$font> OWEN-1813-2,1,56.307

To effect this, however, was a far more difficult task than to train up
a child from infancy in the way he should go; OWEN-1813-2,1,56.308

for that is the most easy process for the formation of character;
while to unlearn and to change long acquired habits is a proceeding
directly opposed to the most tenacious feelings of human nature.
OWEN-1813-2,1,56.309

Nevertheless, the proper application steadily pursued did effect
beneficial changes on these old habits, even beyond the most
sanguine expectations of the party by whom the task was undertaken.
OWEN-1813-2,1,56.310

The principles were driven from the study of human nature itself
OWEN-1813-2,1,56.311

and they could not fail of success.  OWEN-1813-2,1,56.312

Still, however, very little, comparatively speaking, had been done
for them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,56.313

They had not been taught the most valuable domestic and social habits:
such as the most economical method of preparing food; how to arrange
their dwellings with neatness, and to keep them always clean and in
order; OWEN-1813-2,1,56.314

but, what was of infinitely more importance, they had not been instructed
how to train their children to form them into valuable members of the
community, or to know that principles existed, which, when properly
applied to practice from infancy, would ensure from man to man , without
chance of failure, a just, open, sincere, and benevolent conduct.
OWEN-1813-2,1,56.315

It was in this stage of the progress of improvement, that it became
necessary to form arrangements for surrounding them with circumstances
which should gradually prepare the individuals to receive and firmly
retain those domestic <P_1,57> and social acquirements and habits.
OWEN-1813-2,1,57.316

For this purpose a building, which may be termed the'new institution ',
was erected in the centre of the establishment, with an enclosed area
before it.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.317

The area is intended for a playground for the children of the villagers
, from the time they can walk alone until they enter the school.
OWEN-1813-2,1,57.318

It must be evident to those who have been in the practice of observing
children with attention, that much of good or evil is taught to or
acquired by a child at a very early period of its life; that much of
temper or disposition is correctly or incorrectly formed before he
attains his second year; and that many durable impressions are made at
the termination of the first twelve or even six months of his existence.
OWEN-1813-2,1,57.319

The children, therefore, of the uninstructed and ill-instructed, suffer
material injury in the formation of their characters during these and
the subsequent years of childhood and of youth.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.320

It was to prevent, or as much as possible to counteract, these primary
evils, to which the poor and working classes are exposed when infants,
that the area became part of the New Institution.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.321

Into this playground the children are to be received as soon as they
can freely walk alone; to be superintended by persons instructed to take
charge of them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.322

As the happiness of man chiefly, if not altogether, depends on his own
sentiments and habits, as well as those of the individuals around him;
and as any sentiments and habits may be given to all infants, it becomes
of primary importance that those alone should be given to them which
can contribute to their happiness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.323

Each child, therefore, on his entrance into the playground, is to be
told in language which he can understand, that'he is never to injure
his playfellows; but that, on the contrary, he is to contribute all in
his power to make them happy. 'OWEN-1813-2,1,57.324

This simple precept, when comprehended in all its bearings, and the
habits which will arise from its early adoption into practice, <font>
if no counteracting principle be forced upon the young mind <$$font>,
will effectually supersede all the errors which have hitherto kept the
world in ignorance and misery.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.325

So simple a precept, too, will be easily taught, and as easily acquired
; OWEN-1813-2,1,57.326

for the chief employment of the superintendents will be to prevent any
deviation from it in practice.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.327

The older children, when they shall have experienced the endless
advantages from acting on this principle, will, by their example, soon
enforce the practice of it on the young strangers: OWEN-1813-2,1,57.328

and the happiness, which the little groups will enjoy from this rational
conduct, will ensure its speedy and general and willing adoption.
OWEN-1813-2,1,57.329

The habit also which they will acquire at this early period of
life by continually acting on the principle, will fix it firmly;
OWEN-1813-2,1,57.330

it will become easy and familiar to them, or, as it is often termed,
natural.  OWEN-1813-2,1,57.331

Thus, by merely attending to the evidence of our senses respecting human
nature, and disregarding the wild, inconsistent, and absurd theories
in which man has been hitherto trained in all parts of the earth,
we shall accomplish with ease and certainty the supposed Herculean
labour of forming a rational <P_1,58> character in man, and that, too,
chiefly before the child commences the ordinary course of education.
OWEN-1813-2,1,58.332

The character thus early formed will be as durable as it will be
advantageous to the individual and to the community; OWEN-1813-2,1,58.333

for by the constitution of our nature, when once the mind fully
understands that which is true, the impression of that truth $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be erased except by mental disease or death; while error
must be relinquished at every period of life, whenever it can be made
manifest to the mind in which it has been received.  OWEN-1813-2,1,58.334

This part of the arrangement, therefore, will effect the following
purposes: OWEN-1813-2,1,58.335

The child will be removed, so far as *T-1* is at present practicable,
from the erroneous treatment of the yet untrained and untaught parents.
OWEN-1813-2,1,58.336

The parents will be relieved from the loss of time and from the care and
anxiety which are now occasioned by attendance on their children from
the period when they can go alone to that at which they enter the school.
OWEN-1813-2,1,58.337

The child will be placed in a situation of safety, where, with its
future schoolfellows and companions, it will acquire the best habits
and principles, while at mealtimes and at night it will return to the
caresses of its parents; OWEN-1813-2,1,58.338

and the affections of each are likely to be increased by the separation.
OWEN-1813-2,1,58.339

The area is also to be a place of meeting for the children from five
to ten years of age, previous to and after school-hours, and to serve
for a drill-ground, the object of which will be hereafter explained;
OWEN-1813-2,1,58.340

and a shade will be formed, under which in stormy weather the children
may retire for shelter.  OWEN-1813-2,1,58.341

These are the important purposes to which a playground attached to a
school may be applied.  OWEN-1813-2,1,58.342

<P_1,59>

Those who have derived a knowledge of human nature from observation
know that man in every situation requires relaxation from his constant
and regular occupations, whatever they be: and that if he shall not be
provided with or permitted to enjoy innocent and uninjurious amusements
, he must and will partake of those which he can obtain, to give him
temporary relief from his exertions, although the means of gaining that
relief should be most pernicious.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.344

For man, irrationally instructed, is ever influenced far more by immediate
feelings than by remote considerations.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.345

Those, then, who desire to give mankind the character which it
would be for the happiness of all that they should possess, will not
fail to make careful provision for their amusement and recreation.
OWEN-1813-2,1,59.346

The Sabbath was originally so intended.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.347

It was instituted to be a day of universal enjoyment and happiness to
the human race.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.348

It is frequently made, however, from the opposite extremes of error,
either a day of superstitious gloom and tyranny over the mind, or of the
most destructive intemperance and licentiousness.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.349

The one of these has been the cause of the other; the latter the certain
and natural consequence of the former.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.350

Relieve the human mind from useless and superstitious restraints; train
it on those principles which facts, ascertained from the first knowledge
of time to this day, demonstrate to be the only principles which are true;
and intemperance and licentiousness will not exist; OWEN-1813-2,1,59.351

for such conduct in itself is neither the immediate nor the future
interest of man; OWEN-1813-2,1,59.352

and he is ever governed by one or other of these considerations,
according to the habits which have been given to him from infancy.
OWEN-1813-2,1,59.353

The Sabbath, in many parts of Scotland, is not a day of innocent and
cheerful recreation to the labouring man; OWEN-1813-2,1,59.354

nor can those who are confined all the week to sedentary occupations,
freely partake, without censure, of the air and exercise to which nature
invites them, and which their health demands.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.355

The errors of the times of superstition and bigotry still hold some sway
, OWEN-1813-2,1,59.356

and compel those who wish to preserve a regard to their respectability
in society, to an overstrained demeanour; OWEN-1813-2,1,59.357

and this demeanour sometimes degenerates into hypocrisy,
OWEN-1813-2,1,59.358

and is often the cause of great inconsistency.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.359

It is destructive of every open, honest, generous, and manly feeling.
OWEN-1813-2,1,59.360

It disgusts many, OWEN-1813-2,1,59.361

and drives them to the opposite extreme.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.362

It is sometimes the cause of insanity.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.363

It is founded on ignorance, OWEN-1813-2,1,59.364

and defeats its own object.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.365

While erroneous customs prevail in any country, it would evince an
ignorance of human nature in any individual to offend against them,
until he has convinced the community of their error.  OWEN-1813-2,1,59.366

<P_1,60>

To counteract, in some degree, the inconvenience which arose from
the misapplication of the Sabbath, it became necessary to introduce
on the other days of the week some innocent amusement and recreation
for those whose labours were unceasing, and in winter almost uniform.
OWEN-1813-2,1,60.368

In summer, the inhabitants of the village of New Lanark have their
gardens and potato grounds to cultivate; OWEN-1813-2,1,60.369

they have walks laid out to give them health and the habit of being
gratified with the ever-changing scenes of nature - OWEN-1813-2,1,60.370

for those scenes afford not only the most economical, but also the most
innocent pleasures which man can enjoy; OWEN-1813-2,1,60.371

and all men may be easily trained to enjoy them.  OWEN-1813-2,1,60.372

In winter the community are deprived of these healthy occupations and
amusements; OWEN-1813-2,1,60.373

they are employed ten hours and three-quarters every day in the week,
except Sunday, OWEN-1813-2,1,60.374

and generally every individual continues during that time at the same
work: OWEN-1813-2,1,60.375

and experience has shown that the average health and spirits of
the community are several degrees lower in winter than in summer;
OWEN-1813-2,1,60.376

and this in part may be fairly attributed to that cause.
OWEN-1813-2,1,60.377

These considerations suggested the necessity of rooms for innocent
amusements and rational recreation.  OWEN-1813-2,1,60.378

Many well-intentioned individuals, unaccustomed to witness the conduct
of those among the lower orders who have been rationally treated and
trained, may fancy such an assemblage will necessarily become a scene
of confusion and disorder; instead of which, however, it proceeds with
uniform propriety; it is highly favourable to the health, spirits,
and dispositions of the individuals so engaged; and if any irregularity
should arise, the cause will be solely owing to the parties who attempt
to direct the proceedings being deficient in a practical knowledge of
human nature.  OWEN-1813-2,1,60.379

It has been and ever will be found far more easy to lead mankind to
virtue, or to rational conduct, by providing them with well-regulated
innocent amusements and recreations, than by forcing them to submit
to useless restraints, which tend only to create disgust, and often
to connect such feelings even with that which is excellent in itself,
merely because it has been judiciously associated.  OWEN-1813-2,1,60.380

Hitherto, indeed, in all ages and in all countries, man seems to have
blindly <P_1,61> conspired against the happiness of man, and to have
remained as ignorant of himself as he was of the solar system prior to
the days of Copernicus and Galileo.  OWEN-1813-2,1,61.381

Many of the learned and wise among our ancestors were conscious of this
ignorance, OWEN-1813-2,1,61.382

and deeply lamented its effects; OWEN-1813-2,1,61.383

and some of them recommended the partial adoption of those principles
which can alone relieve the world from the miserable effects of ignorance.
OWEN-1813-2,1,61.384

The time, however, for the emancipation of the human mind had not then
arrived: OWEN-1813-2,1,61.385

the world was not prepared to receive it.  OWEN-1813-2,1,61.386

The history of humanity shows it to be an undeviating law of nature,
that man shall not prematurely break the shell of ignorance; that he
must patiently wait until the principle of knowledge has pervaded the
whole mass of the interior, to give it life and strength sufficient to
bear the light of day.  OWEN-1813-2,1,61.387

Those who have duly reflected on the nature and extent of the mental
movements of the world for the last half-century, must be conscious that
great changes are in progress; that man is about to advance another
important step towards that degree of intelligence which his natural
powers seem capable of attaining.  OWEN-1813-2,1,61.388

Observe the transactions of the passing hours; OWEN-1813-2,1,61.389

see the whole mass of mind in full motion; OWEN-1813-2,1,61.390

behold it momentarily increasing in vigour, and preparing ere long to
burst its confinement.  OWEN-1813-2,1,61.391

But what is to be the nature of this change?  OWEN-1813-2,1,61.392

A due attention to the facts around us, and to those transmitted by the
invention of printing from former ages, will afford a satisfactory reply.
OWEN-1813-2,1,61.393
