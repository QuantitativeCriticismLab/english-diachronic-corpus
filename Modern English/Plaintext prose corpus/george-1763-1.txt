Thinking it very probable that Ld Hardwicke will come here with his

opinion whether I ought or ought not to speak to him; GEORGE-1763-1,180.4

Nothing can be more proper than my D. Friend's observations on
the paper drawn up by Ld Egremont; GEORGE-1763-1,180.9

and it has already had its effect the D de Nivernois having yielded every
point except the one of the Mississipy, and on that consented that two
or three expedients shall be sent to France and one of them accepted;
GEORGE-1763-1,180.10

both just and wise.  GEORGE-1763-1,180.11

I have carefully examined the list of those that have regiments
GEORGE-1763-1,181.20

and see it the interest of no old {COM:sic}, unless out of some particular
private reason unknown, to change for one of the regiments in Ireland
GEORGE-1763-1,181.21

my scheme is therefore the giving the 10th Regiment of Foot to Major
Genl. Sandford that the 26th Regt. of Foot vulgarly called
the Calledonians {COM:sic} may have again a Scotch Commander, and that
Col: Scott; GEORGE-1763-1,181.22

Lord Albemarle has pushed much for an old regiment for his brother;
GEORGE-1763-1,181.23

if he got the 16th of Foot, that would be a feather for his commanding
the assault at the Moro Castle, which was the true cause of taking the
Havannah GEORGE-1763-1,181.24

and Brudenell would according to Lord Ligonier take that regiment as it
is very high among those that remain at the Peace.  GEORGE-1763-1,181.25

If this is agreeable to my D. Friend I will order it $today
{TEXT:to_day} and Ld. Pultny and Ligonier as Aid de Camps;
GEORGE-1763-1,181.26

I shall not fail to observe to <P_183> Lord Halifax that Lord Egremont

Lord Egremont open'd to me on Saturday <paren> when he asked leave to
go for a few days into Sussex <$$paren> my D. Friend's idea of
comprehending Hanover in the Neutrality, which he had named to Nivernois ,

do it with pleasure, GEORGE-1763-1,183.48

be no jealousy in that quarter of things being said to Nivernois that
he is not entrusted with; GEORGE-1763-1,183.49

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} conceive from whence it comes that Prince

this shall be again order'd; GEORGE-1763-1,183.51

though as he was to leave the army on Christmas Eve I should imagine
Granby the proper person now to give the passport; GEORGE-1763-1,183.52

what the French mean by saying none of the troops have yet left the
Combined Army; GEORGE-1763-1,183.53

the Hanoverians were in their own territories on the 6th and 7th of this

Lord Mansfield's indecent language is not anything surprizing to me,

his disinclination to Government, and his own opinion of his superiority
of abilitys over the rest of the world, are reasons enough without
searching farther for causes that have made him so highly improper on
this occasion.  GEORGE-1763-1,184.59

Fox told Lord Halifax that were there no difference of opinions on this
occasion he thought it would be look'd on as very improper by most people
that a Council should be summon'd for the Preliminary Articles and no
one for the Definitive Treaty GEORGE-1763-1,184.60

as this was the case I thought it was not worth while to make many
complaints on this occasion GEORGE-1763-1,184.61

and therefore wish to know when my D. Friend would have the

Lord Egremont will come back on Sunday; GEORGE-1763-1,184.63

I have already heard of Lord Albemarle's wish of rank to Lt. Col:

presented me on Friday through Lord Ligonier a memorial stating Lord
Albemarle's having declar'd Grant a Colonel by Brevet; which oblig'd
the other brave man to come home rather than serve under his junior:
GEORGE-1763-1,185.81

Grant is undoubtedly a gallant officer; GEORGE-1763-1,185.82

GEORGE-1763-1,194.201

he express'd some concern at his losing his Aid de Camp's which I said
had been done by way of oeconomy, GEORGE-1763-1,194.202

he ask'd whether I had order'd his patent to be recalled which I told
him I had not; GEORGE-1763-1,194.203

after that he said he fear'd the army would be on the same footing
as in Sir Robt. Walpole's time, which made it very bad at the
beginning of the last war; to which I told him I should now think of
the best method for preventing that; GEORGE-1763-1,194.204

now I can any day my D. Friend pleases tell him he is to do
nothing; GEORGE-1763-1,194.205

he offer'd <P_195> to review the regiments for nothing to which I said
that did not come as yet to be thought of GEORGE-1763-1,195.206

but the manner of reviewing the regiments would be among other
arrangements soon to be consider'd.  GEORGE-1763-1,195.207

Mr. Ch. Townshend's conduct is what I should not
have thought any other man capable of, but himself very much so,
GEORGE-1763-1,195.208

for I look on him as the worst man that lives, GEORGE-1763-1,195.209

it was that made me tell my D. Friend the other day I could
never bear the thoughts {COM:sic} of seeing him hold the seals
GEORGE-1763-1,195.210

this confirms me in it, GEORGE-1763-1,195.211

I would as soon employ a common thief as him.  GEORGE-1763-1,195.212

Has my D. Friend considered Behr's paper.  GEORGE-1763-1,195.213

{ED:275_Thursday_3_March_1763}

Ld. Egremont has been here, GEORGE-1763-1,195.215

he has seen Ld. Mansfield, Ld. Egmont, Mr. Greenville
and Ld. Halifax who are all of opinion that unless Mr. de
Mello agrees to the exchanging ratifications without Portugal, that it
will be contrary to other treaties to do it, and in some degree a breach
of faith to our only ally; GEORGE-1763-1,195.216

I wish my D Friend would see Egremont who was in South Audley Street
this morning.  GEORGE-1763-1,195.217

I enclose another paper from Baron Behr.  GEORGE-1763-1,195.218

ten {COM:lowercase} o'clock GEORGE-1763-1,196.222

Tho unable to find expressions strong enough to paint to my D.
Friend what I feel at the very generous and unparallel'd part he has
acted this day, I should think myself very insensible did I not once
more $tonight {TEXT:to_night} acquaint him how much I am oblig'd to him
for his conduct: GEORGE-1763-1,196.223

I hope that same Providence that has ever directed my steps, and has
employ'd my D. Friend to guide me through perilous and dangerous
situations to the haven of honour and integrity, will now at this
critical minute point out some arrangement more perfect than the one
propos'd this day; GEORGE-1763-1,196.224

my D. Friend must not be surprised that the seeing him resolved
to quit the scene of business is the most {TEXT:is_the_most_is_the_most}
cruel blow that could have happen'd to me.  GEORGE-1763-1,196.225

{ED:277_early_March_1763}

35 m. pt. 7.  GEORGE-1763-1,196.227

My D. Friend's nobleness of nature $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be more enrag'd at the overbearing letter he has received than I am;
GEORGE-1763-1,196.228

but I fear all these warm heads will act as this ungrateful man does,
GEORGE-1763-1,196.229

but why shall I fix it on them only when I daily see men of a more
phlegmatic disposition act in the same manner; GEORGE-1763-1,196.230

that my D. Friend is heartily sick of his situation I can easily
credit; GEORGE-1763-1,196.231

and I scarcely should think it right as $a friend to press him to
continue if I did not feel a stronger tye, my affection to my country;
GEORGE-1763-1,196.232

but when I consider that the man <P_197> he would on such an occasion
recommend as his successor is of all men the one I should be most
griev'd at seeing in his place, I must beg him to continue till summer
or instantly look out for some other man than Mr. Fox for that
mighty office; GEORGE-1763-1,197.233

why $can $not {TEXT:cannot} Mr. Greenville be made a peer and have
either Oswald, or Elliott or even Lord Barrington for his Chancellor of
the Exchequer, GEORGE-1763-1,197.234

what right has Mr. Fox to complain, GEORGE-1763-1,197.235

did he not himself tell me that any office of business is improper for
the Minister of the House of Commons; GEORGE-1763-1,197.236

I name this expedient to show that if my D. Friend $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} persuade himself to continue <paren> which I confess
will grieve me most excessively <$$paren> that I must expect to see him
have an honest man as his successor in a board where that is the most
necessary of all qualifications; GEORGE-1763-1,197.237

if he should absolutely resolve to quit I hope he will accept
the Chamberlain's Staff and become once again a Court officer;
GEORGE-1763-1,197.238

for I can never agree to his being without office.  GEORGE-1763-1,197.239

{ED:278_circa_Saturday,_5_March_1763}

10 m. pt. 2.  GEORGE-1763-1,197.241

I quite agree with my Dear Friend that it would be highly improper if
these gentlemen in office who have differ'd with the present Minister
in the House of Commons so openly were not to feel some resentment.
GEORGE-1763-1,197.242

I am ever hurt when my D. Friend and myself are in the least of
different opinions GEORGE-1763-1,197.243

$'t $is {TEXT:tis} what I ever strive to prevent; GEORGE-1763-1,197.244

but in the case of Mr. Fox I fear we shall never think alike,
GEORGE-1763-1,197.245

I have one principle firmly rooted in my mind from the many <P_198>
seasonable letters I have receiv'd from my D. Friend never to
trust a man void of principles, GEORGE-1763-1,198.246

if any man ever deserved that character $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} Mr.
Fox; GEORGE-1763-1,198.247

the seeing him at the head of the House of Commons was very unpleasant
to me: GEORGE-1763-1,198.248

but I consented to it, as that was the only means of getting my D.
Friend to proceed this winter in the Treasury; GEORGE-1763-1,198.249

if he resolves to quit that situation the only consideration that could
make me bear Mr. Fox is vanish'd; GEORGE-1763-1,198.250

and then his own bad character comes strongly into my thoughts when I
hear him nam'd; GEORGE-1763-1,198.251

$'t $is {TEXT:tis} not prejudice but aversion to his whole mode of
government that causes my writing so openly my thoughts to my only friend
; GEORGE-1763-1,198.252

has this whole winter been any thing else but a scene of corruption
GEORGE-1763-1,198.253

and I am persuaded were he the acting Minister this would appear in more
ways, than he is now able to accomplish; GEORGE-1763-1,198.254

for my D. Friend's heart is too upright and his principles too
well grounded to approve of this; GEORGE-1763-1,198.255

they are the true sources of his dislike to his present employment,
which has given him too many proofs of the baseness of the present age.
GEORGE-1763-1,198.256

{ED:279_?_Monday,_7_March_1763}

My D. Friend chusing to be silent on Ld Talbots speech, except
his high flown compliments on the D of Newcastle, is a clear proof to me
how extremely improper his language must have been; GEORGE-1763-1,198.258

his conduct the whole winter has been unaccountable, either silent in
the house or attacking friends and commending foes; GEORGE-1763-1,198.259

this is not to be $borne {TEXT:boren}, GEORGE-1763-1,198.260

the unhappy system that has been follow'd but too often since I have
mounted the throne of preferring men who have opinions of their own,
has aided to weaken Government, GEORGE-1763-1,198.261

I have long heard my D Friend wish it had been otherwise:
GEORGE-1763-1,198.262

a Talbot, a Dashwood, a Strange, are forever running counter;
GEORGE-1763-1,198.263

thus honest men are seldom to be kept right GEORGE-1763-1,198.264

and others for want of honesty are ever underhand wishing to do mischief.
GEORGE-1763-1,198.265

10 o'clk. <P_199> {ED:280_Friday,_11_March_1763}
GEORGE-1763-1,199.266

40 m. pt. 5.  GEORGE-1763-1,199.267

When I write to my D. Friend I chuse to lay my thoughts naked
before him, and leave nothing behind the curtain; GEORGE-1763-1,199.268

he knows my personal dislike to Mr. Fox as a man
GEORGE-1763-1,199.269

therefore if I say anything that is favourable to the plan I heartily
wish could be done without, it is from conviction not predilection.
GEORGE-1763-1,199.270

I never saw anything less calculated to cement, and make a firm
administration $than {TEXT:that} the scheme form'd by Mr. Fox;
GEORGE-1763-1,199.271

the making Ld. Gower and Ld. Shelburne Secretaries of
State would in my opinion be taking two men little fitter than Denbigh
Ravensworth and Pomfret or Ld. Talbot: GEORGE-1763-1,199.272

as to Ld. Waldegrave I think him in some things better than the
two others, GEORGE-1763-1,199.273

but he would fairly be but a chip in the porrige {COM:sic}.
GEORGE-1763-1,199.274

I fear predilection for the three he recommends has guided his judgment
as far from the truth as his aversion to Mr. Greenville does
when he calls him $ill-natur'd {TEXT:ill_natur'd}, weak, and dishonest,
GEORGE-1763-1,199.275

as to his pointing out Oswald for Chanc. of the Exchr. I
believe he is not wrong as to his abilitys GEORGE-1763-1,199.276

but I must confess that I agree with my D. Friend that perhaps
his being born on the other side of the Tweed might cause some more
abuse GEORGE-1763-1,199.277

but I would willingly go through fifty times as much if I could
persuade my D. Friend to remain at the head of the Treasury;
GEORGE-1763-1,199.278

for I am still more uneasy after seeing Fox's paper; GEORGE-1763-1,199.279

his whole attack on the Chancellor and Greenville is $their {TEXT:there}
not using their department for H. of Commons jobbs {COM:sic}
; GEORGE-1763-1,199.280

if Mr. Fox is Minister I plainly see the very Judges must be
fill'd by wretches that are unfit to decide the properties of freemen,
because they can be the means of acquiring a vote in Parliament; the
sea and land service to be filled by <P_200> improper persons for the
same purpose instead of the men who have by their conduct done honour
to their Country, GEORGE-1763-1,200.281

by this means both the military branches will be on the same low footing
as when Sir Robt. Walpole quitted Government GEORGE-1763-1,200.282

and believe me my D. Friend when once things are got into the state
I fear they will, nothing can save the country; GEORGE-1763-1,200.283

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} think that I am merely saying to show my aversion
to Mr. Fox GEORGE-1763-1,200.284

but $'t $is {TEXT:tis} to express the anguish of mind I am in at thinking
that perhaps necessity may force me to accept of the man I would rather
see perish than at the head of Ministry; GEORGE-1763-1,200.285

once more I beg my D. Friend to consider if no method
can be hit upon to prevent what my mind so much revolts against,
GEORGE-1763-1,200.286

if none can, I agree to the trying Fox, GEORGE-1763-1,200.287

but I owne {COM:sic} from the moment he comes in I shall not feel myself
interested in the public affairs and shall feel rejoic'd whenever I can
see a glimmering hope of getting quit of him.  GEORGE-1763-1,200.288
