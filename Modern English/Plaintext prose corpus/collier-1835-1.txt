Scene I.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.5

- <font> A handsome Apartment in Lady Caroline Butler's Mansion, opening
on to a spacious Lawn.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.6

The Room hung round with Sporting Pictures, Guns, Whips, Pistols, Bows
and Arrows, &c. COLLIER-1835-1,5.7

Elegant Furniture.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.8

Looking Glass, Sofa, Chairs and Table, and an Easel.  <$$font>
COLLIER-1835-1,5.9

Captain Cleveland, <font> discovered, reclining on the Sofa, perusing
the Newspaper.  <$$font> COLLIER-1835-1,5.10

<font> Cha. <$$font> This is what I call giving an old
friend a hearty welcome with a vengeance after a five years'absence
COLLIER-1835-1,5.11

<bracket> <font> Looks at his Watch.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
COLLIER-1835-1,5.12

As I live, it is past four o'clock: COLLIER-1835-1,5.13

and here have I been for the last seven hours, without seeing
one of the precious inmates of this mansion, except the servants.
COLLIER-1835-1,5.14

Lady Caroline, I am certain, must have received my uncle's letter,
informing her that we should be here to breakfast.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.15

I shall, I fear, have too much reason to believe all the reports I
have heard concerning her ladyships {COM:sic} strange mode of living.
COLLIER-1835-1,5.16

<bracket> <font> Throws down the paper.  <$$font> <$$bracket>
COLLIER-1835-1,5.17

I wonder how my uncle has contrived to pass the time since breakfast;
COLLIER-1835-1,5.18

egad!  he was in a rare ill-humour at Caroline's want of politeness in
not being at home to receive us.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.19

<font> Enter <$$font> Frank, COLLIER-1835-1,5.20

<font> does not observe his master.  <$$font> COLLIER-1835-1,5.21

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Well, I never came into such a rum house as this;
COLLIER-1835-1,5.22

here have we been ever since nine this morning, without meeting a soul
to bid us welcome, COLLIER-1835-1,5.23

and if it $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't} been for the very genteel way in which
I introduced myself to the cook, hang me, if I think I should have had
a mouthful to eat.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.24

The people are all crazed in this house, COLLIER-1835-1,5.25

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} certain.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.26

<font> Cha. <$$font> You think so, do you?  COLLIER-1835-1,5.27

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Beg pardon, sir, COLLIER-1835-1,5.28

$did $n't {TEXT:didn't} observe you.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.29

<font> Cha. <$$font> Well, Frank, has the fair owner of this
mansion returned yet?  COLLIER-1835-1,5.30

<font> Frank.  <$$font> No, sir; COLLIER-1835-1,5.31

and $what $'s {TEXT:what's} more, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} rather uncertain
when she will.  COLLIER-1835-1,5.32

<P_6>

<font> Cha. <$$font> What do you mean?  COLLIER-1835-1,6.34

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Why, sir, the people in the kitchen to whom I
have thought fit to introduce myself, say, that her ladyship set off
with the hounds this morning at day break.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.35

<font> Cha. <$$font> What, gone hunting?  COLLIER-1835-1,6.36

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Yes, sir, COLLIER-1835-1,6.37

and $she $'ll {TEXT:she'll} stick to it as long as her horse has a leg
to stand upon.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.38

<font> Cha. <$$font> Then I have not been misinformed with regard
to her character.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.39

Has she much company with her?  COLLIER-1835-1,6.40

<font> Frank.  <$$font> She $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't} hunt in couples,
believe me, COLLIER-1835-1,6.41

for Betty the cook, says,"half the country are out with her.
"COLLIER-1835-1,6.42

<font> Cha. <$$font> And is she often in the <font> habit <$$font>
COLLIER-1835-1,6.43

- <font> Frank.  <$$font> Lord, love you, sir!  COLLIER-1835-1,6.44

she is never out of it.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.45

<font> Cha. <$$font> I mean in the habit of following the chase.
COLLIER-1835-1,6.46

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Only as often as the hounds are out.
COLLIER-1835-1,6.47

<font> Cha. <$$font> What a singular woman!  COLLIER-1835-1,6.48

yet I have known her very different.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.49

<bracket> <font> Sighs.  <$$font> <$$bracket> COLLIER-1835-1,6.50

<font> Frank.  <$$font> So I have heard you say.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.51

And now all the reports are confirmed, COLLIER-1835-1,6.52

surely a reasonable gentleman, as you are, can never comply with your
uncle's commands to marry such a masculine <font> perverter <$$font>
of petticoats, with nothing but a pretty face to recommend her?
COLLIER-1835-1,6.53

<font> Cha. <$$font> And which she takes care shall be seen too,
COLLIER-1835-1,6.54

for she gallops all over the country to exhibit it.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.55

<font> Frank.  <$$font> $You $'ll {TEXT:You'll} excuse an old servant,
sir; COLLIER-1835-1,6.56

but for my part $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} as soon think of marrying old Nick's
eldest daughter, as such a she dragoon.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.57

<font> Cha. <$$font> And after all she is not most to blame.
COLLIER-1835-1,6.58

Her father, the late Earl, was considered the greatest hunter in the
country; COLLIER-1835-1,6.59

his delight was to inspire her with the same taste; COLLIER-1835-1,6.60

she has profited by his instructions, COLLIER-1835-1,6.61

and if report speaks true, has imbibed a tone of forward familiarity,
only to be acquired from the constant society of men.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.62

<font> Frank.  <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside <$$font> <$$paren> I wish
we were fairly back in town again with all my heart.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.63

<font> Cha. <$$font> But with all her faults I am confident she
possesses sound judgment, true sensibility, and all the requisite virtues
to ensure happiness.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.64

<font> Frank.  <$$font> I declare, sir, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} as deep
in love as ever.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.65

<font> Cha. <$$font> Five years'absence has wrought no change
in me.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.66

Lady Caroline was then a different creature - a dear, delightful girl!
COLLIER-1835-1,6.67

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Change, or no change, marry her you must,
COLLIER-1835-1,6.68

or else your uncle who has set his heart on the match, will disinherit
you.  COLLIER-1835-1,6.69

<P_7>

<font> Cha. <$$font> Well thought of.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.71

Have you seen Sir George since breakfast?  COLLIER-1835-1,7.72

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Indeed I have: COLLIER-1835-1,7.73

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} storming and rating everybody in the house, to know
the meaning of Lady Caroline's strange behaviour.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.74

$He $'s {TEXT:He's} been all over the park, and half over the village
poking his nose into everybody's face enquiring for her ladyship.
COLLIER-1835-1,7.75

But I forgot to tell you, sir, that you will not have to remain long
without company.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.76

<font> Cha. <$$font> Indeed!  COLLIER-1835-1,7.77

who is visible at last - a man, or a muslin?  COLLIER-1835-1,7.78

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Why, Sir, from the cut of the concern, I should
say it was rather doubtful.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.79

<font> Cha. <$$font> $What $'s {TEXT:What's} in the wind now!
COLLIER-1835-1,7.80

<font> Frank.  <$$font> A mere butterfly, sir - as <font> small <$$font>
an <font> apology <$$font> for a <font> man <$$font> as I ever saw in
a pair of indispensables.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.81

I heard one of the servants address <font> it <$$font> by the name of
the Honourable Mr. - Mr. Hector.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.82

<font> Cha. <$$font> $That $'s {TEXT:That's} Lady Caroline's baby
brother, a youth who has been educated under the superintendance of an
old maiden aunt.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.83

<font> Frank.  <$$font>'Pon my life, sir, $we $'re {TEXT:we're} got into
a rare comical family.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.84

<font> Cha. <$$font> $You $'re {TEXT:You're} right for once;
COLLIER-1835-1,7.85

for if this young man has only profited by the lessons of his maiden aunt
, half as well as Lady Caroline has by those of her fox-hunting father,
their society must be most desirable.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.86

<font> Frank.  <$$font> Here the beauty comes, your honor.
COLLIER-1835-1,7.87

<font> Cha. <$$font> Was there ever seen such a timid, embarrassed
looking creature?  COLLIER-1835-1,7.88

he bears some resemblance to his sister.  COLLIER-1835-1,7.89

But, stand aside, COLLIER-1835-1,7.90

I may need your assistance in a trifling scheme I have in view.
COLLIER-1835-1,7.91

Hair quite disordered, COLLIER-1835-1,7.99

<font> Hec. <$$font> What, sister's intended?  COLLIER-1835-1,8.111

<font> Cha. <$$font> The same.  COLLIER-1835-1,8.112

<font> Hec. <$$font> How very strange.  COLLIER-1835-1,8.113

Caroline looked in this morning to ask my aunt's permission to let me
be present at her wedding.  COLLIER-1835-1,8.114

<font> Cha. <$$font> Does she appear pleased at the thought of
being married?  COLLIER-1835-1,8.115

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, my patience!  COLLIER-1835-1,8.116

it is she that does.  COLLIER-1835-1,8.117

She says, Captain Cleveland is such a nice man, rather sedate though,
but that she will soon alter him for the better.  COLLIER-1835-1,8.118

My sister is such a droll one - COLLIER-1835-1,8.119

She was in the stables just now, giving directions about the firing of

<font> Hec. <$$font> Oh, no!  COLLIER-1835-1,8.142

I caught hold of the mane, COLLIER-1835-1,8.143

and stuck to him in gallant style, when turning the corner of a lane,
not five hundred yards off, a d-d brute of a jackass set up such an
infernal yell; COLLIER-1835-1,8.144

horse started of course, COLLIER-1835-1,8.145

and sent me head over heels into a ditch.  COLLIER-1835-1,8.146

Heaven help me!  COLLIER-1835-1,9.174

What pains some people take to make their children ridiculous.
COLLIER-1835-1,9.175

That young man, had his talents been properly cultivated, might

COLLIER-1835-1,9.176

this comes of leaving young men to the guidance of old maiden aunts.
COLLIER-1835-1,9.177

Well, truly, as Frank says, I think I have got into a nice family,
COLLIER-1835-1,9.178

and if the lady answers her description but half as well as her
brother does his, by my honour, but I shall have no easy game to play.
COLLIER-1835-1,9.179

However, I am resolved to try a <font> ruse <$$font> to convince the

the idea is excellent, COLLIER-1835-1,9.181

and should it have the effect of curing my dear Caroline of her defects,
I shall be one of the happiest fellows alive.  COLLIER-1835-1,9.182

But should I fail - pshaw!  COLLIER-1835-1,9.183

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} not think of that, COLLIER-1835-1,9.184

morning favourable - COLLIER-1835-1,13.351

seldom witnessed a finer field for sportsmen.  COLLIER-1835-1,13.352

"Hark to Charmer! "was the Cry - COLLIER-1835-1,13.354

"Charmer has it - COLLIER-1835-1,13.358

being closely pressed, altered his scheme, COLLIER-1835-1,13.366

more horsemen in the river than in the meadows - some stuck fast

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} your man, COLLIER-1835-1,29.1058

and confound me if $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be balked.  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1059

Hang me if I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think the old $cock $'s {TEXT:cock's}

<font> Sir G. <$$font> Thunder and fury!  White feather, indeed!
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1061

Will no one rid me of this she dragon - this <font> Belle Sauvage

<font> Hec. <$$font> Zounds and the devil!  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1063

this is too bad.  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1064

<font> Sir G. <$$font> Hark how she swears!  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1065

<font> Hec. <$$font> After having screwed my courage up to such

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} do something desperate!  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1067

<font> Lady C. <$$font> Well, I declare Hector is courageous
after all!  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1075

what would his aunt say now?  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1076

<font> Hec. <$$font> Courageous, indeed!  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1077

Did I not say $you $'d {TEXT:you'd} rouse the British lion?
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1078

<font> Sir G. <$$font> Will anybody tell me what all this means?
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1079

<font> Cha. <$$font> Yes, uncle, that you have been most grossly
imposed upon: COLLIER-1835-1,29.1080

for here you really behold Lady Caroline Butler, and my intended wife.
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1081

<font> Sir G. <$$font> Then, pray sir, who, is this agreeable
young lady?  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1082

<font> Lady C. <$$font> My own gallant brother, Hector.
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1083

<font> Sir G. <$$font> <paren> <font> Looks confounded.  <$$font>
<$$paren> COLLIER-1835-1,29.1084

Well, I have been made a nice dupe of, COLLIER-1835-1,29.1085

and to have treated Lady Caroline as I have - COLLIER-1835-1,29.1086

<font> Lady C. <$$font> Believe me, Sir George, I freely forgive
all that has passed, COLLIER-1835-1,29.1087

for you have been innocently the cause of exposing many of my defects.
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1088

We shall be good friends in future, I make no doubt.

Bang - bang!  <$$bracket> COLLIER-1835-1,29.1093

That is the way all duels should end.  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1094

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} I that should apologize for the insults you have
suffered: COLLIER-1835-1,29.1096

but, believe me, I was deceived, and by that young gentleman.
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1097

<bracket> <font> Bows.  <$$font> <$$bracket> COLLIER-1835-1,29.1098

Pray, sir, what have you to say for yourself?  COLLIER-1835-1,29.1099

<font> Cha. <$$font> At the dinner table, over a glass of generous
wine, all shall be explained; COLLIER-1835-1,29.1100

for the present, suffice to say, it was to win and wear this lady.
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1101

<font> Sir G. <$$font> I can believe it, COLLIER-1835-1,29.1102

- <bracket> <font> Looks at <$$font> Lady C. <$$bracket>
COLLIER-1835-1,29.1103

Stay, sir, COLLIER-1835-1,30.1107

not quite so fast.  COLLIER-1835-1,30.1108

Your misconduct may have caused some doubts in this house;
COLLIER-1835-1,30.1109

there are many there - <bracket> <font> Points to audience.
<$$font> <$$bracket> - who may yet require further satisfaction.
COLLIER-1835-1,30.1110

Ladies and gentlemen, as I have so often appeared before you as one

inform you that I have no wish to be taken for anything but a woman,
and one $whose {TEXT:who's} sole ambition is to please her friends.
