General Aspects of Commercial Gardening WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.4

<$$heading>

During the past fifty or sixty years horticulture has sprung into a
prominent position as one of the leading industries of the United Kingdom.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.6

Horticulture, unlike its twin sister agriculture, is not represented in
Parliament, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.7

and the only legislative notice taken of it has been to make its disciples
pay rates and taxes on their skill and industry.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.8

When we have a Minister of Horticulture, as the French and Belgians
have, then perhaps the horticultural trade will receive as much
consideration as agriculture does in connection with the rating of the
land, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.9

and more importance will be attached to it as a national industry.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.10

Horticulture, as distinct from agriculture, has to deal with the
cultivation of all kinds of plants and flowers, fruits and vegetables,
both in the open air and under glass.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.11

Besides our native hardy fruits, flowers, and vegetables, the
horticulturist also has to grow exotics from all parts of the world
- from the tropics, subtropics, and temperate regions, from the
mountains and valleys, and from all kinds of soils and situations.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.12

To bring these to perfection necessitates considerable skill, besides
great expense.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.13

The horticulturist has found out that the rather antediluvian methods of
the agriculturist would be of little use to him.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.14

He must mix his soils and composts in various ways to suit particular
crops, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.15

and he must regulate the temperature by means of glasshouses and frames
and hot-water apparatus if he is to succeed.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.16

This necessitates outlay in other directions, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.17

and the timber, glass, and iron trades benefit by his enterprise , as well
as many others that supply horticultural sundries.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.18

Indeed it is almost impossible to describe the intricate details of
horticultural practice, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.19

and it must suffice to say that they are such as would astonish the
average agriculturist.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.20

Although both farmer and gardener have to practise the same principles
of cultivation for outdoor crops, the gardener, even with these, will
devote far more attention to detail, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.21

and will spend an amount of money every year in cultivation that the
farmer would consider exorbitant or extravagant.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,1.22

The farmer leaves <P_1,2> a good deal to nature; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.23

but the gardener, and especially the commercial gardener, $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} afford to leave his various crops altogether exposed to
the mercies of a somewhat fickle climate.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.24

He prepares his soil to a greater depth, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.25

and feeds it more richly with manure than does the farmer;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.26

and he also pays greater attention to cultural details.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.27

In addition, he must gather his crops, not for cattle, but for human
consumption, just when they are ready, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.28

and he must pack them in such a way that they will readily attract buyers
in the markets.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.29

At one time, indeed, the market gardener was little better than a farmer
in his cultural and business methods, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.30

and he sent produce to market in a very slipshod manner.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.31

The stress of competition at home and the importations from abroad,
however, have completely changed the methods of the modern market grower.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.32

He has found out by experience that the finer, better, and cleaner his
produce, and the better it is packed or displayed, the higher the prices
and the quicker the sales.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.33

He has learnt much in these respects from the way produce from
the Colonies and from the Continent is placed on the markets,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.34

and he realizes that good stuff badly displayed will often fetch miserably
low prices.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.35

This work on commercial gardening deals principally with those classes
of plants that are grown in large quantities either in the open air or
under glass for sale in the London and provincial markets, and also those
that are grown by nurserymen and hardy-plantsmen in fairly large numbers
to meet the demands of their customers who do not patronize the markets.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.36

There are, indeed, so many ramifications of the horticultural trade,
each intimately associated with the other, and dependent on each other
, that it may be well to say a few words about each to show how one is
linked up with the other.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.37

The Seed Trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.38

- This branch of commercial gardening has assumed immense proportions
of late years.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.39

In various parts of the kingdom firms have established trial grounds
where their seeds are not only saved, but where new varieties likely to
have a ready sale are also tested and proved before being placed upon
the market.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.40

This work necessitates great care and cultural skill;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.41

and expensive machinery, driven by steam or the more modern electricity
, is used to cleanse the seeds from impurities of every sort.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.42

Large warehouses have to be built to accommodate the stocks, not only
of home-saved seed, but also of that imported from sunnier climes than
our own.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.43

To give some idea as to the trade done in seeds it is only necessary to
state that one firm alone sells each year about 50,000 bus. of
culinary Peas: 51,000 bus. of root-crop seeds; 6500 bus. of
Beans; 41 tons of seeds of the various Cabbage crops; 1300 bus.
of Radish seeds; 25 tons of Beet seed; 1400 bus. of Spinach
seed; 10 tons of Onion seed; 17 tons of Carrot seed; 220 bus.
of Parsley seed; 10 tons of Parsnip seed; 15 tons of Sweet Pea seed;
14 tons of Nasturtium <paren> Tropaeolum <$$paren> seed; and 3 tons of
Mignonette seed.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.44

Seeds of annuals, biennials, and perennials of all kinds are sold in
large quantities year after year, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.45

and are retailed in packets costing from 1 <font> d. <$$font>
upwards.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,2.46

<P_1,3>

The Bulb Trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.48

- Although a large proportion of the bulb trade is undoubtedly Continental
, there has been a magnificent effort on the part of British and Irish
growers to produce large quantities at home.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.49

While such bulbs as Hyacinths and Tulips and Daffodils have been for
generations a staple industry of the Dutch growers, signs are not
wanting that equally good bulbs can be grown in several places in the
United Kingdom.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.50

With the exception perhaps of Hyacinths, other bulbs of a hardy nature
might be grown more extensively.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.51

In the Channel Islands and the Scilly Islands, in parts of Ireland and
England, Tulip and Daffodil bulbs are now grown on a large scale and of
the finest quality, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.52

but the methods of British growers in calling attention to their stocks
are far inferior to those adopted by the Dutch.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.53

The latter band themselves together for mutual trade benefit,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.54

and make a point of encouraging visits to their bulb farms every season.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.55

The trade practically commences in the spring, when Dutch growers book
orders from the visiting growers, and deliver the goods as early in
autumn as possible.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.56

During the summer months - from May to August - their travellers invade
the British Islands and America, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.57

and push the bulb trade so well that they take home fine fat orders for
early autumn delivery.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.58

From September to December the trade is brisk amongst retailers, while
the market grower has already boxed his bulbs of Tulips, Daffodils,
Hyacinths, Crocuses, Snowdrops, &c., to secure an early Christmas
and Easter trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.59

Tulips, Daffodils, Hyacinths, and Crocuses are abundant from Christmas
to Easter; while <font> Lilium longiflorum <$$font> is now practically
in season throughout the year.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.60

Gladioli of the Colvillei and nanus sections are also useful for spring
work, while the Brenchleyensis, Childsi, and Nanceianus sections come
in for late summer or early autumn work.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.61

Apart from bulbs proper, such tuberous-rooted plants as Arum Lilies are
in great request from Christmas to Easter and Whitsuntide, the chief
trade being done in the blooms or spathes.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.62

Ixias, Freesias, Snowdrops, German, Spanish, and English Irises,
Tuberoses, Montbretias, Solomon's Seal, Crown Imperials, Herbaceous
Paesonies, Eucharis, Dahlias, &c., are amongst other bulbous and
tuberous plants that find a ready sale throughout the year at their own
particular season, for the cut-flower trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.63

Each group is dealt with in its proper place in Vol. II of
this work.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.64

Amongst retail nurserymen and bulb merchants other bulbous and tuberous
plants dealt in, as well as those mentioned, are Begonias, Dicentras,
Gloxinias, Hippeastrum, Leucojum, Chionodoxa, Scilla, Alstroemeria,
Brodiaea, Brevoortia, Galtonia, Haemanthus, Ranunculus , Winter
Aconite <paren> Eranthis <$$paren>, Calochortus, Camassia, Colchicum,
Erythronium or Dog's Tooth Violet, Eremurus, Incarvillea, Ixiolirion,
Lyeoris, Milla or Triteleia, Muscari or Grape Hyacinth, Ornithogalum
or Star of Bethlehem, and many others, including the Water Lilies or
Nymphaeas which have become popular of late years.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.65

Most of these are practically hardy, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,3.66

and the trade in them is confined to nurserymen and hardy-plantsmen
who <P_1,4> deal with the owners of private establishments.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.67

Each genus is dealt with amongst the"Plants and Flowers"in Vol. II.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.68

The Hardy-plant Trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.69

- Of late years the trade in hardy plants has assumed almost gigantic
proportions.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.70

Not only are large quantities of hardy herbaceous perennials actually
sent to the various markets for sale packed in various ways and sold as
"roots", WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.71

but a still larger trade is done through the post, by means of
exhibitions, and by advertising in the papers.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.72

Owing to the cost of erecting glasshouses, the cost of fuel, and other
items of expense many private people have discarded glass altogether,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.73

or the newer generation has not taken a fancy to it owing to the trouble
and expense.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.74

To such, the hardy herbaceous perennials, and hardy annuals and biennials,
naturally appeal with great force.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.75

There is no need to have glasshouses of any description to grow these
plants, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.76

and even a cold frame can be dispensed with; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.77

and yet a magnificent display may be secured by a judicious selection of
plants that will flourish in the open air in most parts of the kingdom
without any artificial protection.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.78

This being the case, it is not to be wondered at that a large trade has
sprung up in these plants, and something like three or four thousand
different species are now dealt in by various growers, some of whom
hold valuable stocks of the best-selling kinds, while others cater
for a select group of plant connoisseurs and botanical establishments.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.79

The grower of hardy plants, as a rule, does not go to market,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.80

and his methods of business are quite different from those of the
market grower.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.81

He relies very largely for his sales upon his catalogues <paren> which
are often works of art <$$paren>, upon exhibitions in all parts of the
kingdom, and upon judicious advertising, very much in the same way as
the seedsman and bulb merchant do.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.82

Thousands of people now interested in gardening will gladly pay
a reasonable price for a plant in which they are interested,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.83

and they will visit flower shows and exhibitions in the hope of seeing
something new, or something they would like to have in their collection.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.84

The hardy-plantsmen, therefore, who make a practice of displaying their
specialities at the various exhibitions up and down the country stand an
excellent chance of making new customers if they exhibit really choice
and well-grown stuff, and set it up with all the art of window dressing.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.85

The old style of jumbling plants up"anyhow"at an exhibition is no longer
sufficient.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.86

The exhibitor adopts various devices, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.87

and when space permits he makes miniature herbaceous borders, rock
gardens, water gardens, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.88

and he arranges his goods in such an artistic way that the would-be
purchaser is at once captivated, and longs to produce a similar floral
picture in his own garden.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.89

This naturally leads not only to the sale of plants, but also to the
engagement of landscapemen, who know how to turn a piece of waste land
into a smiling flower garden.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.90

Many firms now make a speciality of laying out gardens artistically and
naturally, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.91

and although some amateurs try their untrained hands at the business,
they generally have to call in the aid of the man who knows his plants
and their nature and uses by everyday intercourse and experience.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,4.92

<P_1,5>

While exhibiting is one of the best means of doing business for the grower
of hardy plants, it must be remembered that it entails a large expense.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.94

The mere carriage of the plants by rail or road, apart from hotel and
other expenses, often means a substantial sum, the recovery of which
will depend largely upon the weather and upon the class of visitors to
the exhibition.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.95

Some growers of hardy plants rarely exhibit, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.96

but rely upon the post and advertisements to dispose of their goods.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.97

Hundreds of thousands of young plants and cuttings are sent through
the post to the most remote parts of the kingdom, to fill orders
that have come to hand as the result of reading an advertisement.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.98

Some, indeed, spend from +L50 to +L100 a week during the season in
advertising alone, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.99

and this will give some idea as to the volume of the trade.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.100

Not only are hardy plants disposed of rapidly in this way, but also
half-hardy and tender plants during the season, as may be seen by
referring to the advertisement columns of the trade and amateur papers.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.101

From what has been said it will be gathered that the great trade in hardy
plants of all kinds, and in seeds and cuttings, as well as in bulbous
and tuberous plants, is largely done by means of judicious advertising.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.102

The plant grower not only supports the newspapers, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.103

but he also places large orders with the printers for thousands of
catalogues that are issued broadcast, but not without considerable
expense.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.104

Some of the larger firms issue as many as eighty thousand beautifully
prepared catalogues every year, weighing in the aggregate from 90 to
100 tons; while smaller men print and distribute catalogues according
to their means.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.105

In all cases, however, the General Post Office, the printers, and
newspaper proprietors have had the first pick at the seedsman's or
hardy-plantsman's purse, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.106

and he is left to settle his account with a more or less fickle public.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.107

The Nursery Trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.108

- This branch of commercial gardening has extensive ramifications all
over the kingdom.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.109

All kinds of plants, fruits, flowers, and vegetables are grown for sale
in the open or under glass, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.110

and thousands of gardeners are employed to propagate and grow them.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.111

There are many special branches in the nursery trade.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.112

Thus some make a speciality of Roses, some of fruit trees, some of
ornamental trees and shrubs, some of stove and greenhouse plants,
some of Ferns, some of Orchids, some chiefly of forest trees, some of
hardy herbaceous perennials and alpines, and rock and water plants -
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.113

and perhaps not one of these nurserymen ever sends a plant to a market.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.114

The nurseryman is quite distinct in his methods of trading from the
market grower and the market gardener.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.115

He makes a speciality of various classes of plants,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.116

and has every nook and corner of the globe ransacked by horticultural
travellers, who are on the lookout for any new plant likely to attract
attention.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.117

Besides pushing his trade by means of travellers, advertisements, and
catalogues, the nurseryman proper also relies largely upon exhibitions.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,5.118

These are held regularly not only in London, where the finest class of
trade is done, but in almost every town of any importance in the kingdom ,
<P_1,6> at different periods of the year.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.119

In some cases exhibitions on the Continent are also visited,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.120

and in this way some firms have worked up a large international or
cosmopolitan trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.121

These exhibitions naturally cost much money, not only for transport
, but for the maintenance and lodging of the necessary staff;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.122

and it is essential to reap a good harvest in the way of orders to
enable one to pay the expenses and leave a balance on the right side.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.123

Market Gardening and Market Growing.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.124

- The business of the market gardener and the market grower is different
in a technical sense.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.125

The market gardener proper, as a rule, grows fruits and vegetables on a
large scale in the same way that the farmer grows corn and root crops.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.126

If he indulges in glass at all it is a few frames at the most to raise
early supplies of seedlings to put out at the first favourable opportunity
in spring; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.127

or he may use bell glasses or clothes to protect his early cauliflowers
and marrows, much in the same way as the French cultivators do.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.128

Market gardening has been a great industry in the Thames valley for
generations, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.129

and notwithstanding the operations of the builder, and the enormous
growth of the London suburbs, there is still a large area around the
metropolis devoted to market gardening.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.130

Of course the market gardener is being pushed farther and farther out,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.131

but with improved methods of transit, and better roads, the man twenty
or thirty miles from London is probably in as good a position as his
predecessor was fifty or sixty years ago, when only a dozen miles from
Covent Garden.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.132

Old market-garden districts like Deptford, Fulham, and Chelsea have been
wiped out by the builder, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.133

and buildings and roads now take the place of cabbages, rhubarb, fruit
trees and bushes that not so many years ago made those neighbourhoods
truly rural.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.134

This pressure from the centre has naturally driven the market gardener
farther out, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.135

and such places as Feltham, Ashford, Sipson, Staines, West Drayton
, Harmondsworth, Bedfont, Shepperton, Stanwell, and Cranford, in
Middlesex, are becoming covered with fruit and vegetable gardens.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.136

Kent, Surrey, and Essex are being invaded in much the same way,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.137

and there seems to be a tendency to increase the acreage under these
crops.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.138

From Mortlake to Richmond and Petersham, on the south side of the Thames ,
market gardens still exist, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.139

but it will probably not be for very long.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.140

Chiswick, on the north bank, still contains some of its ancient market
gardens, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.141

and these extend to Brentford, Isleworth, Heston, and Hounslow;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.142

but in these famous market-garden areas the builder is rapidly covering
the ground with bricks and mortar.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.143

The vale of Evesham in Worcestershire has become famous as a centre,
not only for the market culture of fruits and vegetables, but also as
the first place in the British Islands where"intensive cultivation"
as practised around Paris was established.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.144

For particulars of this system the reader is referred to Vol. IV.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.145

While the market gardener is seeking fresh fields for his labours,
the market grower who brings his crops to maturity under glass has
come very much to the front during the past thirty or forty years.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,6.146

<P_1,7>

There are now enormous areas of glasshouses erected all round the
Metropolis, but more especially to the north in such places as Edmonton,
Ponder's End, Enfield, Waltham Cross; in the north-west round Finchley,
Whetstone, and Potter's Bar; and to the west at Isleworth, Foltham,
Hillingdon, Uxbridge, Sipson, and West Drayton.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.148

In other parts of the kingdom, notably Worthing and the Channel Islands
<paren> principally Guernsey <$$paren>, large areas of ground have also
been covered with glass.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.149

This has naturally led to the development of other businesses, such as
the timber trade and the iron trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.150

Glasshouses are now built on quite different principles from what they
were twenty or thirty years ago, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.151

and growers are at last beginning to realize the great value of light
to their crops, and to appreciate structures that will allow the maximum
amount of sunshine through the glass.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.152

Less wood and more glass is now the rule.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.153

In the iron trade, enormous quantities of material are used for the
manufacture of boilers and pipes; while the manufacturers of paint,
putty, and other materials also do a brisk trade with market growers.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.154

To these must be added the various gas companies and colliery merchants
, who provide thousands of tons of coke or anthracite coal to feed the
furnaces attached to the glasshouses.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.155

The crops grown under glass are naturally of a quite different nature
from those grown in the open air.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.156

They require greater care and skill in cultivation,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.157

and frequent changes are made in accordance with the alterations in
fashion or the fluctuations of the market.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.158

Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Grapes, Ferns, Palms, Aspidistras, Chrysanthemums,
bedding plants, Melons, Peaches, constitute some of the chief crops
grown extensively under glass, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.159

and they are all dealt with in their proper places in Vols. II,
III, and IV of this work.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.160

Such outdoor crops, however, as Cabbages, Lettuces, Radishes, Mint ,
Rhubarb, Sea Kale, Dwarf and Runner Beans, Marrows, &c., are also
now grown extensively under glass by many to supply the early markets and
thus pander to the fashion of having everything in as early as possible
before its natural period.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.161

Notwithstanding the numbers of market growers who now send produce to
the London and provincial markets, it is astonishing to see the enormous
quantities of fruits, flowers, and vegetables that are imported from
the Continent and the Colonies.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.162

The increased speed of trains and steamboats now renders it possible to
bring supplies to market that a few years ago would have been considered
impossible.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.163

The introduction of the refrigerating system on trains and steamboats
has still further aided the introduction of colonial and foreign produce
to British markets - one of the surest signs that they are the most
lucrative in the world.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.164

If they were not, supplies would soon cease, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.165

and trade would flow to the markets where the"biggest penny"was to
be secured.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.166

The Florist Trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.167

- There is scarcely a town of any pretensions in the British Islands that
does not boast of at least one florist's shop.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.168

In large provincial towns there are many, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.169

and in the metropolis itself and its suburbs there are many hundreds.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,7.170

The floral trade has developed <P_1,8> enormously during the past twenty
or thirty years, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.171

and the florists'shops are the main outlets for most of the decorative
plants and flowers grown, by market nurserymen.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.172

It would indeed be a poor prospect for the latter if the business of the
florist was interfered with or hampered by increased burdens of taxation.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.173

The more florists there are in the country the better for the growers
of plants and flowers.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.174

Incidentally, the florists'shops are a sign of the general prosperity
of the people, because their trade may be regarded more in the
light of a luxury of art and taste than as an actual necessity.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.175

The business carried on by the florist is of a varied character.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.176

He is an adept at the making of bouquets of all kinds for weddings or
Court functions.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.177

Wreaths, crosses, anchors, pillars, cushions, and numerous other floral
emblems for the departed also come within his sphere of influence ,
in addition to which he sells masses of cut flowers in a natural
state, as well as decorative pot plants, little shrubs, &c.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.178

And where the florist happens to be also a nurseryman, he undertakes
landscape work and jobbing.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.179

In all these operations his raw material consists of plants and flowers
of all descriptions, hardy and tender, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.180

and he is ever on the watch to invent new designs, or to arrange his
flowers, &c., in such a way that they will attract attention and
excite admiration.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.181

Some of the leading London florists have made their names famous by
the taste and original ideas they display not only in the making of
wreaths, bouquets, &c., but in the artistic way they decorate
or furnish banquet halls, theatres, reception rooms, &c.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.182

All important public functions in any town or city lead to business
being done by the florist; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.183

and he who displays the greatest taste, originality, and industry is
the one most likely to be patronized.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.184

The florist and furnishing trade indeed $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be
learned in a day.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.185

Many an excellent grower of plants and flowers used in floral decorations
would make but a sorry job of it if he had to arrange his own produce
for a public function.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.186

It takes years to become an expert florist, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.187

and in some branches of the trade, such as the making of wreaths,
bouquets, &c., women stand as good a chance as men, if not
a better.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.188

The operator must be not only skilful and quick in"mounting "the flowers
on various kinds of wires and"foundations", WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.189

but must display considerable taste in the arrangement of the individual
flowers, and of their effects upon one another.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.190

It is quite possible for the choicest flowers to be as easily spoiled in
effect in the hands of an incompetent florist as it is for good viands to
be spoiled in the hands of an incompetent cook.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.191

A skilled florist will produce a finer effect with a few inexpensive
blossoms than an unskilled one will with a cartload of choice
material , just as some women can dress charmingly at little expense
while others will look dowdy in the finest materials and jewellery.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.192

There is no end to learning in the florist's business,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.193

and the fashion of to-day may be out of date to-morrow.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,8.194

Great and wonderful changes have taken place within the past thirty
years in the way flowers are <P_1,9> arranged.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.195

Formerly bouquets were made in a round, flat, and dumpy style, having
row after row of flowers arranged in circles round the centrepiece.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.196

The whole arrangement was flat and formal, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.197

and was finished up with a collar of fancy paper.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.198

This heavy style of bouquet has long since disappeared,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.199

and a lighter and more graceful arrangement has taken its place.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.200

This has been brought about by the introduction of different kinds of
flowers and trailing plants, and the different methods of sending them
to market.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.201

Twenty and thirty years ago nearly all flowers were cut with very short
stalks, so that the florist, to produce any effect at all, was obliged
to mount many of them on wires to raise them above their neighbours.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.202

In these days, however, florists insist on having flowers with the
natural stems as long as possible, so that a variety of designs is more
easily obtained.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.203

The grower who would now send short-stemmed Roses or Carnations to
market would find his wares on his hands when the market closed.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.204

With some classes of flowers, such as Camellias, Tuberoses, and Eucharis,
it is impossible to supply long stems to the individual flowers,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.205

and what they lack in this respect must be made up by the florist in
other ways.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.206

Amongst the most important of the florist's accessories are wires of
various kinds, and moss for the foundations of wreaths, crosses, anchors,
and other emblems.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.207

The stiffish wires used for mounting flowers are known as stubs,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.208

and are of varying length and thickness, according to the purposes for
which they are required.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.209

Special wires are also used for the mounting of Roses, Camellias,
Tuberoses, &c., WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.210

and it takes some considerable time for the beginner to find out, not
only the proper stubs and wires to be used for certain purposes, but
to acquire that manual dexterity which distinguishes the expert from
the tyro.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.211

The foundations of various sizes and shapes are made of strong galvanized
wire by the horticultural sundriesman, so that they will not bend or
twist when in use.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.212

These foundations are covered with soft moss tied on with string or wire
, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.213

and into the moss the flowers, mounted on wires or stubs, are stuck.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.214

Years ago, before the use of stubs became common, flowers were tied down
to the moss foundations, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.215

and the general effect was flat and unrelieved.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.216

Nowadays, however, flowers can be arranged in various styles - some flat,
some slightly raised, some bunched boldly in certain places and forming
the <font> pie`ce de re`sistance <$$font> of the whole work - all of
which variations depend upon the artistic perceptions of the operator.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.217

Owing to the more frequent interchange between British and Continental
florists now than formerly, constant changes are taking place,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.218

and one notices how largely the ideas of the Continental florists
are being assimilated by their British brethren, and vice versa.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.219

<font> Popular Florists'Flowers.  <$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.220

- Perhaps the florist attaches more importance to the colour than to
the form of the flowers he uses in his business.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.221

As a rule, flowers with clear and distinct shades of colour are most
appreciated; while those with confused tones or lacking in brilliancy
are practically useless.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,9.222

A colour that will not show up well at nighttime under <P_1,10> gas-light
or electric light is of little use, because a good deal of the florist's
art is seen under these conditions.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.223

<font> White Flowers.  <$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.224

- Taking the colours all in all, white is undoubtedly the most popular ,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.225

and enormous quantities of white-flowered plants must be grown to meet
the ever-increasing demand.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.226

Amongst the most important plants used for a supply of white flowers
to the florists the following may be mentioned: Lily of the Valley;
<font> Lilium longiflorum <paren> Harriai <$$paren> <$$font>; <font>
Lilium speciosum <$$font> or <font> lancifolium album <$$font>;
<font> Eucharis grandiflora <$$font>; Camellias; Tuberoses <paren>
<font> Palianthes <$$font> <$$paren>; <font> Freesia refracta alba
<$$font>; Tulip, La Reine; Roman Hyacinths; Florists'Hyacinth, La
Grandesse; <font> Gladiolus Colvillei <$$font>, The Bride; Stephanotis;
<font> Lapageria alba <$$font>; Bouvardia; Rose, Niphetos; Gardenias;
Carnations; Phlox; Chrysanthemums; Dahlias; China Asters; Stocks; Azaleas;
Pink, Mrs. Simkins and Her Majesty; Zonal Pelargonium Hermione
<paren> double <$$paren>; Gloxinias; Snowdrops; Paper-white Narcissus;
Star of Bethlehem <paren> <font> Ornithogalum <$$font> <$$paren>;
<font> Odontoglossum crispum <$$font>; Christmas Roses <paren> <font>
Helleborus niger <$$font> <$$paren>; Arum Lilies <paren> <font> Richardia
<$$font> <$$paren>; <font> Hoteia <$$font> <paren> <font> Spiroea <$$font>
<$$paren> <font> japonica <$$font>; <font> Gypsophila paniculata <$$font>
and <font> G. elegans; Achillea <$$font>, The Pearl; Sweet Peas;
Spanish Iris; Florentine Iris; Paeonies; <font> Phaloenopsis grandiflora,
umabilis, Riemstedtiana, <$$font> &c. WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.227

Apart from white, flowers of all other colours are utilized in great
abundance, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.228

and the principal kinds used may be noted as follows: Roses of all
kinds; Violets, double and single; Carnations - Perpetual and Border
varieties; Daffodils and Narcissi; Tulips; Hyacinths; Gladiolus; Dahlias;
Chrysanthemums; Phlox; Forget-me-nots; Zonal Pelargonium Raspail,
double scarlet; Orchids such as Cattleyas, Dendrobiums, Oncidiums,
Odontoglossums, Leelias, and Phalaenopsis.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.229

<font> Trailers.  <$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.230

- For"shower"bouquets, festoons, and table decorations it is useful to
have certain plants with slender trailing stems and foliage that will
not soon wither.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.231

Amongst the best plants for this purpose are <font> Asparagus Sprengeri
<$$font>, <font> A. plumosus <$$font>, and <font> A.
plumosus nanus <$$font> <paren> all known as Asparagus"Ferns"<$$paren>
, <font> A. medeoloides <$$font> <paren> or <font> Myrsiphyllum
asparagoides <$$font> <$$paren> far better known to florists as"Smilax
".  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.232

A great trade is done in the trails of these plants,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.233

and some growers make a speciality of their culture.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.234

<font> Foliage.  <$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.235

- For backing up many flowers used in wreaths, crosses, bouquets,
&c., it is sometimes essential to have foliage that will throw
the blossoms into greater relief, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.236

and a large number of plants are grown for this purpose.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.237

Until the various kinds of Asparagus were introduced, the fronds of the
Maidenhair Fern were used in enormous quantities for almost everything.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.238

Of late years, however, the foliage of other plants has been utilized ,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.239

and florists now stock in the proper season the leaves of such plants
as: Crotons, Maples, Holly-leaved Barberry <paren> <font> Berberis
Aquifolium <$$font> <$$paren>, Copper Beech, Ivy, Copper Hazel, Purple
Plum, Scarlet Oak, <font> Galax aphylla <$$font>, large-leaved Myrtle,
&c., to which must be added for winter work sprays of Mistletoe
and of Holly in leaf and berry.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.240

There is still a great trade done in what is known as"French Fern
"<paren> <font> Asplenium $adiantum $nigrum {TEXT:adiantum_niqrum}
<$$font> <$$paren>, the fronds of which are sold in bunches.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,10.241

The old conventional <P_1,11> ideas, however, are gradually vanishing ,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.242

and it is now customary to use the natural foliage of any flower that
may be used in floral work.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.243

Thus violet leaves are most appropriately used with violet blossoms,
as holly leaves are the most suitable adjuncts to the scarlet berries.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.244

Indeed there is no end to the methods employed by the modern florist to
produce a charming effect; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.245

and the plant and flower grower who will introduce a new plant, or suggest
a novel idea, is looked upon as a floral friend.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.246

Tree and Shrub Trade.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.247

- This is a very important branch of commercial horticulture , and one
about which the general public knows but little.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.248

It may be divided into two principal groups, viz.: <paren>
1 <$$paren> that dealing with forest trees, and <paren> 2 <$$paren>
ornamental flowering trees and shrubs.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.249

In regard to forest trees it is astonishing - what an enormous number
of young plants are raised every year in different parts of England,
Ireland, and Scotland.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.250

Those who are under the impression that British forestry is a dead or
dying industry have no idea as to the amount of business done in forest
trees, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.251

and it is a pity that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the officials
of the Board of Agriculture are not better informed as to what is being
done in this respect.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.252

There are hundreds of capable men, who could not only plant all the waste
land in the United Kingdom in a comparatively short time, but who could
produce millions of young forest trees annually to fill the gaps that
might occur.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.253

And yet Mr. Lloyd George, when introducing his famous 1909
Budget, said in reference to the scheme of afforestation:"I am also
told that we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} command the services in this
country of a sufficient number of skilled foresters to direct planting.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.254

I am advised, and, personally, I am disposed to accept that counsel as
the advice of prudence, that the great haste in this matter will mean
the less speed, and that to rush into planting on a huge scale without
first of all making the necessary experiments, organizing a trained body
of foresters, and taking all other essential steps to ensure success
when you advance, would be to court disaster which might discourage all
future attempts. "WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.255

It would be interesting to know whose advice the Chancellor of the
Exchequer relied upon when he stated that"we $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
command the services in this country of a sufficient number of skilled
foresters to direct planting", WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.256

but there was no doubt about its misleading character.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.257

We wonder what kind of men they are who raise and plant thousands of
forest trees annually?  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.258

Have they no knowledge of the trees they raise, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.259

and are they not skilled in planting and growing them?
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.260

The Chancellor's somewhat misleading statement is calculated to injure
the reputation of a large number of skilful and hard-working men who earn
a living by carrying out the very duties which the Chancellor was advised
were not and could not at present be performed.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.261

These men, skilled in the raising, planting, and cultivation of forest
trees, may not, of course, be able to pass an examination in Greek and
Latin, or in Conic Sections and Trigonometry, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.262

nor have they had the disadvantage of a"public-school training";
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.263

but they know their business, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,11.264

and if the Chancellor of the Exchequer will only <P_1,12> start the
Government Afforestation Scheme at once, he will find plenty of skilful
foresters who will see that the preparation and planting of the 17,000,000
acres of waste ground in the United Kingdom are carried out properly.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.265

<font> Raising Forest Trees.  <$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.266

- The simplest method of raising these is from seeds.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.267

These are collected when ripe in autumn and carefully stored until
the spring.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.268

In some cases, however, like - the Willow, Poplar, Elm, in which the
seed ripens early, sowing may take place during the summer months.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.269

The seed land is prepared by ploughing or digging, and harrowing and
raking, until it is brought to a fine tilth.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.270

Drills are then drawn at regular distances apart, varying from 3
in. to 12 in. according to the kind of seed that is sown,
each kind being covered with three or four times its own depth of soil,
and afterwards lightly rolled.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.271

In some cases seeds are sown broadcast over beds about 5 ft. wide
, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.272

but generally speaking it is more economical, and better for the
seedlings, to sow thinly in drills.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.273

To allow for cultural attention like weeding, hoeing, watering,
&c., the seedbeds should not be more than 4 to 5 ft. wide ,
with an alley between, so that half the seed-bed may be attended to from
one side and half from the other without having to tread upon the soil
between the plants.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.274

The forest and other trees raised in large quantities from seed are Oaks,
Beeches, Birches, Ashes, Poplars, Sweet Chestnuts, Horse Chestnuts, Elms,
Hollies, Hawthorns, Hornbeams, Limes, Mountain Ashes, Planes, Sycamores,
False Acacias <paren> Robinia <$$paren>, Maidenhair Trees <paren>
Gingko <$$paren>, Willows, Tulip Trees <paren> Liriodendron <$$paren>,
and such conifers as the Firs, Spruces, Pines, the Arbor Vitae, Cedars,
Thuyas, Larches, Cypresses, &c. WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.275

Apart from the forest trees, there are hundreds of others of a
more ornamental character, chiefly used for the decoration of large
parks and gardens, public places and squares, streets, &c.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.276

These are raised not only from seeds in the same way as forest trees,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.277

but in the case of special varieties, or when seeds are not ripened
in abundance, they are also raised by means of cuttings, layers, buds,
grafts, and suckers.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.278

The most important plants in this group and in the forest section are
dealt with in Vol. II in the article on"Trees and Shrubs", to
which the reader is referred.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.279

Of late years a great trade has sprung up, chiefly amongst nurserymen,
in ornamental flowering shrubs, which are grown in pots and gently forced
into early bloom in Spring <paren> January to March and April <$$paren>.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.280

The principal plants thus grown are Lilacs, Double Cherries, Azaleas,
Almonds, Japanese Quinces, Wistaria, Double Plums, <font> Cydonia Maulei
<$$font>, <font> Pyrus spectabilis <$$font>, <font> Deutzia gracilis
<$$font>, <font> Staphyllea colchica <$$font>, <font> Prunus triloba
<$$font>, <font> Magnolia Soulangeana <$$font>, <font> Forsythia suspensa
<$$font>, <font> Ribes sanguineum <$$font> , &c. &c.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.281

A trade also has sprung up again in clipped trees and shrubs of an
evergreen character.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.282

Such trees as the Box and the Yew, the Poet's Laurel, and others are
cut into various shapes, some more or less fantastic - as shown in the
photograph <paren> fig. 1 <$$paren>.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.283

They are usually grown in tubs, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.284

and are utilized for what some people call decoration, but others
desecration, of large gardens.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,12.285

<P_1,13>

Japanese Gardening.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,13.287

- Although the introduction of the beautiful Japanese plants that now
contribute to the charm of British gardens belongs to the distant past
, it was not until some fifty years ago that commercial cultivators
gave serious attention to the Japanese flora, with a view to obtain
some other of its members for the further enrichment of our gardens.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,13.288

If until the middle of the last century Japan was not exactly a
sealed book to the seeker after new forms of tree and plant life, the
restrictions imposed upon the members of other nationalities were such
as to render it extremely difficult for them to obtain access to the
country, much less to explore meadow or woodland, or plain or mountain
, and bring away on their return home the spoils of the exploration.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,13.289

The removal of these restrictions by the opening of the Japanese ports
to foreigners rather more than half a century ago gave <P_1,14> the
desired opportunity for collecting some of the many beautiful trees,
shrubs, and other plants that were likely to succeed under the climatic
conditions that obtain in the United Kingdom, and placing them at the
disposal of the general body of plant lovers.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.290

Then as now the nursery firms of this country were remarkable for their
enterprise, and therefore not slow to take advantage of the opportunity
thus given them for enriching gardens with new and beautiful forms of
plant life.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.291

As a proof of this one example will be sufficient.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.292

In April, 1860, the late John Gould Veitch, a member of the
well-known Chelsea firm, left England on a voyage to the Far East,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.293

and arrived at Nagasaki in the July following.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.294

He remained in Japan about twelve months, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.295

and during that period he sent home a large number of trees, shrubs,
and bulbous and other plants, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.296

and of these the greater proportion have proved of so high a degree of
value as to obtain a place in gardens generally.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.297

Coniferous trees included <font> Abies firma <$$font>, <font> A.
microsperma <$$font>, <font> Cryptomeria japonica elegans <$$font>
, <font> Juniperus chinensis aurea <$$font>, <font> Larix leptolepis
<$$font>, <font> Picea Alcockiana <$$font>, <font> P. ajanensis
<$$font>, <font> P. polita <$$font>, <font> Pinus densiflora
<$$font>, <font> P. parviflora <$$font>, <font> P.
Thunbergi <$$font>, and the varieties of <font> Retinospora obtusa.
<$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.298

The deciduous trees included the varieties of <font> Acer palmatum
<$$font>, the climber <font> Ampelopsis tricuspidata <$$font> <paren>
or <font> Vitis inconstans <$$font> <$$paren>, and the plants <font>
Lilium auratum <$$font>, <font> Primula japonica <$$font> and <font>
P. cortusioides.  <$$font> WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.299

The introduction of so many kinds of first-rate importance within so
short a period evinces much enterprise, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.300

for travelling in Japan was very different in those days from what it
is at the present time.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.301

The Abies, Cryptomeria, Piceas, and Pinus represent species that rank
high in their respective genera, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.302

and the varieties of <font> Retinospora obtusa <$$font> are so diversified
in form and colour, and withal so attractive, that they have throughout
the period that has elapsed since their introduction enjoyed a high degree
of popularity and have been freely used in the creation of garden scenery.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.303

The varieties of <font> Acer palmatum <$$font>, in the varied form
and colour of their elegant foliage, are recognized as forming a
group of small-growing trees of immense value for garden decoration;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.304

and <font> Ampelopsis tricuspidata <$$font> is used more largely
in clothing wall surfaces than all the other climbers combined,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.305

and it contributes in no small degree to the amenities of town life.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.306

The richly coloured <font> Primula japonica <$$font> continues to be
highly appreciated as one of the best of the moisture-loving plants for
fringing streamlet and pool in shady positions, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.307

and as the result of the activities of various commercial horticulturists
the varieties of <font> Primula cortusioides <$$font> have been so
multiplied as to form a large group in which there is so great a range of
colour as to greatly enhance their value for various decorative purposes
both under glass and in the open.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.308

The plants thus briefly enumerated rapidly came into favour.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.309

They were largely used, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.310

and soon made an impression on the scenery of gardens where novelties
of merit received a welcome.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.311

They greatly enhanced the interest and attractions of gardens in which
they were given a place, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.312

and as a result they greatly stimulated an interest in Japanese plants,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,14.313

and <P_1,15> gave rise to so strong a demand as to tax
severely the resources of nurseries for a long series of years,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.314

and have an immense influence for good upon a great industry.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.315

They had another effect in their relation to the garden,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.316

and that was to quicken an interest in rare and beautiful plants from
other parts of the world, by showing that there were subjects other than
timber trees and the common laurel suitable for furnishing the garden.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.317

In the case of <font> Lilium auratum <$$font> there was a brisk demand
for bulbs at a comparatively high rate, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.318

and when it became possible to supply them at a price which placed
them within the reach of practically all owners of gardens, the demand
increased to an enormous extent.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.319

For forty years or more the importations of the bulbs of this Lily
have annually been on such a large scale as to represent a trade of
considerable importance and to occupy a prominent position in the
business of those who are concerned with the distribution of bulbs.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.320

<font> Lilium longiflorum <$$font>, which was introduced to this country
in the year previous to John Gould Veitch's voyage to Japan, has enjoyed
a higher degree of popularity than even that of <font> L. auratum
<$$font>, not because of its flowers being superior in beauty, but because
of their adaptability for decorative purposes.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.321

To the florists they are of immense value, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.322

for they can be used more or less successfully in wellnigh all forms of
the decorative art, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.323

and with the aid of the refrigerator in retarding the bulbs they can be
had in abundance at all seasons of the year.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.324

British cultivators are no longer wholly dependent upon Japanese growers
for their supplies of bulbs, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.325

but they annually obtain large importations from them.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.326

The demand for this beautiful and useful Lily is very great,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.327

and the importation and distribution of the immense numbers of bulbs
that are annually required in market-growing establishments and private
gardens has become so important a detail of commercial horticulture that
one could wish statistics showing the exact quantities that annually
reach this country from Japan were available.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.328

<font> Lilium speciosum <$$font>, which also forms an important part of
the trade in Lily bulbs with Japan, was introduced from that country in
1833; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.329

but since that year the Japanese growers of Lilies have sent us
varieties of this species which are so superior in the size, form, and
colouring of their flowers as to surpass those of the typical white
and coloured forms and to render them of quite secondary importance.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.330

Of much interest is <font> Iris Kaempferi <$$font>, which was introduced
to this country from Japan in 1857, and attracted much attention when
the large handsome and richly coloured flowers were first presented to
public notice at the exhibitions, and began to make their appearance
here and there in private gardens.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.331

For a time they failed to make the headway that was anticipated,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.332

and this was in a large measure due to the cultural details being then
imperfectly understood.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,15.333

Many of those who planted this Iris in its varied forms failed to
recognize the fact that to achieve success the roots must have the run of
a rich and moist soil, an abundance <P_1,16> of moisture being especially
necessary during the season of growth.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.334

Hence large numbers were planted in beds or the mixed border, without
reference to their special requirements in the matter of food or moisture.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.335

The growth was consequently unsatisfactory, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.336

and in course of time their cultivation was greatly reduced.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.337

Within the past few years there has been a great revival in
the interest evinced in this and other of the Japanese Irises.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.338

The lessons that the Japanese growers have been able to teach us have
been taken to heart, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.339

and moist positions are selected for the moisture-loving Irises,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.340

and, if these $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be provided, care is taken
to maintain the soil in a thoroughly moist state throughout the
whole period when the plants are in an actively growing state.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.341

The influence of the Iris gardens of Japan has been felt in many gardens
of this country, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.342

and in not a few, large plantings have been made on the lake side and
along the margin of pools, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.343

and constitute delightful features.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.344

These examples are of interest as showing that if we $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} have displays of Irises equal to those which have made the
gardens of Hori-kiri famous, we can with their aid have in this country
floral pictures of wondrous beauty.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.345

Among the Japanese trees and shrubs that have been introduced but have
not as yet been planted largely, mention may be made of <font> Magnolia
hypoleuca, <$$font> which attains noble proportions, but does not
produce its handsome flowers freely until it has attained a large size;
the Japanese Horse-chestnut <paren> <font> Aesculus turbinata <$$font>
<$$paren>; the elegant <font> Styrax japonicum <$$font>; <font> Betula
Maximowiczi <$$font>, a handsome Beech remarkable for its large leaves and
yellow bark; <font> Quercus acuta, Q. glabra latifolia <$$font>,
two Evergreen Oaks of merit.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.346

Then there is <font> Daphniphyllum glaucescens <$$font>, one of the most
handsome of evergreen shrubs, and <font> Vitis Thunbergi <$$font> , which
surpasses in brilliancy of colouring <font> V. Coignetioe <$$font>,
long so popular for clothing trellises, wall spaces, and tall pillars.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.347

With a fuller knowledge of the distinctive characteristics of the many
beautiful trees, shrubs, &c., that had been introduced from Japan,
and the increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the various
phases of garden design that had long found favour in that country ,
it is not surprising that a strong desire should have been felt by many
owners of gardens within the British Isles to create gardens more or
less in accordance with Japanese ideas.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.348

Practical expression has in numerous instances been given to this
desire, and, as might have been expected, with varying results.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.349

Where the principles governing the making of gardens on the lines followed
by the Japanese landscape gardeners have been acted upon as closely as
circumstances would permit, the result has been a distinct , interesting,
and pleasing addition to the pleasure grounds.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.350

On the other hand, where but scant attention was given to principles, the
results have not been altogether satisfactory.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.351

The Japanese garden, as we understand the term, is not a swamp, as
suggested by some of the gardens that have come under our notice.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,16.352

Neither is it a lake surrounded by an irregular belt of trees and shrubs
<P_1,17> and a winding walk, with, it may be, a bridge or stepping stones
to cross it at the narrowest part.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.353

The Japanese garden does not consist of one or two features, but of many,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.354

and one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Japanese landscape
gardener is the skill with which he combines the features of, it may
be, a whole countryside, in an area of quite moderate dimensions.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.355

Another attribute of his skill is the success that is achieved in
maintaining the relative proportions of the several features, and
also of the trees and shrubs with which the garden is embellished.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.356

In accomplishing this important object he has in many instances to use
trees, ornaments, &c., of so small a size as to suggest to the
Western mind that the garden is intended as a model on a reduced scale
rather than for the enjoyment of the owner.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.357

The garden in Japan is regarded from a somewhat different standpoint
from that which we consider it in this country.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.358

Here, to state the case generally, we provide a garden adapted
to the requirements of the plants in which the owner is specially
interested, with such embellishments as may be considered necessary;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.359

to the Japanese, plants primarily exist for the assistance they are able
to render in the production of artistic effects, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.360

and are utilized accordingly.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.361

One of the principal rules governing the work of the landscape gardener
in Japan is to follow nature as far as is practicable, and to arrange the
arborescent and other forms of plant life in their natural associations.
That is to say, plants which in a state of nature have their home on the
mountain side are not to be brought down to those parts of the garden
which represent the lowlands, and, it may be, used in the formation of a
flowery fringe to running stream or silent pool.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.362

In like manner the plants that luxuriate in the moist conditions that
obtain at the lakeside are not used in the clothing of the side of a
hill or mimic mountain.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.363

The Japanese garden artist would appear to give ready adherence to this
rule, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.364

for he can readily include in any given design the characteristic features
of any given portion of the native landscape.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.365

Another rule of some importance is to avoid as far as practicable the
planting of deciduous trees, with a few exceptions, in the more prominent
positions of the garden.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.366

The exceptions are deciduous trees remarkable for the beauty of their
flowers, such as the Cherries and Plums, which are not only immensely
attractive when yielding their wealth of flowers, but are great favourites
with the Japanese.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.367

If it is intended to plant a tree near the end of a bridge, one should
be selected which will spread its branches over it, and cast a shadow
on the water.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.368

It is not considered in accordance with the canons of garden-making
to show the whole of the volume of water tumbling over rocks,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.369

and therefore it is enjoined that in selecting a tree for planting
alongside a cascade that it will throw its branches partly over the
rushing water.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.370

Shade-giving trees are considered the most suitable for planting near
seats and tea houses, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.371

and Pines are the most generally selected for the purpose.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,17.372

Much the same rule applies to the planting of trees by the <P_1,18>
side of ponds and other small water areas, the object being to obtain
a cool retreat during the summer's heat.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.373

The selection of positions for trees in the gardens is considered
by the Japanese authorities as a matter of much importance,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.374

and they feel, as do those in this country who have had experience in
such work, that when trees are planted without the exercise of sufficient
judgment the desired effect is lost.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.375

For a long period Pines were the favourite garden trees,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.376

and they were trained to form round heads or to some quaint shape to
give a distinctive appearance to the spot in which they were placed.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.377

Of late years Western ideas would appear to have had some influence upon
the Japanese, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.378

for within the past decade or so trees more or less natural in growth
have come into favour, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.379

and the trees with formal heads or contorted branches are no longer
fashionable.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.380

The Japanese Maples, of which there are now so many beautiful forms
in cultivation, are not always a complete success in British gardens,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.381

and this is due in many instances to a failure to plant them in positions
most favourable to their full development.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.382

The Japanese, having a full knowledge of the elegance that characterises
the habit of these trees when growing under natural conditions, and
abundant opportunities for enjoying the glorious colour effects produced
by their leaves when the breath of autumn has passed over them, freely
use them in the creation of garden scenery.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.383

They by no means limit their selection to the kinds that do not take
on their rich colouring until the summer months have run their course,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.384

but group with freedom the many fine forms of <font> Acer palmatum
<$$font> that in the diversity in the form and colour of their leaves
afford a rare opportunity for the garden artist to produce colour
effects of the most beautiful description, extending from within
a short time of the bursting of the buds to the fall of the leaf.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.385

These Maples are of much value in gardens, whatever may be their design,
and particularly in those of small size; WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.386

and although the demand for them continues to be great, there is
room for an acceleration in the rate at which they are being planted.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.387

The free use of stone in the making of Japanese gardens is a point of
much interest, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.388

and while it may not be regarded as of so much importance as the trees
with which the garden is furnished, sufficient care and attention are
bestowed upon its selection to ensure every piece being suited to the
position in which it is to be placed.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.389

Especially noteworthy, also, are the stone ornaments, of which the
lanterns of stone are the most important.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.390

These lanterns may be of granite, sandstone, or limestone,
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.391

and they take us far back into the distant past.  WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.392

For many centuries they were exclusively associated with the
temples that have a prominent place in many parts of the country;
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.393

but in the course of the development of the landscape art some of the
leading exponents conceived the idea of using them in the adornment of
the garden, WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.394

and within a comparatively short period their use became general.
WEATHERS-1913-1,1,18.395
