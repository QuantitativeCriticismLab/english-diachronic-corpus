Well, the world has not come to an end yet - quite -
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.3

but if there were to be no more summer than we have had this year,
it would be nearly the same thing.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.4

Up in good time, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.5

reading life of Emperor Gratian at coffee, and seeing my way into much

Bad cold on me, since Monday; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.11

very sleepless last night, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1012.12

$Yesterday a quite successful day, though with bad cold;

To-day, a quite fearful storm of our worst sort, disturbing me from work,

RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.25

The difference between a sweet sunrise over the Norwood hills, as I used

the leafage to and fro, and taking every hue of life out of grass, water,

never got out.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.58

To-day the same, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.59

and I terribly languid.  But better so than in that dangerous excitement
which came on me in October, I hope for the last time, since I shall

RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.64

Up on the moor, $yesterday, above the farm, it felt stifling and cold
at the same time.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.65

Candles and fire the only comforts.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.66

The flowers coming out - polyanthus, primrose and at the harbour snowdrop

$Yesterday a little better; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.70

to-day, calm and seemingly meaning to clear, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1013.71

but the morning sky beginning to be fouled, as I write, by the

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know when - or if I ever - have felt so utterly
listless and powerless as all $yesterday $afternoon, in rowing through
mist across lake, and walking sadly by the stream under the rocks which
I saw to be lovely, without a ray of pleasure.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.77

The perpetual absence of sunshine has a quite deadly effect on me,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.78

but I never felt so empty of resolution or care - RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.79

the last word I mean in the mixed sense of affection and attention.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.80

Calais.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.90

Left Herne Hill station at 10.10: after walking down there first to
settle Mr. R. Weldene's business.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.91

By Chatham and Dover line through Kent, looking entirely lovely with
perpetual corn and copse.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.92

Crossed in breezy light scud of shower and sunshine;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.93

but the day was wretched in its beginning and ending, with utterly cold
wind and black sky.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.94

I never saw Calais so dismal; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.95

but, also, its life has been utterly sucked out of it by the railway,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.96

and every shop seems failing, every house becoming ruinous.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.97

The war also has first torn down half the suburbs to build barracks,
and then left the barracks tenantless!  having taxed the town half of
what it was worth to build them.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.98

We got on board steamer soon after 12, and into mouth of Calais harbour
at 2.10, just four hours from Herne Hill.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.99

Collingwood and I walked to Ho`tel Dessein RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.100

and afterwards explored town and church, finding little enough, chiefly
because of dark cold day.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.101

Dined at 1$$2 past seven.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.102

The dinner, by the old chef of old Dessein, really was worth stopping
the day for.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.103

Sketched tracery of Ho`tel de Ville - <font> once <$$font> more, as

and have only this moment found the law of it, Fig. 2, describing

$Yesterday, very sad in the morning at Calais, feeling able for nothing
, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1014.109

and the place too miserable <P_3,1015> to be seen without bitterest pity.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.110

To-day, all beautiful round me, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.111

and I feeling as able for my work as ever!  except for sight focus.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.112

The boat train, which should have started from the pier at 2.15, did
not finally leave the main station till 3.25, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.113

and we were an hour late everywhere RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.114

and only got here in the dark.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.115

Out at 1$$2 past seven RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.116

and walked till 1$$2 past 10; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.117

breakfast at 11.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.118

Got to work on cathedral front at 1.15 RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.119

The entire day was lovely, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.124

and after drawing as long as I could and drinking a glass of Co`te Ro`tie,
I walked again round the southern valley hollow, to the west end of the
ridge, where hay fields and pear orchards descend to the most beautiful
and richly wooded part of the surrounding plain.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.125

Dined at 1$$2 past seven RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.126

and to bed early.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.127

Starlight evening, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.128

but the morning grim with mist and thunder, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.129

and to-day has been dull, ending in rain now.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.130

At cathedral service among mixed society - RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.131

music and, I thought, marriage couples, two, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.132

Fe`te de l'Assomption.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.137

Yesterday here from Laon, after finishing sketch fairly well.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.138

Here, nothing but disgusts and disappointments, even to 13th $century
windows of cathedral, which are entirely grotesque and frightful in
design, though glorious in colour.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.139

And the shafts and vaultings are the worst I ever saw of the time; the
arches of nave meagre and springless; the apse only three sided instead
of five; and its double buttresses instead of single arch a mass of
weakness and confusion.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.140

The towers more and more are like confectioners'Gothic to me;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.141

nor have I ever seen so large a building look so small at the ends
of streets.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.142

Reims.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.145

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} find ugly words enough to describe the
building now set on the north side of the west end of $cathedral,
a narrow street between.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.146

It is a sort of pale faced Newgate or penitentiary with square windows
iron-grilled in a vile thin way in second storey, and as fig. 5
on the ground one.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.147

The barren, bleak, Roman-cemented stupidity of soul and sense
that it speaks for, set against the old work, kill the old also,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.148

and show all its contrasted follies.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.149

What over-richness and vain labour are in it shown more violently
by the blankness and brutal inertia of the neighbour building.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.150

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} do the iron gratings ugly enough.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.151

It <font> is <$$font> the prison!  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1015.152

<P_3,1016>

Prison side by side with Cathedral: RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.154

so our Penitentiary opposite Lambeth.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.155

The shops full of blasphemy, supplying the prison with its daily
congregation.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.156

The Preachers!  lifting up their voice in the synagogues and at the
corners of the streets.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.157

The church of Notredame at Cha`lons is one of the most perfect examples
of pure early vaulting I have ever seen.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.161

It has a 12th $century Door of fine quality, towers with new, but good,
spires.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.162

The Cathedral is nothing: RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.163

at least I have already forgotten it in the extreme interest of St.
Urbain here.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.164

Note also the church of the Madeleine for a quite defaced Norman door
of grandest school, approaching Italian, but with the English dog tooth
on its inner order moulding; and the basic colonnade of the north porch
of the Cathedral here, fearfully defaced but exquisite in earliest and
delicatest naturalism of geranium and vine.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.165

and had lovely climb of chalk hills, among sweet marjoram and the vines.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.170

No use recording the difficulties of getting across railway, nor any
of the melancholy thoughts in the corridors of the Ho`tel de l'E`cu.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.171

The balcony of the old large room is seen through my window on the left,
now open in a warm, heavily grey morning.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.172

The Seine divinely beautiful here.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.173

I have never enough thought out that Turner's work was the'Rivers'of
France, not the'towns'of it.  How he was the first painting living
creature who saw the beauty of a'coteau'.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.174

The glorious lines of the ascending vineyards to be sketched
this morning, if possible, and the statues of porch deciphered.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.175

They are the finest I hitherto know, north of Alps.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.176

Only the sketch of chalk caves was done and nothing deciphered.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1016.177

The day, thundrous and oppressive, ended in swift sheet lightning as we
ran into Avallon, with the swiftest chatterer of a woman that <P_3,1017>
$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} often heard sitting with her back to me, talking to

and got out directly after coffee this morning to see Avallon.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.180

but am now sitting at the open window in a sweet French evening.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.186

The most marvellous light of sunset has just faded off the opposite
houses, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.187

and I had a precious walk down the valley of the Cousin, which is
altogether lovely and like Dovedale and the Meuse, and the glens
of Fribourg, in all that each has of best; and like Chamouni in
granite cleavage; and like - itself in sweet French looks and ways.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.188

I woke at 3, after a long dream of vast building going on, on which we
could not get the scaffoldings level.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.196

Much of confused, more or less grand, always vexing, immemorable existence
in the night hours.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1017.197

$Yesterday to Ve`zelay.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.219

More disappointed than ever with anything; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.220

but the interior is still typical Romanesque in the nave, and
extremely pure and melodious early English, or French, in apse.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.221

Note generally that the early churches have only three lights round
apse; and that no interior can be perfect with less than five.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.222

I do not know if there are good examples of seven.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.223

The mimicked'last judgment'over central door - M. $Viollet le

the ugliest and most chaotically barren I ever saw in an old building.

Walked, having nothing better to do, to $Sauvigny-le-Blanc
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1018.231

But woke at 3 with stomach disturbance, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.278

and sleeping again towards 5, dreamed of my special Valley of Chamouni
with the steeper sides, and of being with my mother at Geneva in a new

best, and there was a great deal of company, and I was making much of
my mother and myself.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.279

Very hot walking home RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1019.292

$Yesterday after the most frightful fight I ever had with wind and sun -

the sweetest ever made by heaven.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.302

The Cyclopean walls, of blocks seven and eight feet long, and three feet
thick, the largest, all averaging two and a half cube, at a guess, laid
with their smooth cleavages to the outside, fitted like mosaic; the chinks

$Yesterday a tormented broken day, stopping at Semur, where the horribly
vulgar Gothic of church - Swiss brutality of late 13th century - disgusted
me for the day.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.314

I had bad, fidgetty, feverish tiredness on me as we came down on the
valley of nightingales, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.315

and now am discomfited after restless, silent night, since two - full
of sorrowful thought.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.316

It is clearing now after rain all night, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.317

and I hope for Citeaux.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.318

Note at Semur that the jambs of the western porches are wrought
with rich though flat panelling of the time of north door of Rouen,
very good, and the arch traceries at the sides have been full of grand
sculpture of the same kind, all deliberately chiselled away, not merely
broken , at Revolution: yet the chiselling so careless and incomplete
as to leave the subjects still traceable in outline, often beautiful.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1020.319

poor Lady Trevelyan - about five o'clock in a perfect afternoon;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.328

Then at the station, a little walk on the mountain ground among the
Euphrasy; a cup of coffee with Swiss milk; and a star lesson from
Collie as Arcturus shone out to the north and Vega at the zenith.

All remnant {COM:sic} of cha`teau now destroyed, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.334

but the little level garden on the exact summit of the hill must have
been always grass or garden, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.335

and the childhood have had always that panorama under its eyes.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.336

Now all that is near is vineyard, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.337

Mont Blanc to the hills of Eastern Burgundy and the plain, limitless
north and south.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.340

The little hill a limestone outlier, about a hundred and fifty feet

the Alps, when the clouds lift, within two minutes'walk, under command
from Moleson to the Chartreuse.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.346

It seemed to me, during a somewhat restless and sad interval of the night,
as if my life, with its work and failing, were all looped and gathered in
between St. Cergues farewell to Mont Blanc in 1845 and St.
Cergues return in 1882.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1021.347

lake wholly concealed by what seemed a mass of London smoke, silvered
at the top only.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.370

Plague wind below the turn of the valley, sharp from the south, and cold.

Walked back with many wondering thoughts, feeling also my head heavy, and
definitely the sense of what is always indefinitely {COM:"in"_in_italics}

quite inexplicable.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.372

The sky and air exactly like Sheffield, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.379

but wind quiet for the last hour after blowing like wildcats and witches
all day $yesterday.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.380

Bitter cold, with hot sun as we climbed the Do`le, only to see from
it the entire chain of Alps smothered entirely down and snuffed out by
one mass of foul, brown gray, natural - or supernatural - smoke of the
Devil's best patent make, reaching nearly across the lake so that we
could not see Geneva, much less the Sale`ve.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.381

But the sky above us all clear, and fairly healthy in colour, and
the view over lower Jura towards France very grand in misty sun,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.382

but wind so bitter that I could not examine anything right or left of
Jura, where I most wanted.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.383

The south western chain to the fort l'E`cluse entirely puzzled and upset
my notions of it, I never having allowed for the vast longitudinal valley,
which the road to the Col de la Faucille is terraced above - the valley
of the Valserine.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.384

We came down from the Do`le a little below, eastward of the
little col which separates this valley from that of Les Rousses.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1022.385

We walked up the carriage road to it, I asking an old woman staggering
slowly up under a sack whether the Cafe` of'Tabajo', our rendezvous,

broad following classes: 1.  Psalms of statement of moral principle.  2.
Psalms of praise.  <P_3,1024> 3.  Psalms of thanksgiving.  4.  Psalms of
lament.  5.  Psalms of prayer.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.419

Up at 1$$2 past five, when the Mont Blanc was nearly clear, the top quite,
but dome under mist; the Mont $Blanc de St. Gervais entirely,
and the aiguilles Plan and Midi all dark against light pure cirri above
sunrise.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.422

In a quarter of an hour, the plague cloud formed, from the west, coming
from Mont Joli, brown, and in heavy flakes, covering all as low as the
base of the $aiguille de Bionassay.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.423

By 1$$2 past six one could only see a black point or two of aiguilles;
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.424

the valley was half filled with cloud, thin and streaky but dirty, and
all in a state of flux, flight, change and diseased motion and make.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1024.425

Now, seven, all the sky is covered, the sun which shone for about ten

There is a lovely boulder in the bed of a rivulet, to be found by the

drew in peace at duomo front in quiet air, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.630

the chestnuts, and so up to the terraced fields.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.631

Saw the glittering sea and Gorgona RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1030.632

classic hills, plumed and downy with wood, the burning russet of fallen

Rain came on just as I had got to work RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.830

and poured all day, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.831

and quite unexpected company in the evening put me out.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.832

But $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} slept fairly well, waked near 5 by crashing rain,
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.833

and all is now cloudy and dismal, plague blackness driving from the west.

Up in good heart, after a little stomach attack which kept me waking,
but left me clear-headed enough to get plans into shape, of which
the principal is the settlement opposite of days for address.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.838

$Yesterday worked hard against wind and rain, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.839

but had lovely walk under and opposite the monastery, among nice
chestnut gatherers in Greek draperies, and arbutus bushes like
fruits of Paradise, myrtle berries for blaeberries, and acorned ilex.

and for the first time, seven o'clock too early for light.
RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.846

$Yesterday worked very hard on pillar RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.847

and had nice little chat with two <font> contadine <$$font>, explaining
my drawing and the cathedral front to them.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.848

One, presently <paren> middle aged unfortunately, or more than middle
<$$paren> had her arm round my neck in her eagerness to know if I was
going to draw the entire front.  RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1035.849

finished, virtually, duomo drawing rightly, RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.873

and went for $afternoon walk up the Monte Pisano again to the very top,

came down full pace as in old times; RUSKIN-1882-2,3,1036.876

ended with celestial walk in moonlight on the winding marble road.
