Of chronic rheumatism.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,1.3

<$$heading>

This is, perhaps, one of the most common of the many lingering and
painful maladies that afflict mankind.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,1.5

It is a disease to which the poor and labouring classes are peculiarly
subject, BARDSLEY-1807-1,1.6

but the extent of its ravages is best ascertained by the medical
attendants on large Hospitals.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,1.7

Chronic rheumatism, and its varieties, form a large proportion of
the medical cases which are admitted into the Manchester Infirmary;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,1.8

and it may be readily conceived that such cases are both numerous and
severe, when $it {TEXT:i} is known, that the occupation of weaving is
carried on, not unfrequently by preference, and sometimes from necessity ,
in damp and confined cellars within the town; and that the surrounding
country abounds with colliers, bleachers, dyers, and other artisans,
who are necessarily exposed to sudden and great changes of temperature.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,1.9

But if the poor and industrious classes of society in this neighbourhood
are more than <P_2> commonly exposed to chronic rheumatism, they and
their medical advisers have the consolation to find, that in the general
Infirmary of the district, particular attention has been paid to furnish
every means for the comfort and relief of this description of patients.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,2.10

The institution of vapor and warm baths, both for general and local
purposes, an electrical and galvanic apparatus, and the convenience of
small, comfortable and distinct wards, are demonstrative proofs of the
attention paid to the rheumatic class of patients.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,2.11

Under such favorable circumstances, I entered upon the task of treating
the most inveterate cases of chronic rheumatism with every reasonable
prospect of success.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,2.12

At all events, an excellent opportunity was afforded of ascertaining the
real nature of many remedies, which have been considered as efficacious
in the cure, or relief, of this disorder.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,2.13

It would be trifling and useless to enter into any detail of the
generality of the cases which have been submitted to my care.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,2.14

Indeed, the history of chronic rheumatism and its treatment, are both
too well known to afford an expectation of the discovery of much novelty
either of principles or facts; BARDSLEY-1807-1,2.15

but still I am of opinion, that the communication of the <P_3> general
result of the treatment <paren> under circumstances favorable both for
practice and accurate observation <$$paren> of a large number of cases ,
will be likely to prove useful, by establishing on a firmer basis, some
of the various modes which have been generally recommended for the cure
of this disease.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,3.16

It will be proper to premise, that I mean to include under the term
chronic rheumatism, such painful affections of the muscular fibres,
membranes, and joints as are unattended with fever, specific virus,
or peculiar derangement of the stomach and bowels; and which are seldom
accompanied with external tumor or inflammation, but are very liable to
shift suddenly from one part to another, and are readily propagated along
the course of the membranes and muscular fibres.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,3.17

This definition will include chronic <font> lumbago, sciatica, <$$font>
and what has been considered a distinct disease, - <font> nodosity
<$$font> of the joints.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,3.18

No doubt the violence and inveteracy of chronic rheumatism are modified by
the peculiar structure of the part which it affects.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,3.19

When the large joints with their ligaments, such as the hip joint, and
lumbar <font> vertebrae <$$font> become affected, the contiguous nerves
often suffer from the same cause, BARDSLEY-1807-1,3.20

and a long train <P_4> of aggravated symptoms arise, which are with
great difficulty subdued.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.21

The practice therefore must be regulated according to these varying
circumstances; BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.22

but I think myself intitled to assert, from a large induction of facts,
that the <font> rationale <$$font> of the practice in the cure of
every species of chronic rheumatism, is in general simple and uniform.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.23

It consists in removing passive inflammation, and restoring the
debilitated vessels and muscular fibres to their due tone and action.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.24

These ends are chiefly to be accomplished by topical applications
, although internal remedies are by no means to be neglected.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.25

I find from an inspection of my medical-case book, that two hundred and
sixty-nine persons <paren> exclusively of a considerable number which
were of a mixed and doubtful nature <$$paren> labouring under severe
chronic rheumatism, have been admitted under my care as in-patients of
the Infirmary.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.26

The majority of these cases were of long standing, BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.27

and had been brought from distant parts of the country to the
Infirmary, as the last resource, after the usual means had failed.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,4.28

I shall now proceed to offer some general <P_5> practical remarks on
the effects of those remedies which appear to be most efficacious in
the cure or relief of chronic rheumatism under its different forms; and
at the same time, report a few cases to illustrate the effects of these
anti-rheumatic medicines, which have not been generally introduced into
practice; BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.29

and, in order to bring the general result into one view, I shall furnish
tables from which some useful practical conclusions may be drawn.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.30

<heading>

<font> Warm, and Vapor Baths.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.32

<$$heading>

The general recommendation of the warm bath, to excite sweating, in most
instances of chronic rheumatism, led me to expect great advantage from
its use.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.34

Experience, however, has corrected my too sanguine expectation.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.35

When the disease had raged for a length of time, and induced both
local and general debility, or when protracted deep-seated pains had
infested the larger joints, as in <font> sciatica <$$font> and <font>
lumbago, <$$font> I have found much harm to result from the warm bath.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.36

Sweating indeed, in such cases, relieved for the moment,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.37

but it subsequently aggravated the local as well as general $symptoms
{TEXT:symptons}.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,5.38

When the pains were of more recent date, <P_6> chiefly attacked the
muscles and their membranous coverings, occasionally shifting from
one part to another, and the strength was at the same time but little
reduced, then a moderate use of the warm bath proved highly serviceable.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,6.39

If this remedy however, failed to produce good effects, after one or two
trials it was laid aside, as its continuance under such circumstances,
uniformly tended to protract the patient's recovery.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,6.40

By the term <font> warm-bath, <$$font> I allude to water heated to an
hundred degrees and upwards.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,6.41

But a <font> tepid <$$font> bath, from eighty-four to ninety, I have
found an useful auxiliary in soothing pain, relaxing the stiffened
joints and rigid fibres; especially in elderly patients, whose strength
had been greatly reduced by the length and violence of the disorder.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,6.42

Still I consider both the warm and tepid bath as remedies of inferior
value, when compared with the topical and sometimes general use of hot
water in the form of <font> vapor.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,6.43

Whenever the joints were found so rigid as to be nearly immoveable, and
the pain upon motion exquisitely severe, or when the muscles had become
contracted and almost paralytic; and indeed, in every protracted case of
the disease of the hip-joint, <font> lumbago, <$$font> or <font> sciatica,
<$$font> the vapor of <P_7> hot water, locally and properly applied,
afforded <paren> especially in conjunction with other topical applications
<$$paren> a safe, and often successful remedy.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.44

The mode of applying it must be regulated according to circumstances.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.45

Our apparatus consists of a boiler, from which steam is conveyed
through pipes, that $are {TEXT:arc} so constructed, as to admit of being
conveniently applied to different parts of the body.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.46

In all obstinate affections of the joints, a pipe of nearly half-inch
diameter is to be preferred, BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.47

and a quarter of an hour is the shortest period for its application.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.48

It is better, as a general rule, to commence with a pipe of smaller
size, and only to permit the vapor to strike upon the affected part,
at some distance from its aperture.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.49

By these means an inconvenience will be avoided, which has sometimes
prevented the steady application of the remedy; viz. too great
irritation of the skin from an excess of heat.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.50

By degrees, the parts will be enabled to bear a considerable column
of vapor, at a very small distance from the extremity of the pipe;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.51

and thus the remedy will be most likely to produce its full effect.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,7.52

I have entered into these particulars, concerning the local application
of this remedy, from a conviction, that its advantages are not generally
<P_8> nor sufficiently appreciated.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.53

At the same time I must observe, that it was found to act only as a
powerful auxiliary.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.54

For I have in vain attempted to disperse some obstinate rheumatic
affections, by relying solely on its use.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.55

My experience of the effects of the <font> general <$$font> vapor-bath
is but limited.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.56

There have been but few cases in which I have deemed it prudent to
excite the violent degree of sweating, that is the consequence of this
application.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.57

But whenever it was thought necessary to produce such an effect, I found
it the most certain and efficacious means that could be employed for
the purpose.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.58

<heading>

<font> Electricity, and Galvanism.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.60

<$$heading>

The former of these powerful agents I have long been in the habit
of employing, as a remedy in obstinate rheumatic complaints.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.62

When the disease more particularly affected the muscular fibres, and
was attended with torpor, rigidity, and diminution of vital heat, the
application of electricity, by sparks or shocks, was often attended with
manifest advantage; BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.63

but it was in conjunction with the topical applications of vapour
that its effects were more powerfully and beneficially exerted.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,8.64

The plan which I have generally pursued, is, <P_9> first to order
the diseased parts to be exposed to the action of vapor; and,
during this operation, a stimulant liniment to be diligently rubbed
upon their surface; and finally, the application of electricity.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,9.65

The operation of drawing sparks, more or less powerful, according to the
state of the disease, is, in general, to be preferred to the administering
of shocks.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,9.66

I have seen some cases of purely chronic rheumatism of several years
standing, where the patients were so helpless as to be brought in a
litter to the Infirmary, completely recovered by the steady, diligent,
and conjoined use of these remedies, along with tonics and anodynes.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,9.67

It may not be improper to state, as a caution, that the parts which
have undergone the above-mentioned operations, ought to be carefully
enveloped in flannel; BARDSLEY-1807-1,9.68

and indeed, such a covering should be constantly worn, where the <font>
natural heat <$$font> is any way deficient: BARDSLEY-1807-1,9.69

I mention this latter circumstance, because I have seen instances <paren>
especially in young subjects <$$paren> where flannel or other warm
covering aggravated the patients'sufferings, by increasing the degree
of heat, when it was already too abundant.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,9.70

But such an excess of local temperament does not often occur in <P_10>
chronic rheumatism, BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.71

and is generally of short duration.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.72

My experience of galvanism in this disease, is at present rather confined.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.73

I have applied this remedy in some cases with advantage.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.74

But I have not been able to succeed in any instance where electricity
, and other powerful remedies have intirely {COM:sic_here_and_passim}
failed.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.75

It seems to be chiefly indicated, where the nervous energy, as well
as muscular activity and vigor, is much enfeebled by $long-continued
{TEXT:long_continued} pain and in-action {COM:sic}.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.76

In two cases of this kind, I found galvanism of great service; but
not more so than what might have been expected from the application
of electricity.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.77

<heading>

<font> Topical Bleeding, and Issues.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.79

<$$heading>

These remedies are of essential benefit in the relief and cure of some
of the most painful and harrassing species of rheumatic affections.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,10.81

Indeed, where the ligaments and membranes of the joints are the peculiar
seat of the disease, or an enlargement of the extremities of the bones has
taken place, the first attempt at relief, especially in young and vigorous
subjects, should be directed to local bleeding; either by leeches, or
what is to be preferred, the operation of cupping and <P_11> scarifying.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.82

When the pain and irritation are abated by <font> repeated bleeding,
<$$font> no time should be lost in securing a drain from the part by
the aid of issues.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.83

I am enabled from numerous comparative trials, to recommend the
application of a caustic in preference to the knife, for the purpose of
establishing an effectual drain.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.84

The <font> kali purum <$$font> answers the purpose better than any other
caustic which I have tried.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.85

I have seen several hip-cases, of long standing, yield to the persevering
use of these means; BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.86

but it was often necessary, in order to remove the rigidity and want of
tone in the parts which remained, after the subsidence of the more violent
symptoms, to have recourse to the combined aid of vapor and electricity,
{COM:sic} BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.87

In very obstinate cases of <font> sciatica, <$$font> which resisted all
other means of relief, I have witnessed the happiest effects from issues;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.88

but then it must be observed, that it was often necessary to surround
the joint with several of these drains, BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.89

and the degree of irritation and discharge, was moderated or increased
, according to the obstinacy of the disease, and the strength of the
patient.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.90

I have seen in a hip-joint case, three of these artificial openings
succeed, when two have failed.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,11.91

I am completely satisfied, that want of success in <P_12> the cure of many
of these $long-protracted {TEXT:long_protracted} cases, is owing to the
neglect of a vigorous and persevering use of the means above recommended.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.92

For they have succeeded under the steady discipline of <font> Hospital
practice, <$$font> after their former failure under a feeble and desultory
mode of application in private.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.93

<heading>

<font> Blisters, and Rubefacients.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.95

<$$heading>

When the pains affected only the <font> fascia <$$font> and superficial
fibres of the muscles, great relief was obtained by covering the affected
parts with a blister; BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.97

but it was frequently found more beneficial to use this remedy at a
distance from the seat of the disease.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.98

Thus, in some recent and slight cases of <font> sciatica, <$$font>
a blister proved speedily and certainly useful, when applied to the
inferior extremity of the thigh bone.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.99

Indeed, whenever the complaint seized upon any of the larger and
$deep-seated {TEXT:deep_seated} muscles, at their origin near the
joint, the mode of applying blisters to the inferior extremities of
such muscles , and near to the points of their insertion, was found to
be highly beneficial.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,12.100

In every obstinate case of chronic rheumatism, where from the nature
and situation of the diseased part, issues could not with safety or
convenience be applied, recourse was always <P_13> had to blisters as
a substitute.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.101

But experience has taught me never to rely upon blisters, in several
cases of a local nature, when the aid of issues can be obtained.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.102

With respect to their mode of application, I have found a repetition
of fresh blisters to be preferable, as producing less distress to
the patient, and greater effects upon the disease, to the practice
of keeping up a constant sore by stimulating the vesicated parts with
blistering ointment.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.103

The utility of rubefacients in relieving pain, and entirely removing
slight instances of chronic rheumatism, was often experienced.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.104

They may be employed, according to circumstances, either in the form of
liniment or plaster.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.105

When the pains were local and permanent, but not very severe, great
advantage resulted from stimulating the skin and supporting the heat of
the part by the aid of warm plasters.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.106

The following composition proved of excellent use in that most tedious
kind of chronic rheumatism, which often attacks young females soon after
the age of puberty; and is attended for the most part with stiffness
and swelling of the ancle {COM:sic_here_and_passim} and knee joints.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,13.107

Indeed, wherever the disease had left a thickening and almost indurated
state of the integuments, as well as rigidity of the tendons and ligaments
<P_14> of the joints, the local stimulus of this application was attended
with good effect.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,14.108

<heading>

- The addition of more or less of the muriated ammonia, must be regulated
according to the degree of irritation which it may be thought proper
to excite.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,14.113

In most cases it is better to use it sparingly at first.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,14.114

After the trial of numerous kinds of liquid rubefacients, with a view
to relieve pain, and remove the atony of the muscular fibres, which
more or less prevails in every case of chronic rheumatism, I give to
the following liniment a decided preference.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,14.115

{COM:symbol_for_recipe}: Linimenti saponis, {COM:symbol_for_ounce} ij
Aq. ammoniae, Tinct Cantharid: opii a` a` {COM:symbol_for_dram}
ij G: Camphor, {COM:symbol_for_dram} i M. ft. Linimentum.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,14.116

The liniment should be diligently rubbed upon the parts affected,
after the skin has been warmed and irritated by the friction of hot
, dry, and coarse cloths; or the application of the flesh-brush.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,14.117

<P_15>

In almost every instance where it was adviseable to employ vapor locally,
but especially in <font> sciatica <$$font> and <font> lumbago <$$font>
, I have directed this liniment to be diligently and plentifully
rubbed in upon the parts, while they were exposed to the vapor pipe.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.119

By this method its stimulating effects were heightened,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.120

pain was abated, and the cure much accelerated.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.121

<heading>

<font> Internal Remedies.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.123

<$$heading>

I must confess I have met with much disappointment in the trial of
many remedies, highly recommended by practical writers for the cure of
chronic rheumatism.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.125

There have been few examples, BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.126

but those are certainly of an important kind, where internal medicines
have singly completed the cure of very severe and obstinate cases.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.127

The internal remedies which have been most generally recommended, are
of two kinds: viz. 1.  sudorifics, 2.  medicines of a stimulating
nature, which abound in essential oils and resins.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.128

To these, mercurial preparations must be added.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.129

With respect to the use of sudorifics, I soon found that much caution
was required in their exhibition.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,15.130

In more recent attacks, where the disease was diffused over the whole
frame, and attended with violent pain and occasional <P_16> febrile
accessions, much advantage was derived by exciting moderate sweating;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.131

but if this were carried to a profuse degree, not only great debility,
but an aggravation of the pains ensued.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.132

In short, I can speak decidedly of the injurious effects of sudorifics ,
when pushed to any great extent, in every instance of severe and local
affection of the joints; and also in most other cases where the disease
has been long continued, and the patient's constitution much debilitated.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.133

In chronic <font> lumbago <$$font> and <font> sciatica, <$$font> I
have never experienced any lasting benefit to result from this mode
of practice.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.134

Small doses of antimonial powder combined with calomel and opium, were
certainly useful in allaying pain and irritation; BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.135

but their efficacy consisted rather in palliating symptoms, than curing
the disease, when of a serious and obstinate kind.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.136

The same observation will nearly apply to the use of stimulant remedies,
such as <font> resin of guaiacum, <$$font> the class of $terebinthinates
{TEXT:terebrinthinates}, and of essential oils.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,16.137

In the most aggravated instances of general chronic rheumatism, where
great torpor and debility prevailed, <font> guaiacum <$$font> in such
large doses as the stomach and bowels would bear, was found to be a
powerful auxiliary; and certainly the most generally efficacious of all
the internal <P_17> remedies that were employed.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.138

But I have seen no instance of its complete success, when unaided by
topical applications in any species of the disease where much local
injury of the joints had taken place.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.139

It acted most beneficially when exhibited in substance, well triturated
with mucilage; to which was occasionally added, <font> Gum kino,
<$$font> or <font> Tinct. opii, <$$font>, to prevent its effects
on the bowels.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.140

In many obstinate cases the ammoniated tincture of guaiacum, incorporated
with mucilage, and joined to a strong decoction of bark, proved of
great service, where the constitution was broken down by the violence
and length of the disease.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.141

There were but few protracted cases in which the Peruvian bark was
not prescribed with advantage as a tonic, especially at the close of
the disease.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.142

It was, however, never administered with any other design than as an
auxiliary.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.143

In future I shall certainly be induced to make a trial of this remedy
as a principal mean {COM:sic} of relief.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,17.144

The propriety of employing it in the cure of <font> acute <$$font>
rheumatism has been long sanctioned by the recommendation <P_18> of
Dr. G. Fordyce, Dr. Fothergill, and Sir Edward Hulse,
and lately so strongly confirmed by the extended and valuable experiments
of Dr. Haygarth, BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.145

<paren> and I would add the testimony, if it were necessary, of my own
recent experience of its superior efficacy <$$paren> that there can
be no reasonable distrust of the utility and safety of the practice.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.146

Now as there is no doubt of the affinity between the acute, and chronic
species of this disease <paren> the former frequently terminating in
the latter <$$paren> the bark would seem to be a remedy, under many
circumstances, equally suited to both.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.147

Turpentine, in every form, was an ungrateful medicine to the stomach;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.148

often impaired the appetite; BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.149

and did not produce, when even duly persisted in, such salutary effects
as the remedy before mentioned.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.150

I shall notice hereafter the use of mercury in one kind of
chronic rheumatism, or at least in a disease nearly allied to it.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.151

There is another internal remedy which has enjoyed a very high local
reputation in Lancashire; and was introduced about thirty years ago
into practice, by one of the physicians of the Manchester Infirmary.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.152

It is the <font> Oleum Jecoris aselli, <$$font> or Cod-liver oil,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,18.153

<P_19>

and was recommended to me by my late highly respected colleague and
friend Dr. Percival, as deserving a fair and extensive trial in
chronic rheumatism.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.155

It is a medicine so very nauseous both in smell and taste, that however
disguised, many delicate stomachs $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear it;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.156

yet I have known this repugnance not only overcome; BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.157

but, such is the power of habit, a relish for its high flavour succeeds
to the original disgust.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.158

From long and repeated experience, I am enabled to speak of it as a
medicine of efficacious, but limited powers.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.159

In some instances, where every other means have proved unsuccessful
, it has operated in a manner so decidedly beneficial, as to excite
astonishment.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.160

But, on the other hand, it has frequently failed in some of the mild,
and more common rheumatic affections.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,19.161

The circumstances under which I have found it most advantageous, when
used both externally and internally, are the following, 1st.  In the
chronic rheumatism of elderly persons, where the muscles and tendons
have been rigid, and the joints nearly inflexible, in consequence of
the disease <P_20> having been brought on by excessive labor, hard fare,
dampness, and cold.  2nd.  In women whose constitutions have been worn
out by repeated rheumatic attacks after parturition, and more especially
in the decline of life.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.162

I have seen a few patients recover intirely by the exhibition of the oil;
who, on their admission into the house, were unable either to preserve the
body in an erect posture, or support its weight on the lower extremities.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.163

I do not intend to enter into an explanation of the <font> modus operandi
<$$font> of this medicine in curing rheumatism.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.164

Whether it subdues the disease by exciting a specific action upon
the small obstructed vessels, or whether it serves to lubricate the
rigid fibres, by favoring the secretion of fat, I shall not pretend to
determine; BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.165

but the fact certainly is, that patients who have for some time
taken this remedy, are disposed to increase in bulk and fatness,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.166

and it scarcely ever was attended with decisive advantages
without producing these effects, in a greater or less degree.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.167

Warm table-beer is the vehicle for the oil, which the lower order of
patients most commonly prefer.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,20.168

The dose was from half an ounce, to an ounce and a half, twice or
thrice a-day {COM:sic_here_and_passim}, according to the delicacy
of the patient's stomach, and the <P_21> effects of the medicine.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.169

It is seldom uniform in its mode of operation; BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.170

sometimes it acts upon the kidneys, at others on the bowels, producing
griping and <font> diarrhoea.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.171

I have observed an eruption on the skin, preceded by prickling heat, in
many patients, after first making use of the oil; BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.172

but in a majority of cases, it produced, after a short period, none of
these sensible effects.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.173

I have never found it to excite sweating, unless when taken in bed, and
assisted by drinking plentifully of warm liquids.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.174

It was remarked that, if after about a fortnight's trial, no abatement
of the pain or rigidity ensued, it was in vain to persist solely in the
use of this remedy; BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.175

but when its beneficial influence had once commenced, so slow and gradual
was the progress of cure in many instances, that patients have continued
to receive advantage during the whole course of six or eight months trial.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.176

In serious rheumatic affections of the large joints, no great benefit
was derived from its use, unless when joined with the local application
of vapor and electricity.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,21.177

Indeed, as an internal remedy for chronic rheumatism, I consider it
inferior in many respects to gum guaiacum, although it exceeds that
and every other medicine <paren> with perhaps one exception, <P_22>
which will hereafter be noticed <$$paren> in the relief and cure of
such peculiar states of the disorder as have been just described.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.178

It is of importance to remark, that this medicine has preserved its
reputation in our Infirmary, nearly unimpaired, during the period of
thirty years; BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.179

for I find its annual consumption to have been from fifty to sixty
gallons, soon after its introduction in 1776; BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.180

and the quantity dispensed from many years back has seldom fallen below
the above amount; BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.181

the last year it exceeded forty gallons.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.182

<heading>

<font> Arsenic.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.184

<$$heading>

The good effects arising from a judicious exhibition of this active and
deleterious mineral, in several severe and obstinate diseases, have
been long well known, and duly appreciated by medical practitioners.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.186

But the introduction of arsenic for the cure of chronic rheumatism,
is comparatively of late date.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.187

An account of a successful trial of the remedy was widely dispersed,
through the medium of a periodical Medical Journal; BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.188

yet the practice seems to be nearly confined to a few members of the
profession, residing in Manchester.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,22.189

<P_23>

Mr. Jenkinson, the late ingenious house-surgeon, and apothecary to
the Infirmary, is justly entitled to the merit of having first discovered
the internal efficacy of arsenic, in the cure of a deplorable case of
chronic rheumatism, which had resisted all the usual modes of relief.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.191

Soon afterwards, Mr. Hardman, a respectable surgeon in this town ,
exhibited this remedy in what was deemed an incurable case of the same
disease, with marked and decisive advantage.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.192

Possessed of early information of these facts, and firmly relying upon
the abilities and integrity of both these gentlemen, I was desirous,
on the score of humanity, as well as oeconomy, to introduce a trial of
the practice into the Infirmary, in all such obstinate rheumatic cases
as had resisted the usual means of relief.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.193

An opportunity soon occurred for the purpose; BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.194

and the following are some of the most important cases in which the
remedy was duly administered.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.195

I have not thought it necessary to enter into all the detail of the
treatment of these patients, BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.196

and have therefore only given abstracts from the Infirmary books, and
my own private notes.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,23.197

BARDSLEY-1807-1,24.203

Four years ago he was seized with an attack of acute rheumatism, which
left him so debilitated and crippled, particularly in the joints of the
lower extremities, as to be unable ever since to follow his employment.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,24.204

He is now become a miserable spectacle.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,24.205

The knee and ancle joints are enlarged, stiff, and exquisitely painful

He is greatly emaciated, BARDSLEY-1807-1,24.207

The muscles of the legs and thighs are shrunk, flabby, and scarcely to

Blisters were ordered for each knee, BARDSLEY-1807-1,24.211

and gum guaiacum, in the decoction of bark, together with pills of calomel

but he complains of loss of appetite and want of strength,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.219

and his night sweats have become very profuse; BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.220

no sensible diminution in the swelling of the joints.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.221

The medicines to be repeated, and the affected joints to be covered with

No improvement in the local or general state of the disease having taken
place in this interval, I was induced to try the effect of arsenic.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.224

He was therefore directed to take four drops of Fowler's mineral solution
, <paren> prepared according to Duncan's Edinburgh Dispensatory,
p. 159, Ed. 183.  <$$paren> in a dose of decoction of
bark, with an equal quantity of tincture of opium, three times a day;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.225

and all local applications were ordered to be laid aside, except a simple
covering of flannel.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.226

The medicine has agreed well with the patient.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.228

his appetite is improved; BARDSLEY-1807-1,25.230

to support the weight of his body.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.235

The improvement has been rapid and decisive.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.238

The appetite and strength of the patient are much increased.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.239

He is able to walk with very little assistance; BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.240

and the lower extremity of each thigh bone <paren> which was before
protuberant <$$paren> is now nearly reduced to its proper size;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.241

but the ancles are yet stiff and weak.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.242

As the medicine sat easy upon the stomach, and had brought on no other
inconvenience than a slight degree of constipation, a gentle aperient
was ordered, and the mineral solution to be administered in future
without opium.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.243

10 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.244

The patient has been daily gaining ground.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.245

He has acquired strength and flesh; BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.246

and the local complaints are so far removed, as to admit of his
walking a considerable distance without much pain or fatigue.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.247

The enlargement of the knee and ancle joints has completely disappeared
; BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.248

and except a slight degree of local debility, chiefly in the ancles,
he might be considered as entirely cured.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,26.249

I had the satisfaction to learn from his mother, that in a fortnight from
this period, her son had returned to his employment in the cotton-mill

John Fullilove, Soldier, Aet. 31.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,27.256

<$$heading>

A home-patient, residing at No. 11, Gibralter {COM:sic}, in
Manchester, was transferred to my care, March 21, 1805, upon the change
of districts.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,27.258

He was first admitted under the preceding physician of the district, on
November 5, 1804, as a case of chronic rheumatism.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,27.259

The patient was suddenly attacked, more than two years ago, with catarrh
and acute rheumatism, in consequence of a march into Yorkshire during
a violent storm of snow.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,27.260

The complaint at length settled in the joints of the lower extremities;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,27.261

and rendered him completely a cripple.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,27.262

He was brought to Manchester, and placed under the care of a respectable
surgeon, who <paren> officiating for the surgeon of the regiment <$$paren>
attended him during <P_28> several months; BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.263

but, his complaint continuing to increase, he was made an
Infirmary-patient, and immediately put upon the plan of diaphoretics
and blisters, but without any sensible advantage.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.264

At this period <paren> March 21st.  <$$paren> the disease is chiefly
confined to the joints of the knee, ancle, and great toe of the right leg.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.265

The knee joint is much enlarged, quite rigid, and so contracted, as
to bring the patient's heel nearly into contact with the back part of
the thigh.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.266

The pain he feels upon any motion of the limb, is intolerably severe.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.267

The great toe appears much distorted, and even dislocated at the first
joint.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.268

From confinement to bed for eighteen months past, and almost constant
severe pain, night sweats, and loss of appetite, the patient's strength
and flesh are deplorably reduced.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.269

His legs and thighs have lost almost every appearance of muscular texture
, BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.270

and his countenance is truly cadaverous.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.271

I must confess that I entertained but feeble hopes of success in this
case, from any medical treatment; BARDSLEY-1807-1,28.272

but, as a last resource, I immediately put the patient upon the following
plan.  The knee joint to be enveloped in the ammoniacal epithem before
mentioned; and five drops of the arsenical solution, with an equal
quantity of tincture of opium, in spirituous cinnamon <P_29> water, to
be taken twice or thrice a-day, according to their effects; and also a
diaphoretic opiate, to produce a little respite from pain in the night.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.273

Great relief was obtained in the space of a few days, by this method.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.274

The pain became less severe, BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.275

the appetite amended, BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.276

and the patient passed more tranquil nights.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.277

<font> April <$$font> 6 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.278

I found him this day more improved than I even expected, from the
favorable reports of Mr. Thompson <paren> physician's clerk
, <$$paren> who had carefully watched the progress of the remedy.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.279

He was able to bear fifteen drops of the solution each twenty-four hours
; BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.280

and he observed with great satisfaction, that his pains were
abated, his appetite much improved, and his sweating nearly gone.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.281

He could now suffer the knee to be handled, and also some extension of
the joint.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.282

His countenance was remarkably brightened, BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.283

and he entertained sanguine hopes of obtaining a complete cure.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.284

Some slight degree of inflammation having been excited by the epithem,
it was laid aside for the present.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.285

The medicines were ordered to be continued, BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.286

and the patient enjoined the use of nourishing diet, with porter at
dinner.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,29.287

<P_30>

18 <font> th.  <font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.289

During this interval, a gradual improvement has taken place.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.290

He can now sit upon the side of the bed, and bear the extension of the
knee-joint so far, as to admit the posture of the limb to be varied.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.291

There is no external pain felt upon pressing any of the enlarged joints
; and very little disturbance from this symptom at any other time.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.292

The arsenical solution has encreased the urinary discharge; and, at the
same time, brought on some degree of <font> heat <$$font> in the <font>
fauces, <$$font> with a slight soreness of the gums, and increased flow
of <font> saliva.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.293

As these symptoms were moderate, it was thought better to restrict the
exhibition of the remedy to once a day, than to omit it altogether.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.294

From this period he gradually gained the power of locomotion,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.295

the joints became more flexible, BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.296

the pain vanished, BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.297

and the muscles of the legs and thighs acquired some degree of plumpness
and vigor.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.298

He resumed, on June the 12th, the use of the solution, in conjunction
with bark, <font> three times a-day, <$$font> without inconvenience to
his throat or gums.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.299

A perseverance in this course of medicine recovered him, so far, that
on the 20th of June, he was able, with the help of a stick, to walk to
the Infirmary, BARDSLEY-1807-1,30.300

and was entered on <P_31> the list of <font> out-patients.  <font>
BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.301

On minutely examining the diseased parts, I found the toe likely to
remain displaced, BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.302

but the joint was intirely free from pain or swelling.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.303

His right knee and ancle were reduced to their natural size;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.304

and, except a slight degree of rigidity about the tendons of the ham,
and a want of a due tone in the muscles of the leg, his recovery might
be deemed complete.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.305

He was ordered to cover the part simply with a flannel roller, and
continue his medicines; care being taken at the same time to obviate
costiveness.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.306

His visits at the Infirmary were from this time only occasionally repeated
, until the 24th of August, when he was discharged entirely cured of
his rheumatic affection, and so completely established in health and
strength, as to be enabled to resume his situation in the regiment.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.307

I had the satisfaction to learn from the patient, who called upon
me this day, September 19, 1806, that he continues free from any
return of his complaint; and is in every respect fit for active duty.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.308

From my success in the above instances, where the cartilages and heads
of the bones had become enlarged by a long continuance of the disease,
I was induced to try the effects of the mineral solution, in a severe
and marked case of nodosity of the joints.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,31.309

This patient <paren> whose case will hereafter <P_32> be noticed <$$paren>
was put upon the trial of the remedy, after other means had failed.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.310

He began with five, BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.311

and gradually increased the dose to eight drops, along with <font>
Tinct. opii <$$font> twice, and sometimes thrice, a-day.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.312

The medicine agreed well with his constitution; BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.313

and it was so administered, as to produce its full effect.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.314

He persisted in its use, under my constant inspection and a proper
regimen, for nearly three weeks, before it was thought proper to
discontinue a further trial.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.315

I have likewise ordered the solution in two other cases of mild chronic
rheumatism, where the muscles and their investing membranes were the
seat of complaint; BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.316

but my success did not equal my expectation.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.317

The recovery of both patients, who were Females, was obliged
to be expedited by calling in the aid of other remedies, as the
beneficial operation of the solution was neither speedy, nor decisive.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.318

I am therefore disposed to infer <paren> as far as my limited
experience will permit <$$paren> that it is only in the protracted
chronic rheumatism, where the vital powers are much diminished, and
the ends of the bones, periosteum, capsules or ligaments of the joints,
are likewise partially affected, that the use of arsenic is likely to
prove eminently successful.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,32.319

However, there <P_33> can be no doubt, from its indisputable efficacy
in such instances as have already been published, or the propriety of
instituting a number of comparative trials of this remedy, with others
of an approved and established kind, in the cure of every variety
of so prevalent and distressing a malady as chronic rheumatism.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,33.320

It is my intention to enter, at no distant period, upon this experimental
enquiry.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,33.321

I feel more encouraged to this undertaking, from a conviction, the
result of frequent and attentive observation, that arsenic is a safe
and harmless remedy, when <font> prudently <$$font> administered.

<font> Nodosity of the Joints.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,33.324

<$$heading>

A truly medical philosopher, Dr. Haygarth, is the first and only
writer I am acquainted with, who has given a separate and distinct view of
an affection of the joints under the above title.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,33.326

The complaint has been generally noticed as rheumatic-gout,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,33.327

and is evidently alluded to by Sauvages under this term, although his
description of the symptoms is not complete.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,33.328

I am however of opinion, that it is more nearly allied to chronic
rheumatism <P_34> than to gout.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.329

I have at this time two patients under my care, <paren> on account of
complaints of a different nature <$$paren> who have long been martyrs
to this dreadful malady.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.330

One is a gentleman aged sixty, who has been a cripple from thirty years
of age.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.331

All the affected joints are strangely distorted, BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.332

and the number of nodes <paren> which vary in size and hardness
<$$paren> occupying the upper and lower extremities, amount to nineteen.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.333

He stated the disease to have come on, in consequence of using the cold
bath, when he was much heated.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.334

The joints of the wrist, and fingers of the right hand, were first
affected, but without exciting much attention, till at length the disease
seized upon the knees, and ancles, and in a few years reduced him to a
state of entire helplessness.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.335

He has no hereditary claim to the gout, BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.336

and has been rather abstemious in his mode of living.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.337

His general health has been uncommonly firm and good.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.338

His appetite and spirits have seldom failed him; BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.339

and, with the exception of occasional pains in the muscles, as well as
the affected joints, he has passed the last twenty years of this life
with ease and tranquillity.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.340

The other patient is a lady, aged forty-five, the mother of nine children.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,34.341

She was first affected <P_35> four years ago, when the <font> menses
<$$font> became irregular, with pain, and enlargement of the joints of
the wrists.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.342

In six months the disease extended to the joints of two of the fingers
of the right hand, BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.343

and has lately attacked the right knee, and ancle: since which time she
has not been able to walk without assistance.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.344

She was troubled with chronic rheumatism after her last lying-in, five
years ago; BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.345

and at present complains of shifting, and rheumatic pains in various
parts of the body.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.346

She is likewise occasionally subject to a troublesome <font> diarrhoea.
<$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.347

In other respects she enjoys tolerable health.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.348

Both these patients have undergone a variety of medical treatment,
without any permanent advantage.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.349

Local bleeding, and the warm-bath relieved the pain at the onset of the
disease; BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.350

but the patients have latterly desisted from attempting any method of
relief, under a persuasion, that their complaint proceeds from gout.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.351

Indeed, in the former case, all hope of relief is at an end;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.352

in the latter, there is small chance of success, considering the
peculiarity of the malady, and delicate constitution of the patient.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,35.353

In treating on the effects of arsenic in chronic rheumatism, I merely
alluded to the case of a patient afflicted with nodosity of the <P_36>
joints, where the remedy had failed; BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.354

but I shall now describe the history of this interesting case,
and the method of treatment which terminated in complete success.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.355

James Bazeley, Aet. 22.  <font> Labourer, BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.357

December <$$font> 8, 1805.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.358

<$$heading>

Admitted into the Infirmary from a distant part of the country.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.360

He has been ill nine or ten months; BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.361

the joints of all the fingers of both hands are enlarged, stiff,
and painful.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.362

His right knee, and both ancles, have become knotty and protuberant,
within these few weeks; BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.363

and have rendered him incapable of walking many yards.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.364

The nodes are remarkably distinct and prominent, on the middle joints
of the fingers, and exquisitely sore to the touch; BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.365

but the integuments are neither inflamed nor discoloured.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.366

The patient looks wan, and emaciated, from confinement, pain, and anxiety.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.367

He was first seized with stiffness, heat, and pain in the hands and feet,
after a severe day's labour, in getting turnips during inclement weather.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.368

The pains afterwards shifted to different parts of the body,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.369

and at length settled in the joints.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.370

The complaint was treated before his admission, as rheumatism;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.371

and he supposed himself getting well when the nodes appeared.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,36.372

<P_37>

He was immediately put upon the arsenical solution, with an opiate
at bed-time; Care being taken to obviate costiveness with castor-oil.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.374

The solution was exhibited, to the amount of five drops, three times
a-day, until the 19th, without producing the slightest favorable change
in the disease; BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.375

indeed the nodes were rather increased in size, BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.376

and so stiff and painful were the joints, as to compel the patient to
keep his bed.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.377

20 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.378

Being unwilling to push the experiment any farther, recourse was
had to the trial of the <font> oleum jecoris aselli.  <$$font>
BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.379

He was ordered to take a $tablespoonful {TEXT:table_spoonful} twice or
thrice a-day, in beer; and frequently to rub the affected joints with
the oil, made warm.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.380

30 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.381

The medicine having griped and purged him, a few drops of <font>
tinct: opii, <$$font> were added to each dose, with proper effect.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.382

He has been able to get down two ounces of the oil daily,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.383

and has conquered, in some measure, his repugnance to the medicine.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.384

Still there is no visible improvement in the state of the nodes,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.385

and his pains at night are more acute than ever.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,37.386

Under these circumstances, the oil was <P_38> ordered to be discontinued
, BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.387

and he was put upon the following plan.  To go into a slipper-bath
each night at 100 degrees; and afterwards to take 12 grains of the Pulv:
ipecac: comp: with a proper regimen, to encourage sweating.  The following
powder to be exhibited three times a-day.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.388

<font> January <$$font> 7 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.390

The pains have been relieved by sweating; BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.391

but the patient's strength is thereby diminished, and the swelling and
hardness of the nodes not in the least removed.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.392

The sudorific powder was ordered to be omitted.  The bath to be continued
; but at the reduced temperature of 94.  The powders with Cort: and G:
Guaiac: to be repeated.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.393

14 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.394

The above method having failed, in obtaining more than a temporary
respite of pain; and the nodosity of the joints being rather increased
than diminished, I was resolved to try the effects of mercury, assisted
by a tepid bath.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,38.395

As the patient's stomach and bowels <P_39> were in too irritable a state
to permit its internal use, one scruple of strong mercurial ointment,
was ordered to be rubbed upon the inside of the legs and thighs
each night, after the use of a slipper-bath, heated to 94 degrees.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.396

16 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.397

Bark, and opium were joined to the use of the mercurial friction, as
the patient feels himself remarkably debilitated.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.398

20 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.399

Pains considerably abated in the knees and ancles, BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.400

but the nodes of the fingers have become rather inflamed.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.401

Ordered eight leeches to the joints most affected, and a continuance
of the bath, and other remedies, with half a pint of red-port, daily.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.402

28 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.403

The leeches produced an abatement of pain and inflammation;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.404

but there is no reduction in the size or hardness of the nodes.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.405

The soreness of the mouth is scarcely perceptible; BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.406

but, from the quickness and debility of the pulse, there can
be no doubt of the constitution being affected by the ointment.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.407

<font> February <$$font> 4 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.408

The patient is considerably improved within these few days.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.409

He suffers less pain {TEXT:missing_period} BARDSLEY-1807-1,39.410

The <P_40> nodes are evidently softer, and the joints less rigid.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.411

He is capable of moving every limb with more freedom and ease;
BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.412

and sits upon the $bedside {TEXT:bed_side} for an hour together.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.413

7 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.414

Has been gaining ground, though but slowly.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.415

The tendency to salivation having disappeared, the quantity of ointment
was directed to be increased to half a drachm, night and morning; and
the use of the tepid bath to be limited to three times a-week {COM:sic}.
BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.416

18 <font> th.  <$$font> BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.417

His mouth is now become very sore, BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.418

and the salivary discharge is increased to nearly a pint each twenty-four
hours.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.419

The nodes of the ancles and knees are greatly reduced,
BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.420

and those of the finger joints, are neither so hard nor so tender to
the touch.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.421

The tepid bath and mercurial frictions to be continued; and an astringent
with opium, occasionally administered, to check the action of the mercury
on the bowels.  BARDSLEY-1807-1,40.422
