Act II JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.3

Scene I.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.4

<font> The Baroness's Apartment.  <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.5

<font> The Baroness.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.6

Lisetta.  <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.7

<$$heading>

<font> Baroness.  <$$font> We have got up <font> <paren> looking at her
watch <$$paren> <$$font> very early, Lisetta.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.9

<font> Lis. <$$font> Who the deuce can sleep in these large cities?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,24.10

the coaches, the watchmen, the drums, the cats, the <P_25> corporals -
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.11

in short, one hears nothing but rattling, bawling, beating, wawling
, swearing, as if the night was made for every thing but sleeping.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.12

<font> Bar. <$$font> Time will hang heavy on our hands.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.13

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well then, to kill it, let us to the
toilet, to choose the dress we mean to give the first assault in.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.14

<font> Bar. <$$font> Why do you talk of assault, girl; when I
only come here to demand the performance of the articles of capitulation?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.15

<font> Lis. <$$font> Were the officer we dislodged here, and sent
compliment to, a proficient in politeness, he would have requested the
honour of paying his respects; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.16

and that might occupy some part on't.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.17

<font> Bar. <$$font> Ay, Lisetta, all officers are not Holbergs ;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.18

but indeed the compliment was made, only to have an opportunity of making
some inquiries about him.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.19

Lisetta, my heart tells me that I shall be successful, and find him here.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.20

<font> Lis. <$$font> We must not trust too much to the heart;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.21

it is but too apt to get into the mouth, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.22

and were the mouth silly enough to say all it dictates, it would
long since have been the fashion to wear padlocks at our lips.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.23

<font> Bar. <$$font> A whimsical sort of a jewel, truly;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.24

and yet, there are times when I should have no great objection to it.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.25

<font> Lis. <$$font> O Lord, no; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.26

better hide the finest set of teeth in the world, than let one's heart
be every moment leaping over them.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.27

<font> Bar. <$$font> Are you so discreet then?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.28

<font> Lis. <$$font> Not I, my lady; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.29

one seldom, you know, speaks of the virtues one has; but of those one
has not.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.30

<font> Bar. <$$font> An excellent reflection,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.31

and puts me in mind of my Holberg.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.32

<font> Lis. <$$font> And pray what does not?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.33

<font> Bar. <$$font> Both friends and foes allow him to be the
bravest, and most generous man alive; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.34

yet, who ever heard him talk of bravery or generosity?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.35

His sense of honour is delicate to a proverb.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.36

Yet honour is a word he ne'er makes use of.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.37

<font> Lis. <$$font> What virtues does he speak of then?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.38

<font> Bar. <$$font> Of none; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.39

for in none is he deficient.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,25.40

<P_26>

<font> Lis. <$$font> Yet I have often heard him profess his truth
and constancy to you.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.42

What, suppose he should be an inconstant?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.43

<font> Bar. <$$font> Are you in earnest?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.44

<font> Lis. <$$font> Why - how long is it since he wrote to you?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.45

<font> Bar. <$$font> He has written but once since the peace.
<font> <paren> sighs <$$paren> <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.46

<font> Lis. <$$font> That sigh is no prayer for the peace-makers.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.47

But what did he say?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.48

<font> Bar. <$$font>'The peace,'said he,'is concluded;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.49

and I consequently draw near to the accomplishment of all my wishes.
'JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.50

- But to write that to me but once, Lisetta!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.51

<font> Lis. <$$font> Ay, and to throw upon us the fatigues of
so long a journey,"for the accomplishment of his wishes, deserves "-
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.52

but suppose he should have already accomplished his wishes, and we should
find here that - <font> Bar. <$$font> That he were dead?  <font>
<paren> hastily <$$paren> <$$font> <font> Lis. <$$font> To you,
my lady, in the arms of another.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.53

<font> Bar. <$$font> No, Lisetta; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.54

I am not afraid of that - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.55

Holberg $can $not {TEXT:cannot} violate the most trivial engagement to
any one, much less a solemn contract with me,"the completion of which
only waited for my uncle's return from Italy. "<font> <paren> adjusting
her dress at a looking glass <$$paren> <$$font> JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.56

No, I am not afraid of that, Lisetta.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.57

His regiment was disbanded at the peace; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.58

who knows into what other regiment, or distant province, he may be
removed?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.59

who knows what circumstances - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.60

<font> <paren> a knocking at the door.  <$$paren> <$$font>
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.61

<font> Lis. <$$font> Somebody at the door.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.62

<font> Bar. <$$font> Let them come in.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.63

<$$heading>

<font> Katz. <$$font> Have I your ladyship's permission?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.70

<font> Lis. <$$font> O, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} our landlord.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.71

Let your body have the goodness to follow your head, that the door may
be shut.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.72

<font> Katz. <paren> entering with a pen behind his ear, paper and
ink in his hand <$$paren> <$$font> I come, my lady, to wish you a very
good morning; as likewise to you, my pretty maid.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.73

<font> Lis. <$$font> A civil man this.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,26.74

<P_27>

<font> Bar. <$$font> We thank you, Sir.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.76

<font> Lis. <$$font> And with you the same, Sir.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.77

<font> Katz. <$$font> Dare I take the liberty of asking whether
your ladyship has slept well under my poor roof?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.78

<font> Lis. <$$font> The roof is well enough,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.79

but the beds might have been better.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.80

<font> Katz. <$$font> Should there be any thing that does
not suit your ladyship, you have only to please to give your orders.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.81

<font> Lis. <$$font> Ay, ay; I mean to do that presently.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.82

<font> Katz. <$$font> This done, I come at the same time -
<font> <paren> taking the pen from behind his ear <$$paren> <$$font>
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.83

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well, what now?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.84

<font> Bar. <$$font> Your ladyship knows, without doubt, the wise
regulations of our police?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.85

<font> Bar. <$$font> Not I, indeed, landlord.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.86

<font> Katz. <$$font> We, landlords, are forbid to lodge any
strangers, of whatsoever rank or condition they may be, above four and
twenty hours, without sending their names, their rank, their business,
the probable length of their stay, and so forth, to the proper officers.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.87

<font> Bar. <$$font> Very well.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.88

<font> Katz. <$$font> Your ladyship will therefore be pleased to

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.89

<font> Bar. <$$font> Certainly: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.90

my name is - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.91

<font> Katz. <$$font> A moment's patience, if you please.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.92

Now your name, if you please, my lady.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.94

<font> Bar. <$$font> Baroness of Bruchsal.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.95

<font> Katz. <$$font> Of Bruchsal?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.96

- From whence, my lady?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.97

<font> Bar. <$$font> From my estate in Saxony.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.98

<font> Katz. <$$font> Estate in Saxony - hum, Saxony -
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.99

<font> Lis. <$$font> Well, why not Saxony?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.100

Pray is it a crime, here in Prussia, to come out of Saxony?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.101

<font> Katz. <$$font> A crime!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.102

O Lord, no: that would be a new kind of a crime indeed!
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.103

From Saxony, your ladyship.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.104

Saxony the fair, the free, the - ay, ay, Saxony: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.105

but Saxony is very large, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.106

and has many, what shall I call them, districts, provinces.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.107

- Our police is very particular, my lady.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.108

<font> Bar. <$$font> I understand: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.109

from Thuringia, then, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,27.110

<P_28>

<font> Katz. <$$font> Thuringia, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.112

ay, ay, that will do JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.113

<font> <paren> writes and then reads <$$paren> <$$font> The Baroness of
Bruchsal, from her estate in Thuringia, with her woman and two servants.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.114

<font> Lis. <$$font> Her woman!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.115

Meaning me, I suppose?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.116

<font> Katz. <$$font> Yes, my pretty maid.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.117

<font> Lis. <$$font> Now, landlord, instead of woman, please to
put down maid.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.118

The police is very particular, you know: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.119

"a mistake of that kind might spoil my marriage, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.120

and I might remain a maid, which is not my intention. "
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.121

I was born upon her ladyship's estate, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.122

was brought up with her ladyship; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.123

we are both of one age, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.124

for next candlemas we shall both be one and twenty.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.125

My name is Lisetta, and my sirname Willinger.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.126

"I should be happy that the police should be so well acquainted with
me, as to have no room for any apprensions {COM:sic} upon my account.
"JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.127

<font> Katz. <$$font> Very well, I shall set all that down by
and by.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.128

But now, my lady, your business here?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.129

<font> Bar. <$$font> My business!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.130

<font> Katz. <$$font> Ay; is your ladyship come to solicit any
thing from his majesty?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.131

<font> Bar. <$$font> Not I.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.132

<font> Katz. <$$font> Perhaps in our courts of law then?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.133

<font> Bar. <$$font> No.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.134

<font> Katz. <$$font> Or - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.135

<font> Bar. <$$font> No, no: I come here upon my own private
affairs.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.136

<font> Katz. <$$font> True, please your ladyship,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.137

but what may they be?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.138

<font> Bar. <$$font> They are - Faith, Lisetta, I believe we
shall be taken up.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.139

<font> Lis. <$$font> Hark you, landlord, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.140

but it must go no further than the police; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.141

we are come to kidnap one of the King's officers.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.142

<font> Bar. <$$font> Lisetta, are you out of your senses?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.143

Landlord, the madcap is jesting with you.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.144

<font> Katz. <$$font> Ay, ay, with me she may jest as much as she
pleases, but not with the high and mighty police.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.145

<font> Bar. <$$font> $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you, landlord,
I am quite a novice in such matters; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.146

suppose we were to defer your report till my uncle's arrival:
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,28.147

he will be here before the four and <P_29> twenty hours can expire,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.148

"and he will best know how much he must tell of his affairs, and what
he may conceal. "JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.149

- Is his apartment ready?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.150

<font> Lis. <$$font> Or have you some honest gentleman to turn
out on't first?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.151

<font> Bar. <$$font> Indeed, landlord, in such a case, you ought
not to have taken us in.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.152

The person you have turned out on our account is, I hear, an officer.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.153

<font> Katz. <$$font> A disbanded one, my lady.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.154

<font> Bar. <$$font> So much the worse; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.155

he is then unfortunate JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.156

and may deserve a better fate.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.157

The king $can $not {TEXT:cannot} know the merit of all the people in
his service.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.158

<font> Katz. <$$font> O yes, he does, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.159

he knows them all, all.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.160

<font> Bar. <$$font> But then he $can $n't {TEXT:can't} reward
them all.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.161

<font> Katz. <$$font> O yes, they all had reward enough during
the war.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.162

But if they will live away in time of peace, we landlords must take heed.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.163

I might safely have let this Colonel run a month or two longer here,
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.164

but $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} as well as it is.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.165

- Apropos, your ladyship understands jewels, no doubt.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.166

I must shew your ladyship a beauty of a ring: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.167

<font> <paren> taking the ring out <$$paren> <$$font> look here,

<font> Bar. <paren> looking at the ring <$$paren> <$$font> What

That ring - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.171

<font> Katz. <$$font> Ay, that ring is worth to one's own brother
300 pistoles.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.172

<font> Bar. <$$font> Look, Lisetta.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.173

<font> Katz <$$font>"That ring - very honestly,"very honestly indeed ,
madam; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.182

my dear, sweet lady, do not bring me into trouble: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.183

many things may have changed masters during the war, without the consent
of the original proprietors.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.184

I had it, I am sure, from a man I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} suspect from
a very good man.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,29.185

Holberg lodged here!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.197

"He pledged this ring to you! "JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.198

How came he into such difficulties?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.199

Here is money; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.205

here are notes; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.206

all are his.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.207

<font> Katz. <$$font> He was here a little while ago.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.210

<font> Bar. <$$font> Odious man!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.211

how could you treat him so unfriendly, so hardly, so cruelly?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,30.212

Indeed, indeed, my dear Colonel, there is more wisdom in mirth than
sorrow: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,34.399

the one blunts the weapons of misfortune, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,34.400

You are disbanded; that is, you have now the liberty and leisure to be

You may recollect, that the contribution exacted by his Majesty from
the country of Thuringia was to be in money: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.409

The sum was large, the notice short, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.410

and the orders sent to me were rigourous, in case of failure;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.411

to prevent their execution, therefore, I was obliged to lend the province
a considerable sum that was deficient.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.412

<font> Bar. <$$font> If your country will not see your innocence,

The generous action that lost you a few thousands, gained you the heart
of Caroline; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.419

and, if you do not rate her love above the paltry sum, take it on the
score of interest - sole heiress to my uncle, one of the richest noblemen
in Saxony.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.420

<font> Col. <$$font> No, Madam, no; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.421

your honour too; and loves his own.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,35.423

He was an excellent runner, to be sure; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,41.636

JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.743

On a sultry day, when both the sun and the enemy had set us in a glow,
your groom was milling with your canteen; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.744

you came to me - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.745

Warmans, says you, have you any thing to drink?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.746

- I reached my flask - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.747

you drank - did you not?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.748

was that out of character?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.749

Yet, on my soul, a draught of ditch water at that moment was of more
value than such trash at present: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.750

take it then, my dear Colonel, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.751

and look upon it as water sent for the general use of mankind.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.752

<font> Col. <$$font> I have told you, that I will not be your

<font> War. <$$font> At first $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} out of

you could not; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.755

that alters the cafe <font> <paren> angrily <$$paren> <$$font>.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.757

You will not be my debtor - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.758

are you not already then my debtor?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.759

<font> Col. <$$font> I your debtor!  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.760

<font> War. <$$font> Yes you.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.761

Or do you owe nothing to the man, who once took off from you the stroke
that would have cleft you down: and another time lopped of {COM:sic}
an arm just levelling a piece to pour inevitable death into your bosom?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.762

- What can make you more in debt, unless that life be of less value than
this trumpery?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.763

<font> Col. <$$font> Warmans, we are alone; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.764

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} well we are: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.765

the presence of a third person would render such discourse insufferable
boasting.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.766

Yes, I with pleasure acknowledge, that I twice have owed my life to you:
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,44.767

But <P_45> what, friend, has been ever wanting on my side, to have done
full as much for you?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.768

<font> War. <$$font> Only the opportunity, my brave Colonel;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.769

but do not grudge me an opportunity - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.770

take this.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.771

<font> Col. <$$font> Warmans, why will you not understand me?
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.772

I say, it is improper I should be your debtor, at least so situated as I
am at present.  <font> War. <$$font> That is, you will reserve my
purse'till you have no occasion to borrow; or I no money left to lend you.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.773

<font> Col. <$$font> You have, yourself, occasion for your money.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.774

<font> War. <$$font> None - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.775

whoever wants a Serjeant Major will give him subsistence.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.776

<font> War. <$$font> I have no views beyond my station;
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.778

In short, at present I have no need of money; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.780

you have; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.781

your affairs must soon be settled, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.782

and then you shall repay with interest - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.783

I lend it you on interest.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.784

<font> Col. <$$font> No more, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.785

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} not hear of it.  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.786

<font> War. <$$font> On my soul, it is on interest that I lend
it, JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.787

What, thought I often to myself - what will become of thee, Warmans,
in thy old age, when many years and many wounds have made an halbert too
heavy for thy hand - when thou hast nothing left, and when thou must shame
the honour of thy former life and go a begging?  JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.788

No, thou shalt not go a begging, thought I: JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.789

thou shalt go to Colonel Holberg; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.790

he will share his utmost penny with thee - JOHNSTONE-1786-2,45.791

thou shalt bask in his better fortune - shed thy grey hairs unsullied by
disgrace; and be borne to an honourable grave, as becomes an old soldier.

<$$font> Which must have been, that you would never abandon a woman of

Well, well; I would rather hear you tell me all that.
JOHNSTONE-1786-2,50.974

<font> Col. <$$font> Madam, I meant to tell you, that our
separation must be imputed, not to me, but to inevitable fate: which
calls you to the enjoyment of every happiness <P_51> friends, fortune, and
your country can afford; while it fixes me here, to suffer the extreme of
wretchedness in vindication of my injured honour; JOHNSTONE-1786-2,51.975
