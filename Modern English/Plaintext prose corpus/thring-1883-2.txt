<$$heading>

The teacher preparing for his work has passed by; THRING-1883-2,155.8

now let his class stand up and give some account of themselves.
THRING-1883-2,155.9

There are four main facts brought out by experience in dealing with the
young mind.  THRING-1883-2,155.10

First, the reasoning power of the young, the power, that is, to follow
a logical chain of reasoning, is non-existent.  THRING-1883-2,155.11

Secondly, the young have no power of attention.  THRING-1883-2,155.12

Attention has to be learnt as much as any other lesson.
THRING-1883-2,155.13

Thirdly, the memory of the young is very good, if they care for what
they are doing.  THRING-1883-2,155.14

Fourthly, there is no power in a young boy to master a subject thoroughly.
THRING-1883-2,155.15

Thoroughness requires a strength which does not exist.
THRING-1883-2,155.16

These four facts, for facts they are, are <P_156> the four first problems
to be dealt with by the teacher.  THRING-1883-2,156.17

The complete absence, practically, of the reasoning faculty, so far as
learning by means of it goes, determines at once the whole character of
good teaching at the beginning.  THRING-1883-2,156.18

There must be simple statements, and simple explanations.
THRING-1883-2,156.19

The early stages require the new ideas and facts to be put like little
pictures before the pupil, without any attempt to show the mechanism,
as it were, by which the effect is produced.  THRING-1883-2,156.20

Logical progression is out of the horizon.  THRING-1883-2,156.21

The all-important factor of the mind to be taught must be the starting
point.  THRING-1883-2,156.22

If processes are shown, it must also be, so to say, pictorially, in some
subject already very familiar.  THRING-1883-2,156.23

The inside of common things is intensely interesting to the curious
child, THRING-1883-2,156.24

witness the number of toys that have been the victims of scientific
research, and broken, to find out what was inside.  THRING-1883-2,156.25

But then they were toys, thorough property, entirely in the power,
manual and mental, of the owners.  THRING-1883-2,156.26

Wherever there is the feeling of thorough property, there is also the
wish for thorough knowledge, THRING-1883-2,156.27

and the child delights in having the structure of the familiar thing
laid bare.  THRING-1883-2,156.28

But even then, much as they like to know all about what is their own
, the knowledge is a knowledge by sight, not a matter of reasoning.
THRING-1883-2,156.29

This then is the principle of all early work, either eye-sight, or
mental sight.  THRING-1883-2,156.30

<P_157>

Either actually show the bit of teaching, which often can be done;
THRING-1883-2,157.32

or let the bit be a little, plain statement, a kind of stamp, which the
mind can see without trouble.  THRING-1883-2,157.33

Trouble enough will come in due time.  THRING-1883-2,157.34

This principle requires the teacher to lay aside the fascinating
shapeliness of a clear-cut system, and submit himself to the yoke of
the boy-mind.  THRING-1883-2,157.35

Rigid, formulated, square statements, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} find
their way with their corners into the little tortuous windings of the
little mind, with all its blind mazes, passages that lead to nothing,
obstructions of previous ideas, mobs of small idolatries, idolatries of
play, idolatries of day-dreams, combined with absolute incapacity to bear
the unyielding thrust of logic in its fine tissues.  THRING-1883-2,157.36

The teacher must indeed have a logical plan of his own, which he does
not lose sight of; THRING-1883-2,157.37

but the actual teaching has to be imparted bit by bit, as the learner
is fitted to take it, with many illustrations, and digressions, which
are not digressions, but round-about ways of arriving at points, where
the direct path is blocked.  THRING-1883-2,157.38

A dull boy's mind is a wise man's problem.  THRING-1883-2,157.39

Mind is the teacher's real subject; and how to excite thought, and
arouse interest, without making much demand on the logical faculty,
the first aspect which the work of mind presents.  THRING-1883-2,157.40

Perhaps, considering what is almost universally done, the first rule to
be laid down is a prohibition.  THRING-1883-2,157.41

<P_158>

Never try to fill the little mind with lumber, under colour of its being
of use by and by.  THRING-1883-2,158.43

Lumber does not excite thought, THRING-1883-2,158.44

lumber does not interest, THRING-1883-2,158.45

lumber does breed disgust; THRING-1883-2,158.46

nothing should be put into the mind which is not wanted immediately
, and which is not also the easiest way of meeting the want.
THRING-1883-2,158.47

The pupil ought to be made to feel that thought is a pleasure, and a
power; and that learning means being taught to think by easy steps.
THRING-1883-2,158.48

For example.  He knows that the having learnt to read and write has opened
up to him treasures, which he would not now give up, THRING-1883-2,158.49

and therefore he can be made to believe that the new tasks, however
distasteful, are going to do the same thing in a still higher degree,
and land him in unknown empires.  THRING-1883-2,158.50

But why should they be so distasteful?  THRING-1883-2,158.51

Thought in its true sense is not distasteful.  THRING-1883-2,158.52

When mind enters into the works of mind, and receives life from them,
the new life is not distasteful.  THRING-1883-2,158.53

The whole mighty realm of imagination is thought, whether it be
the imagination, which creates the Midsummer Night's Dream, or the
imagination, which sets the baby child in the nursery on the floor, and
surrounds it with a living kingdom in the guise of broken toys, and makes
it lisp to a much-battered doll,"You are the Queen.  "THRING-1883-2,158.54

Imagination is not distasteful.  THRING-1883-2,158.55

There are plenty of thought-pictures in common things for any one who
knows how to paint them, or, <P_159> better still, make his pupils
paint them.  THRING-1883-2,159.56

And thought is the beginning, thought the middle, and thought the end
of a learner's work.  THRING-1883-2,159.57

Let not the teacher pile in lumber that is not thought.
THRING-1883-2,159.58

The learner can be made to see without difficulty that new thoughts,
and the power of receiving thoughts and thinking thoughts, are a gain
and a pleasure in the long run, because he has already found them to be
a pleasure, or ought to have done so.  THRING-1883-2,159.59

The next step is easy.  THRING-1883-2,159.60

The learner can be made to understand the obvious truth, that language
, and literature are the great exercise ground of thought, and mind;
inasmuch as all thought passes through language.  THRING-1883-2,159.61

Words are the every-day and all-day messengers of common life, as well
as the varied and intelligent expression afterwards of the thoughts of
the greatest thinkers.  THRING-1883-2,159.62

There is no reason in the nature of things why the child in the nursery
should not understand, aye, and feel gratefully the meaning of Teaching ;
and be taught through the familiar sights and words the pleasure of being
taught, and led on to work with interest in collecting new material ,
and in thinking over what has been collected.  THRING-1883-2,159.63

This truth is not impaired by the fact that much has to be taken on
trust at first, much to be learnt on faith, which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be fully explained at the time.  THRING-1883-2,159.64

It only means that there are grounds for this faith; that these grounds
<P_160> should be made plain; and that as the demands for labour and
patience increase, the faith should increase in proportion, from the
sense experienced daily of an increase in power and pleasure, which a
skilful teacher will unobtrusively keep up.  THRING-1883-2,160.65

There is no more reason in the nature of things why a boy should rejoice
in the weak and inactive mind, than in the weak and inactive body.
THRING-1883-2,160.66

If bodily training consisted in carrying heavy stones from one hole
to another, and, as fast as they were thrown in, pulling them out,
and taking them back again, there would be no lack of feeble bodies.
THRING-1883-2,160.67

Every boy would be as weak as a resolute evasion of being employed in
doing nothing laboriously could make him.  THRING-1883-2,160.68

How much of child labour in knowledge, falsely so called, is a doing
nothing laboriously, with much solemn jargon, and much real infliction.
THRING-1883-2,160.69

The simple formula,"give a beginner something to think about, "sets this
all straight at once.  THRING-1883-2,160.70

Something to think about!  THRING-1883-2,160.71

This $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be a sawn-out board of dry knowledge.
THRING-1883-2,160.72

Something to think about!  THRING-1883-2,160.73

This must be an object of interest, partly understood therefore, partly
new, familiar, but unknown.  THRING-1883-2,160.74

Nature has given this in the learner's native language, and its treasures
of beautiful thought.  THRING-1883-2,160.75

Whenever the nations believe in the training of mind being the first
thing , and the heaping up of knowledge the <P_l6l> second, the language
and literature of each nation will be studied first.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.76

The mediaeval process of self-flagellation will be left off, and work
made as easy and delightful as possible, with the absolute certainty that
when the preliminaries are over, the stubborn realities of the greater
achievements of mind and their demands will give plenty of labour,
and plenty of pain, if pain is wanted.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.77

The beginner ought to be made to feel that the gain is worth any pain
by the time he is called on to make the sacrifice.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.78

This principle excludes all cut-and-dried definitions, packets of rules,
and formulated results.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.79

It requires, if such an illustration may be allowed, that the young
should learn natural history and botany in the woods and fields first,
and not be set down in a Museum to dried specimens, and stuffed animals ,
and elaborate classification, till they have learnt the value of a Museum,
and its meaning.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.80

There is another subject almost as much within reach as language, which is
entirely neglected as a training subject for mind, though equally open to
all, which demands nicety of hand and eye, great mechanical skill , and
introduces the dullest at once to strange discoveries in common things,
that greatest point of true Education.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.81

It is marvellous that the grand training of Drawing has never taken its
place as a teaching power.  THRING-1883-2,l6l.82

The learner is met on the very threshold by the truth <P_162> of truths,
that he has eyes that see not, and hands which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
do his will.  THRING-1883-2,162.83

He finds out that the lines go in a way he knows not, though they
are known.  THRING-1883-2,162.84

He looks at a wall, THRING-1883-2,162.85

and sees what he sees, THRING-1883-2,162.86

but is utterly unable to record what he sees; THRING-1883-2,162.87

all is wrong the moment he begins.  THRING-1883-2,162.88

The very chair he sits in is a puzzle of untold difficulty.
THRING-1883-2,162.89

He is brought face to face with that grand fact of the wondrous perfection
of accurate power in the midst of which he has moved unknowingly,
THRING-1883-2,162.90

and he comes in sight of the highest truth that man can attain to,
a perception of his own unconscious ignorance, utter incapacity,
and clumsiness.  THRING-1883-2,162.91

A fresh secret leaps out of every leaf, THRING-1883-2,162.92

there is not a pebble which is not turned into a world.
THRING-1883-2,162.93

The transformation which follows immediately the smallest child is
made to Draw, and set to observe the what?  and the why?  in things,
THRING-1883-2,162.94

and attention turned on to the endless discoveries of ignorance which
are disclosed in this way, is more rapid, and complete perhaps than in
any other exercise of mind.  THRING-1883-2,162.95

This is, or may be, the beginning.  THRING-1883-2,162.96

Later on the art of composition, that is, of intelligent arrangement
of thought, is more effectually illustrated by a picture, than in any
other way.  THRING-1883-2,162.97

It is no concern of this treatise to glorify the painter's skill;
THRING-1883-2,162.98

but the neglected world of truest teaching, which is waiting to be used
whenever Drawing is taught as a matter <P_163> of mind, not of hand,
and is recognized as one of the first great exercise grounds of mind,
does belong to the Teacher's province.  THRING-1883-2,163.99

The impossibility of jumbling ideas together in a Drawing without
detection in the first place, and a detection, which can be made plain
to the eye, in the second, is a virtue, which would be very valuable in
much teaching work in language; THRING-1883-2,163.100

and most important of all, the one vivid impression with everything
leading up to it and back from it, which is the life of a picture,
is the life of a lesson also.  THRING-1883-2,163.101

But how often a lesson has nothing pictorial, firm, or unblurred in it.
THRING-1883-2,163.102

Many men pass their days without ever having <font> composed <$$font>
a lesson in their lives.  THRING-1883-2,163.103

Their statements are all equally forcible, or equally feeble, as the
case may be.  THRING-1883-2,163.104

Faults are knocked about at random, as they occur, without the slightest
attempt to mark some strongly, and to drop others into the background.
THRING-1883-2,163.105

All is on the same level.  No definite piece of teaching brought out,
no high light; no definite style of blunder unobtrusively stamped out.
THRING-1883-2,163.106

But in Drawing the difference between a true composition and this
chinese-plate work is seen at once; and the necessity for decision and
skill in arrangement self-evident.  THRING-1883-2,163.107

Every good Drawing is a model lesson, in which what has to be taught is
imprinted at once by a single skilful stroke.  THRING-1883-2,163.108

And no one knows the skill which has <P_l64> blended so many parts
into one thought-stamp, until the confusion of untrained work is seen.
THRING-1883-2,l64.109

There is no work so untrained as the attempt of a master to uncoil a
chain of reasoning, and put it into the boy mind.  THRING-1883-2,l64.110

Long before the end is reached the beginning has disappeared.
THRING-1883-2,l64.111

Nothing that is not valuable piecemeal is valuable in teaching the young.
THRING-1883-2,l64.112

The best teaching will be like S. Paul's Epistles, where every
single verse is powerful and plain, however subtle or elaborate the
argument of the whole may be.  THRING-1883-2,l64.113

Good teaching will at least have each impress powerful and plain, and
be working secretly towards a given end.  THRING-1883-2,l64.114

A feeble stroke is useless.  THRING-1883-2,l64.115

Too much giving of reasons is worse than useless.  THRING-1883-2,l64.116

A Teacher must be content to omit much, and not be concerned about the
glossiness of his work.  THRING-1883-2,l64.117

The mind of a working, vigorous little boy is much like his clothes,
very untidy, but very serviceable, entirely regardless of every thing
but the object at the moment.  THRING-1883-2,l64.118

No doubt order and tidiness are part of the training;
THRING-1883-2,l64.119

but dress boots $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} do for turnip fields, or mountains.
THRING-1883-2,l64.120

Strength is needed first.  THRING-1883-2,l64.121

Strong ideas are wanted, put forth by an unseen plan.
THRING-1883-2,l64.122

Every good teacher will compose his lessons, and compose them on this
principle.  THRING-1883-2,l64.123

Interest must be excited, faith inspired, mind dealt with.
THRING-1883-2,l64.124

Chapter V.  THRING-1883-2,165.127

The Practice of Teaching.  THRING-1883-2,165.128

<font> Inattention, Indifference, Sleep.  <$$font> THRING-1883-2,165.129

<$$heading>

The next fact that has to be dealt with is attention.
THRING-1883-2,165.131

Much misapprehension exists on this head.  THRING-1883-2,165.132

Because people are attentive, when strong interest is roused, there is a
common idea that attention is natural, and inattention a culpable fault.
THRING-1883-2,165.133

But the boy mind is much like a frolicking puppy, always in motion,
restless, but never in the same position two minutes together, when
really awake.  THRING-1883-2,165.134

Naturally his body partakes of this unsettled character.
THRING-1883-2,165.135

Attention is a lesson to be learned; and quite as much a matter of
training as any other lesson.  THRING-1883-2,165.136

A teacher will be saved much useless friction if he acknowledges this
fact, and instead of expecting attention, which he will not get, starts
at once with the intention of teaching <P_166> it; being well assured
that it would be just as sensible to look for the Latin Grammar to be
spun off the reel by the light of nature, without book, as for attention
to be got without training.  THRING-1883-2,166.137

A teacher will treat this as a lesson, and exercise all his skill in
teaching it, and be patient with beginners, and command it by life,
good humour, and go.  THRING-1883-2,166.138

It is curious how entirely in most cases the progress of the lesson
reflects the temper of the master.  THRING-1883-2,166.139

If this is true, it is obvious that the personal power of the master
in all bits of small discipline and the general swing of the class
, will decide absolutely in a fair time the habits of the class.
THRING-1883-2,166.140

A sleepy manner, however strong the real interest taken by the master
may be, produces in the taught either laziness and apathy in the lazy,
or tricks in the puppy section.  THRING-1883-2,166.141

It is most disastrous in anything belonging to discipline to overlook
beginnings.  THRING-1883-2,166.142

No leak ever broke up a dyke more certainly than trifles passed over
break up the order of a class.  THRING-1883-2,166.143

There is however a worse fault still, a fault which is almost universal
; THRING-1883-2,166.144

this is, to legalise insubordination by having a set of small routine
punishments, and imposing them regularly.  THRING-1883-2,166.145

This makes a regular crop of the fault; THRING-1883-2,166.146

and the fault becomes an established institution, THRING-1883-2,166.147

and what began as a bit of carelessness ends by being a tolerated crime.
THRING-1883-2,166.148

Little breaches of order ought to be <P_167> met by the personal authority
of the teacher's Words and influence.  THRING-1883-2,167.149

If that is not enough, they should be promptly stamped out by real
severity.  THRING-1883-2,167.150

Inattention creeps in at another door.  THRING-1883-2,167.151

The operators are apt to forget the class, which is their real work,
and to be absorbed in the book, and the boy doing it, whilst the rest
are comparatively disregarded.  THRING-1883-2,167.152

The rest accordingly are inattentive, THRING-1883-2,167.153

for the operator is teaching them inattention by being inattentive
to them.  THRING-1883-2,167.154

They are his main care, THRING-1883-2,167.155

and not to care for them brings its own punishment in not being cared for.
THRING-1883-2,167.156

First one, then another, takes advantage of the absent eye,
THRING-1883-2,167.157

and disorder begins, THRING-1883-2,167.158

and in spite of spasmodic severity becomes the rule.
THRING-1883-2,167.159

Instant, watchful, if need be, pitiless repression of the first sign of
inattention is the only law of discipline.  THRING-1883-2,167.160

Nothing ought to escape a teacher that the boys do, THRING-1883-2,167.161

for he is there to train the boys in what they do.  THRING-1883-2,167.162

Querulous complaints of disorder, and the inflicting of heavier, and
heavier punishments, - at intervals, are the sure indication of one who
forgets his duty to the class, and is inattentive to them, whilst at
best he mistakes the lesson for his subject, and at worst is sleepy,
capricious, and incapable himself.  THRING-1883-2,167.163

As mind has to be dealt with mind must be there.  THRING-1883-2,167.164

And however clever the performer may be, he might as well stand up, and
solemnly set <P_168> about giving a lesson to the clothes of the class
hanging round the room on pegs, whilst the owners were playing cricket,
as to the so-called class, if the boys are careless, playing, or noisy.
THRING-1883-2,168.165

Culpable inattention in the boys is above all things a master's fault.
THRING-1883-2,168.166

Able, earnest men, who attend to the class, will always find the class
attend to them.  THRING-1883-2,168.167

But inattention is not always wilful.  THRING-1883-2,168.168

There is an unconscious kind that is very dangerous, though inoffensive.
THRING-1883-2,168.169

Many a good, disappointed boy has been disappointed, because he has
been allowed to blunder on in utter inattention when he thought he was
at work, and no one has ever made plain to him the difference between
sitting over his books, and an eager, intelligent love for the work to
be done.  THRING-1883-2,168.170

How to learn ought sometimes to be taught, and delusions about work done
away with.  THRING-1883-2,168.171

Sleep is sleep, whether the pillow be Aeschylus, or goose feathers;
THRING-1883-2,168.172

and sitting in the most sacred chair is not study; truths lamentably lost
sight of by many a meritorious, mistaken student.  THRING-1883-2,168.173

The state of mind necessary before anything can be done; the state of
mind necessary whilst anything is being done will not be left out by any
Teacher, who has realised that his subject is mind.  THRING-1883-2,168.174

The toiler and moiler ought to be plainly told, and told again, and again,
the real object in view, and <P_169> the preliminary processes necessary
before any true work is done.  THRING-1883-2,169.175

Nothing is more pitiable than the spectacle of a boy spending hours of
self-denial, stupefying himself by groaning over tasks unattended to,
because he is groaning, and self-tortured; when all might be spared,
if anyone had ever given him a lesson on the subject of his own mind,
and shown him the real purpose of the work he is supposed to be doing,
and how surely, and quietly it can be done.  Whereas a great nightmare
is on his soul, an infinity of unattainable knowledge fills all space
for him.  THRING-1883-2,169.176

He is like one who should sit down, and mourn over the size of the
world, as a reason for not using the excellent pair of legs nature has
given him for traversing that portion of it which he has to do with.
THRING-1883-2,169.177

Granted however that the teacher is a teacher, and that the class knows
what it is about, and is not unwilling, mere arrangement has infinite
power for good or evil.  THRING-1883-2,169.178

A class ought to sit, or stand, compactly, under the master's eye, so
that at a glance he can take in all, and they all are in touch with him.
THRING-1883-2,169.179

The moment that from the numbers, or from the structure of the room,
the master's presence does not pervade the whole body, and make itself
felt everywhere; if whilst speaking to one he is cut off from the
many, there may be discipline, <P_170> if he is a man of decision,
THRING-1883-2,170.180

but there will not be attention.  THRING-1883-2,170.181

The mechanical necessities of attention have not been complied with;
THRING-1883-2,170.182

an unreality, a working falsehood, has got into the work,
THRING-1883-2,170.183

and the work will suffer.  THRING-1883-2,170.184

For the same reason, no boy ought ever to sit with his back to the master,
unless he is writing; in which case the paper he is writing on, and what
he is doing, is in front of the eye.  THRING-1883-2,170.185

Still more important, if possible, is attitude.  THRING-1883-2,170.186

Attitude makes false work, as well as betrays false work.
THRING-1883-2,170.187

A competent judge shall tell in a moment by simply looking through the
window where a class is at work, whether good work can be going on there.
THRING-1883-2,170.188

The attitude of the boys will show.  THRING-1883-2,170.189

For though there can be true outward observance in some degree without
inward truth, the converse is not possible.  THRING-1883-2,170.190

There $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be inward reality without producing an
outside corresponding to it.  THRING-1883-2,170.191

It is a law of nature that the mind acts on the body, and makes it follow
any real emotion.  THRING-1883-2,170.192

Everyone knows how difficult it is to restrain the outward look of anger
, if angry; of sorrow, if sorrowful; and so on, through the whole range
of feeling.  THRING-1883-2,170.193

But what is the meaning of this excepting that any reality within
of necessity comes out in a corresponding bodily expression; and -
that the bodily expression does show the absence of any real feeling,
as well as the presence.  THRING-1883-2,170.194

<P_171>

This is a law of nature.  THRING-1883-2,171.196

It is equally a law of nature that every outward gesture, or expression
, acts on the mind, and has a tendency to produce the inward feeling.
THRING-1883-2,171.197

Sir Charles Bell in his book on Expression, which every one ought to
read, tells us"It is a fundamental law of our nature that the mind
shall have its powers developed through the influence of the body,
"THRING-1883-2,171.198

and he goes on to say;"How much influence the instrument of expression
has in first rousing the mind into that state of activity, which we call
passion or emotion, we may learn from the power of the body to control
these affections.  THRING-1883-2,171.199

I have often observed, says Burke, that on mimicking the looks and
gestures of angry, or placid, or frightened, or daring men, I have
involuntarily found my mind turned to that passion, whose appearance I
endeavoured to imitate. "THRING-1883-2,171.200

Here is a fact for consideration, THRING-1883-2,171.201

the outward gesture produced the inward feeling.  THRING-1883-2,171.202

A very simple experiment, so simple as to disgust all who want their
prophet to come out and make a show, will convince anyone of the infinite
power of this fact.  THRING-1883-2,171.203

There are things called arm-chairs, THRING-1883-2,171.204

an ordinary upholsterer can make them.  THRING-1883-2,171.205

Nevertheless let a healthy person, comfortably warm, compose himself
in mystic fashion in their sacred precincts, and shut his eyes,
THRING-1883-2,171.206

and a very few minutes sometimes will convince others, <P_172> however
much beyond the reach of conviction he may be himself, of the potency
of attitude.  THRING-1883-2,172.207

The various ways in which indolent minds maltreat indolent bodies, and
are dullified by them in revenge, are an approach to this somnolence,
and not calculated to increase the power of coping with difficulties
of learning.  THRING-1883-2,172.208

A Teacher will not neglect this great law of nature.
THRING-1883-2,172.209

Few suspect how much the waters of Helicon are contaminated by the slime
which oozes in through this unguarded sluice.  THRING-1883-2,172.210

Boys are permitted to stand up to construe with hand in pocket.
THRING-1883-2,172.211

And too often the slouching attitude, the sprawling, and lolling about,
is enough to reveal how little is really being done within, and alas to
prevent more from being done, even though the operator may be successful
in turning out prize winners; THRING-1883-2,172.212

but as a rule this is not the case.  THRING-1883-2,172.213

These are the quarters from which come complaints of the boys, of their
being disorderly and inattentive, of their disregard for authority,
mixed with bewailings of pains taken in vain, and querulous talking
of throwing pearls before swine, varied by constant punishment, and
invoking of higher authority; when all the time the operator has been
disregarding laws of nature; and only had to make his class stand upright,
take their hands out of their pockets, hold up their heads, and comport
themselves in an intelligent way, like persons eager <P_173> to learn,
instead of young neer-do-weels the first Sunday they have escaped from
the National School.  THRING-1883-2,173.214

In some instances it is a good plan to make the boy called up to construe
come to a particular place as a kind of rostrum before he begins.
THRING-1883-2,173.215

It rouses attention, THRING-1883-2,173.216

and gives an idea of the importance of the work.  THRING-1883-2,173.217

A system of taking places judiciously worked, and not made too much of,
may be very useful in the lower classes; THRING-1883-2,173.218

there is a little value in the mere fact of being on the move.
THRING-1883-2,173.219

A better plan still, as far as it goes, since it does not take the minds
of masters, or pupils, off their work, and make the success, or failure of
individuals so prominent, is the plan of making a first class , after the
boys have been at work two or three weeks, and promoting and degrading
those who deserve it, giving some privileges to the first class as well
as the honour of selection.  THRING-1883-2,173.220

Finally there is another most unfailing hot-bed of inattention, a perfect
invention for growing it, more fertile even than too great numbers in
a class, - the length of time spent in school.  THRING-1883-2,173.221

Pharaoh will have his tale of hours.  THRING-1883-2,173.222

And nature will have her perquisites out of them.  THRING-1883-2,173.223

Let any adult, however practised, however zealous, under five and twenty
years of age, test himself for just one day, by an hour-glass, and try
and see how long he can continue to keep up his attention at a stretch
over <P_174> the acquiring of new knowledge, THRING-1883-2,174.224

and a sad experience will teach him, if he faithfully stops his hour-glass
the moment he relaxes, how ludicrously few are the minutes during which
he is actually hard at work, compared with the time he believed himself
to be spending.  THRING-1883-2,174.225

But there is a far more rough and ready, yet sufficient, test of
attention.  THRING-1883-2,174.226

Most people hear sermons.  THRING-1883-2,174.227

A unanimous verdict will be given that the mind wanders occasionally even
during good sermons, eyelids have been known to droop, and contemplation
to be prodigal of nods, THRING-1883-2,174.228

yea there have been seen gracious men asleep, whose general appearance
scarcely betokened that ill health or exhaustion were the irresistible
causes of their slumber.  THRING-1883-2,174.229

There have been dull sermons, THRING-1883-2,174.230

and will be again; THRING-1883-2,174.231

it will be confessed that the percentage of actual sleep in a dull sermon
is a very appreciable quantity, a visible gauge of the condition of some
of the congregation; whilst who shall pretend to calculate the invisible
torpor, or wandering of mind.  THRING-1883-2,174.232

But it is worth considering that the dullest sermon ever preached is as
the blast of a trumpet compared with misunderstood lessons to a heavy,
ignorant boy, who has no belief in education, no knowledge of its aims
or value, no confidence that he can get it even if it is worth having,
and is only alive to the fact that he knows nothing, and hates it all.
THRING-1883-2,174.233

There <P_175> have been also dull operators in school, as well as dull
preachers in Church.  THRING-1883-2,175.234

How can attention be secured under such circumstances?
THRING-1883-2,175.235

Here then is a real problem.  THRING-1883-2,175.236

There is natural waste also, a kind of leakage always going on,
which must be taken into account in fixing the times for study.
THRING-1883-2,175.237

The problem is very real.  THRING-1883-2,175.238

If the times are too long, inattention is bred as in a hot-bed.
THRING-1883-2,175.239

If the times are not long enough the idle boys do nothing.
THRING-1883-2,175.240

Time to soak, so to say, as well as time to dip, is required.
THRING-1883-2,175.241

Natural incapacity forbids the crowding much into a small space.
THRING-1883-2,175.242

Strength, and energy, and training must be there before this can be done.
THRING-1883-2,175.243

And they are not there; THRING-1883-2,175.244

they have, if possible, to be produced.  THRING-1883-2,175.245

The pressure of external opinion, which judges by externals,
generally demands much too long a period of compulsory attendance.
THRING-1883-2,175.246

This form of difficulty can be met sometimes by allowing the class to
go out for ten minutes in fine weather, and ventilating the room, and
their brains.  THRING-1883-2,175.247

Preparation of the lessons out of school, or, if in school,
in a less formal way, corrects in some degree this constraint.
THRING-1883-2,175.248

If Pharaoh still insists on too long school hours, and relief is
impossible in the matter of time and place, then graduation of the
subjects, beginning with the hardest, and ending with pleasanter
tasks , English <P_176> poetry, for instance, is the only refuge left.
THRING-1883-2,176.249

Indeed this graduation always ought to be pressed into service.
THRING-1883-2,176.250

Apparently, three quarters of an hour is the longest time that an average
class can be kept at work on the same subject by a master, with advantage.
THRING-1883-2,176.251

It will have been plain from these few remarks, first, that attention
has to be taught, and does not come by the light of nature; secondly
that there is a common-sense science of the physical and mechanical
conditions necessary to secure attention; and lastly, and most of all
, that attention rises or falls in the barometer in proportion to the
master's ability.  THRING-1883-2,176.252

Inattention is a master's sin.  THRING-1883-2,176.253

It is a weed which above all others grows on badly farmed ground.
THRING-1883-2,176.254

Chapter VI.  THRING-1883-2,177.257

The Practice of Teaching.  THRING-1883-2,177.258

<font> Memory.  THRING-1883-2,177.259

Feed it.  <$$font> THRING-1883-2,177.260

<$$heading>

Memory next claims notice as the most powerful quality in the young.
THRING-1883-2,177.262

Every advantage ought to be taken of this to interest them, to fill them
with precious freightage, and new wonders, and material of the best kind.
THRING-1883-2,177.263

They ought never to be loaded, like the donkey, with salt, a heavy weight
all along the road, but which melts away, and leaves an empty sack the
first river that has to be crossed.  THRING-1883-2,177.264

By memory is meant that strange carrying power, of which all partake, and
which some have to a marvellous degree, by which the owner receives and
stores up, in many instances with no effort, whatever comes within reach.
THRING-1883-2,177.265

It is a natural gift, born with the possessor, and in no way dependent
on his intelligent appreciation in the beginning.  THRING-1883-2,177.266

It is a mere cart power which holds whatever is <P_178> thrown into it,
even nonsense which jingles, mere sounds which run with any cadence,
THRING-1883-2,178.267

and in fact is the faculty of an elaborate parrot catching sounds,
and by no means tied down to understanding.  THRING-1883-2,178.268

This early faculty is entirely distinct from the power acquired afterwards
of fixing in the mind by conscious effort, and strong interest, that
which is judged worthy of being fixed.  THRING-1883-2,178.269

Memory in this first sense is an instinct of the young,
THRING-1883-2,178.270

and often passes away in that shape as the owner grows older.  Whereas the
strong impressions, by which the attentive mind stamps indelibly what
it wishes to retain, are the result of an effort; and the necessity for
that effort, and the power of making it, are the result of teaching,
and can be definitely taught; THRING-1883-2,178.271

the two are distinct.  THRING-1883-2,178.272

The natural gift is now under consideration.  THRING-1883-2,178.273

And the fact that the young are pre-eminently endowed with this natural
gift is most important in educating the young.  THRING-1883-2,178.274

It simply amounts to this, that whilst the young are almost devoid of
any power of connected reasoning, they are superlatively endowed with
the power of receiving and collecting materials.  THRING-1883-2,178.275

The child has memory in childhood, reasoning power in manhood as his
main life functions; like the frog, which breathes through gills in
early life, and attains to lungs in its respectable years of discretion.
THRING-1883-2,178.276

Nature <P_179> prescribes accordingly that the main business of the
young is to collect material; a business which the infinite novelty of
the new world not a little contributes to enliven.  THRING-1883-2,179.277

This determines the first great axiom, or what ought to be the first
great axiom of early teaching; open Fairyland.  THRING-1883-2,179.278

Endeavour to delight, interest, fascinate the child by judiciously
supplying melodious sounds, splendid imagery, touching narratives,
noble adventure, noble endurance, noble sufferings.  THRING-1883-2,179.279

There is a fearful theory born and bred in the quagmires of
Marsh-dunce-land, that nothing is learning, unless it is disagreeable
, or worth having, unless it is difficult.  As if the value of
a building consisted in the number of the bricks which built it.
THRING-1883-2,179.280

Thus the high beauty of the Waverley novels, the winsome charm of ballads
, the music of lyric poetry, the glorious metrical romances of Scott,
the holy organ tones of immortal song, are not considered to be training
because they delight.  THRING-1883-2,179.281

But the world is large enough to tire the strongest.
THRING-1883-2,179.282

The more difficulties are removed, the farther the wayfarer can get.
THRING-1883-2,179.283

There is no fear that a too easy progress will ever do away with the
need of labour.  THRING-1883-2,179.284

The path wants to be smoothed not roughened.  THRING-1883-2,179.285

Would that a law could be passed, that no child should be taught
any language but its own, as a study, before ten years old.
THRING-1883-2,179.286

But then another law would have to be passed, that <P_180> no teacher
should teach, who could not make the pupils frame their own grammar
rules, by leading them to see that every necessity of grammar is but
common sense applied to words.  THRING-1883-2,180.287

And a third law would be wanted to manufacture a supply of such teachers
at once.  THRING-1883-2,180.288

Many other legislative feats would also be required before the possibility
of doing work so intelligent could begin.  THRING-1883-2,180.289

Here too, as in so many other cases, the finding easier ways of doing
work only means enabling a far higher standard to be reached in the
infinity of work to be done.  THRING-1883-2,180.290

Even if it were otherwise, there is no danger that the path shall be
all flowers, and the demand on work cease for many a year; and no danger
that an idle swallowing of pleasant surface literature, which is no more
sustenance than tartlets are beef, should take the place of honest food.
THRING-1883-2,180.291

The risks are all the other way; THRING-1883-2,180.292

either lumps of rules to be of use by and by, or a thin paring of
Manuals, is the diet with which the stomachs of the young are loaded.
THRING-1883-2,180.293

By all means let there be work.  THRING-1883-2,180.294

Careful selection of what has to be taken in and remembered is all that
is pleaded for.  THRING-1883-2,180.295

Neither is the fact lost sight of that there is a grand capacity in
the youthful memory of accumulating with little effort, mere sounds,
without understanding.  THRING-1883-2,180.296

This prescribes that the most useful drudgery should be got through early.
THRING-1883-2,180.297

And it may fairly be said, that <P_181> if under present circumstances
this was interpreted to mean that an absolutely infallible accuracy of
declensions and conjugations was acquired, years of after toil would be
saved, and in many instances lifelong incapacity be turned into healthy
activity of mind.  THRING-1883-2,181.298

No tongue can tell the hopeless state of muddle which is produced by
scrambling into the word-quagmire without a single bit of solid knowledge
to rest the sole of the foot on.  THRING-1883-2,181.299

Nature therefore in giving the young a youthful memory lays down its
own laws, if any one would heed them.  THRING-1883-2,181.300

First fill the great receptacle with everything that inspirits, and
interests, all treasures of melodious verse, all thrilling narrative
of daring deeds, all simple pathos of touching endurance, mingled with
the weird, wild truths of the wonders of the animal and physical world.
THRING-1883-2,181.301

And secondly, all drudgery necessary to be known, which is not better
learned in the practising it, word-forms, and everything belonging
to word-forms and their meaning, may well be stored up at once.
THRING-1883-2,181.302

But rules, and technical terms, should be avoided as much as possible.
THRING-1883-2,181.303

They pass for understanding without being understood;
THRING-1883-2,181.304

and not unfrequently are the cause of all the entanglement of after
years; when the stock names are answered to the stock questions;
THRING-1883-2,181.305

and oftentimes neither teacher nor learner have the least idea of the
real purport of the words they use so glibly.  THRING-1883-2,181.306

<P_182>

It is easy to learn books of rules, and never apply them.
THRING-1883-2,182.308

It is easy to answer them correctly and be quite ignorant why the answer
is correct.  THRING-1883-2,182.309

Rules are the refuge of the brainless; and the instrument of those who
have to produce some show without the time or machinery necessary for
true work.  THRING-1883-2,182.310

This is bad enough, THRING-1883-2,182.311

but there is worse behind.  THRING-1883-2,182.312

Bad repetition.  THRING-1883-2,182.313

Bad repetition is grown as a regular crop by a well-calculated system
of cultivation in many instances.  THRING-1883-2,182.314

Nothing is more common than the setting lessons too long to be thoroughly
learnt in the time allowed.  THRING-1883-2,182.315

This is worse than lost time.  THRING-1883-2,182.316

Experience shows that two different kinds of maimed power result from
this, each according to the kind of victim.  THRING-1883-2,182.317

The slow, clumsy learner settles down into a heavy persistency that
he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} learn, and that it is no use trying to
do so.  Which is indeed only too true as long as a dull, unhelping
hand above forces the yoke down on a dull, repugnant mind below.
THRING-1883-2,182.318

This process turns out the unbelievers in culture, the carnivorous stags.
THRING-1883-2,182.319

But the quick, clever wits acquire a fatal facility of quickly catching
up the task at the time, and forgetting it as quickly, to the permanent
injury of steady, retentive grasp.  THRING-1883-2,182.320

But there is worse still behind.  THRING-1883-2,182.321

Many operators allow nonsense to be repeated; THRING-1883-2,182.322

in other words, they first permit the pupil to neglect the great fact
that <P_183> the sense is the strongest hook to fasten the words on to the
mind, and also the only thing worth fastening on; THRING-1883-2,183.323

and secondly, let him go off with innumerable errors fixed in his mind
instead of knowledge, as far as anything is fixed.  THRING-1883-2,183.324

Inaccuracy in fact is taught as a lesson.  THRING-1883-2,183.325

How few apparently have any idea of instructing their pupils how to learn.
THRING-1883-2,183.326

The metre is neglected.  THRING-1883-2,183.327

In other words, that rhythmical measure, which makes the melody of
poetry, and causes it to be easier to learn than prose, is allowed to
go for nothing.  THRING-1883-2,183.328

Here again not mere forgetfulness is the evil, THRING-1883-2,183.329

but inaccuracy is taught as a lesson.  THRING-1883-2,183.330

Then even the correct words are mumbled in such a fashion that it matters
little whether they are correct or not; THRING-1883-2,183.331

all the life is gone out of them.  THRING-1883-2,183.332

Indifference is taught as a lesson.  THRING-1883-2,183.333

Yet these points are points of teaching, THRING-1883-2,183.334

and belong to a teacher.  THRING-1883-2,183.335

Forgetfulness would be a light evil; THRING-1883-2,183.336

but unmetrical, slipshod nonsense, full of words mangled, mispronounced ,
ungrammatical, mere dead lumps, shapeless, and vile, all this is poured
into the memory, to reappear again, and again, any number of times, in
idiotic mistakes, and to form a ruinous habit of never having accurate
knowledge in anything.  THRING-1883-2,183.337

No!  forgetfulness is a blessing, when inaccuracy is taught as a lesson.
THRING-1883-2,183.338

Happy would many teachers be, if the pupils they receive did forget.
THRING-1883-2,183.339

Forgetfulness is a blessing when inaccuracy <P_184> is taught as
a lesson, as it must be when too much is required to be learnt.
THRING-1883-2,184.340

The last point of those mentioned as belonging to the minds to be dealt
with is the demand for thoroughness.  THRING-1883-2,184.341

This properly falls under the main head of the powers of reasoning,
and how far they are to be found in the young; THRING-1883-2,184.342

but is so pretentious, and so frequently put forward, that a
little special notice given to it will not be out of place.
THRING-1883-2,184.343

There is something so wise, so unanswerable, in the modest, yet firm
requirement that the lessons must be done thoroughly, and a boy not
advance till he has mastered what he is doing, that the request commands
assent at once; THRING-1883-2,184.344

there is also so real a truth underlying the dictum that the fallacy
involved in it easily escapes notice.  THRING-1883-2,184.345

The fallacy is, - it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be done.
THRING-1883-2,184.346

There is no power in the minds of the young to master a subject
thoroughly.  THRING-1883-2,184.347

Thorough mastery is the perfection of trained skill, THRING-1883-2,184.348

and it is absurd to demand the perfection of trained skill from the
untrained beginner.  THRING-1883-2,184.349

The map-work which transfers to the mind a complete plan of the country
belongs to men; THRING-1883-2,184.350

it is enough, and more than enough, if the boy can find his way about
fairly well, and appreciate the landscape.  THRING-1883-2,184.351

Any attempt to linger too long over the same work will only end in
weariness, and deadening the interest.  THRING-1883-2,184.352

Words and work, when stale, become to the young mere empty sounds,
<P_185> meaningless rote-work.  THRING-1883-2,185.353

There must be change.  THRING-1883-2,185.354

Looseness indeed is fatal.  THRING-1883-2,185.355

What is known ought to be known with exactness; THRING-1883-2,185.356

but a gap is no harm, unless it is in the middle of the main highway.
THRING-1883-2,185.357

Monotony is the greatest enemy a teacher has to deal with.
THRING-1883-2,185.358

There is much danger, where all is new, as it is with beginners, lest
a boy find a dead level without landmarks to guide.  THRING-1883-2,185.359

Where all is new, all $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be mastered,
THRING-1883-2,185.360

and in the first confusion, unless he moves on, there is nothing to show
what is intended to be done, or where he is to go.  THRING-1883-2,185.361

This perplexity is much increased very often by indiscriminate
fault-finding, which instead of marking a distinct narrow path through the
thicket, mixes up great and little, stumbling in the way, and wandering
off the way, errors of ignorance, and errors of laziness , non-work and
bad work, mental peccadilloes, and mental crimes, in one inextricable
tangle from which there is no escape, because there is no clear idea
whatever given to the boy mind of anything.  Whereas though thoroughness
is impossible, and there is far too much novelty to be mapped out, there
is no impossibility whatever in marking , pioneer fashion, a track on
which a boy shall feel perfectly safe.  THRING-1883-2,185.362

This feeling of perfect safety is the one thing no bad teacher dreams
of giving, and which every good teacher makes it the first business of
his life to try to impart.  THRING-1883-2,185.363

Again, <P_186> many difficulties in learning $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be mastered by standing still over them; THRING-1883-2,186.364

they can only be got rid of by movement.  THRING-1883-2,186.365

They are like what happens to the traveller.  THRING-1883-2,186.366

In the valley, on the low ground, the fog reigns, THRING-1883-2,186.367

and as long as the traveller stops in the valley, will continue to reign,
not to be wrestled with, or overcome; THRING-1883-2,186.368

but let him move up, and move up, THRING-1883-2,186.369

and by degrees mere movement brings him into a clearer atmosphere,
THRING-1883-2,186.370

the mist vanishes away, THRING-1883-2,186.371

and at the top of the hill the whole great landscape in all its beauty
is clear, THRING-1883-2,186.372

and the little hollows with their fog are mere specks, even if they
still are there.  THRING-1883-2,186.373

So it is with the boy mind, THRING-1883-2,186.374

never let it stay too long in the hollows.  THRING-1883-2,186.375

Movement is absolutely necessary, THRING-1883-2,186.376

at the same time the back work ought to be incessantly kept up by
a small portion of time being devoted weekly to foundation work.
THRING-1883-2,186.377

And the teachers throughout a School ought to have an Index Expurgatorius
of faults to be stamped out; each class keeping in communication with
the one above, and below it, so as to waste no labour, and to be aware
what the idler boys ought to know.  THRING-1883-2,186.378

Extreme accuracy in the structure of common sentences, and the forms of
common words, ought to be universal.  THRING-1883-2,186.379

No good teacher allows any shortcoming here.  THRING-1883-2,186.380

But thoroughness in the ordinary sense of the word is impossible by the
laws of nature.  THRING-1883-2,186.381

The actual teaching comes next.  THRING-1883-2,187.392

No words can exaggerate the importance of the first rule to be laid down.
THRING-1883-2,187.393

The observance of it would revolutionise the whole world of tuition.
THRING-1883-2,187.394

It is so simple that it can be observed.  So simple, that few observe
it.  So simple, that those who want talk, and will do anything, and
undergo anything rather than think, and act, will scorn to observe it.
THRING-1883-2,187.395

Many boys, who all their lives long know nothing because of early tangle ,
would know.  THRING-1883-2,187.396

All would save half their time.  THRING-1883-2,187.397

What then is this talisman, this Columbus's egg, this simple magic
and magic simplicity, this <P_188> Aladdin's lamp, which is to
whisk everything into place, and create half a lifetime for all?
THRING-1883-2,188.398

- Articulation.  THRING-1883-2,188.399

- Nothing more than a rigid, absolute unfailing exacting of articulate
speech, and the pronouncing the final syllable of each word firmly,
distinctly, and unmistakeably.  THRING-1883-2,188.400

The full force of this statement is not seen at once.
THRING-1883-2,188.401

It has been proved that accuracy is the first, and main object of
training, both the power of accurate observation, and the power of
reproducing accurately what has been observed.  THRING-1883-2,188.402

It has been proved also that one of the main advantages of an unspoken
language as an instrument of training consists in the number of
inflected forms, the changes, that is, in the final syllables.
THRING-1883-2,188.403

The orderly multitude of small word-labels, all calling for intelligent
observation, is that property of language which makes language in
the first instance such a valuable drill-master, apart from any other
consideration.  THRING-1883-2,188.404

Every one has seen an imperfect chromograph.  THRING-1883-2,188.405

Let us suppose for a moment a chromograph of a book in which every final
syllable was left out, or blurred, and this too in a foreign language.
THRING-1883-2,188.406

What would be the value of that copy to a learner with its pages full
of words cut in half?  THRING-1883-2,188.407

Precisely the same value, that inarticulately spoken lessons are to the
miserable victim, who is permitted to drop, or blur his final syllables.
THRING-1883-2,188.408

Add to <P_189> this that the human chromograph possesses the unenviable
faculty of filling in all the blurred or dropped portions incorrectly
at will, and so of keeping and cherishing not a merciful blank, but a
most cruel torment of endless mistakes.  THRING-1883-2,189.409

And all this ruinous downward training is the necessary result
of inarticulate speech, and the not sounding the final syllables.
THRING-1883-2,189.410

A habit is formed of confusion and indecision.  THRING-1883-2,189.411

Confusion and indecision breed constant disappointment, in a hard-working
boy especially; THRING-1883-2,189.412

inaccuracy in time settles down into a conviction that nothing is certain
or fixed, or, at least, that he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} by any possibility
arrive at it.  THRING-1883-2,189.413

And this in later life leads to all those sloppy theories and careless
confident judgments which fill the air; THRING-1883-2,189.414

and finally ends in utter and general unbelief in any one being really
master of his subject; with the fitting corollary, that if no one is
master of his subject, any one is at liberty to express his own views
on it; and the judgment of the skilled workman is of no more account
than the babble of the after-dinner talker.  THRING-1883-2,189.415

Nothing is a more striking sign of the rotten state of education than
the absolute non-existence of any respect for the judgment of the skilled
workman in his own line, whatever that line may be.  THRING-1883-2,189.416

Only lawyers are exempt from this irony of being handled by the amateur!
THRING-1883-2,189.417

The evil of inarticulate speech has much <P_190> to do with this
, by destroying in the great majority the sense of precision.
THRING-1883-2,190.418

But to return to the learner at his task.  THRING-1883-2,190.419

The pupil in language might be defined in his early stages as one
whose business it is to stamp on his memory the last syllable of words.
THRING-1883-2,190.420

Therefore he is allowed never to pronounce one of them distinctly.
THRING-1883-2,190.421

The blurred chromograph sprawls over his whole mental tablet, with an
ever increasing family of mistakes, till at last in hopeless bewilderment
he dubs himself utterly stupid, gives up the struggle and leaves off
trying to get on, accusing his poor calumniated mind, when all the time
the only culprit is his tongue, and the teacher, who has not taught him
how to use his tongue properly.  THRING-1883-2,190.422

If articulate speech is really taught, and the accurate attention
necessary for articulate speech is the habit of the room, then the next
step is natural and easy.  THRING-1883-2,190.423

Accuracy demands that the right thing should be known, and, if known,
said at once.  THRING-1883-2,190.424

Therefore - never allow a boy to correct himself.  That is, inflict
at once whatever penalty the mistake carries with it without fail,
THRING-1883-2,190.425

and then, and not till then, make the offender mend his ways.
THRING-1883-2,190.426

Or, at least, impose silence until your questions have exposed the
blunder.  THRING-1883-2,190.427

There is a vast army of mistakes, which are no mistakes at all in the
sense of being wrong mistaken for right.  THRING-1883-2,190.428

They <P_191> are merely the loose snores of the unwaked mind; when the
construer, or answerer, knows perfectly well, as well as his master
does, the actual bit of knowledge to be produced, but has been permitted
again, and again, to spit out what came uppermost, and - to correct it.
THRING-1883-2,191.429

He has not made an intelligent mistake, THRING-1883-2,191.430

he has not even made an idle, unintelligent mistake, THRING-1883-2,191.431

he has simply snored, emitted an unthought of sound out of a drowsy
cavern of non-life.  THRING-1883-2,191.432

It is no mistake at all; as he proves the next moment, and very often will
admit, by correcting it promptly and with ease.  THRING-1883-2,191.433

No correction ought ever to be allowed to avert blame, or penalty.
THRING-1883-2,191.434

This rule does not interfere with that most useful of all minor
inflictions, the pushing an idle, careless boy through the bit he is
maltreating, forcing him to flounder on, to sprawl about, to take every
word, and render each, as he takes them, however absurdly, in all the
hideous deformity of words unknown, grammar defied, and sense nowhere; and
then when he has finished, reading out the result.  THRING-1883-2,191.435

There is no worse fault in teacher or taught than not keeping close to
the work, and working with certainty.  THRING-1883-2,191.436

Real mistakes are one thing.  THRING-1883-2,191.437

Sham mistakes are another.  THRING-1883-2,191.438

And the learners ought to have the distinction sharply and strongly cut
across their minds.  THRING-1883-2,191.439

A boy ought to be made to see always that what he <font> can <$$font>
do he <font> shall <$$font> <P_192> do.  THRING-1883-2,192.440

Faults of ignorance are very real, THRING-1883-2,192.441

and faults of idleness are very real, THRING-1883-2,192.442

but at any given moment there may be great difficulty, nay, impossibility,
of judging whether any blame or punishment is deserved by the guilty,
but unfortunate creature, who has made them.  THRING-1883-2,192.443

But sham mistakes admit of no such doubt; THRING-1883-2,192.444

they are unpardonable; THRING-1883-2,192.445

and if every teacher agreed in never allowing this preventible crime;
never allowing a correction; never allowing these senseless snores to
pass; a great revolution would be effected.  THRING-1883-2,192.446

It is not the knowledge of the miserable Tense, or Case, that is the
question, but the slackness of mind that is so deadly, the trained
activity that is at stake.  THRING-1883-2,192.447

Sham mistakes should be exterminated promptly.  THRING-1883-2,192.448

They are mere vacuity, total absence of training and thought.
THRING-1883-2,192.449

There are many varieties of the sham mistake.  THRING-1883-2,192.450

Guessing pure and simple is akin to this absence of thought.
THRING-1883-2,192.451

The snorer and the guesser are twins.  THRING-1883-2,192.452

"Both thrive under bad teaching. "THRING-1883-2,192.453

"Common mistakes,"writes one,"are those due to wild guessing.
THRING-1883-2,192.454

A boy takes a shot, as the question goes by, on the chance of getting up.
THRING-1883-2,192.455

Hence a verb may have twenty different Perfects and Supines given it as
it goes down the class. "THRING-1883-2,192.456

What a graphic picture!  THRING-1883-2,192.457

Twenty boys with necks outstretched, eagerly gasping at their chances
of making mistakes - in order to be promoted, THRING-1883-2,192.458

and - <P_193> the serene power in the clouds above permitting it.
THRING-1883-2,193.459

This is only too faithful a sketch of what is done, and ought not to
be done.  THRING-1883-2,193.460

The artist has depicted with fidelity, from the life, the native
simplicity of English teaching.  THRING-1883-2,193.461

But the guesser can easily be brought to book.  THRING-1883-2,193.462

Let him be told to look steadily at the questioner, and be asked,
what boy, or tree, or picture, or whatever may be there, inside or
outside the room, is behind his back; and be bantered when he $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} tell, and be bid guess, and laughed at for not guessing
, and when he has been made sufficiently uncomfortable, be shown how
utterly idiotic it is to make a guess at what he knows nothing about,
with the range of the whole world for his guesses to disport in, when
he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} even guess what is close to him, and one of
the few things that can be near him.  THRING-1883-2,193.463

Next there is a distinct class of sham mistakes which may be called
lunatic mistakes.  THRING-1883-2,193.464

The following dialogue will explain what is meant.  THRING-1883-2,193.465

A bit of stray nonsense is turned loose by a boy.  THRING-1883-2,193.466

<font> Master.  <$$font> Are you deaf?  THRING-1883-2,193.467

<font> Boy.  <$$font> No.  THRING-1883-2,193.468

<font> B. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think so.
THRING-1883-2,193.472

<font> M. <$$font> Just imagine then that we two are out <P_194>
walking, and meet a dog.  THRING-1883-2,194.473

I say"look at that calf. "THRING-1883-2,194.474

What do you do?  THRING-1883-2,194.475

<font> B. <$$font> Say $it $'s {TEXT:it's} a dog, it $is $n't
{TEXT:isn't} a calf.  THRING-1883-2,194.476

<font> M. <$$font> What!  contradict the Headmaster?
THRING-1883-2,194.477

<font> B. <$$font> A $dog $'s {TEXT:dog's} a dog.
THRING-1883-2,194.478

I must, because it is a dog.  THRING-1883-2,194.479

<font> M. <$$font> What!  venture to know better than the
Headmaster?  THRING-1883-2,194.480

<font> B. <$$font> I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help it.
THRING-1883-2,194.481

It is a dog.  THRING-1883-2,194.482

<font> M. <$$font> Well.  To take another case, say 2 x 2 = 5.
THRING-1883-2,194.483

<font> B. <$$font> But it $does $n't {TEXT:doesn't}.
THRING-1883-2,194.484

<font> M. <$$font> What!  contradicting again?
THRING-1883-2,194.485

<font> B. <$$font> Yes, of course, I must.  THRING-1883-2,194.486

<font> M. <$$font> Suppose I persist in saying it is 5?
THRING-1883-2,194.487

<font> B. <$$font> You would be mad.  THRING-1883-2,194.488

<font> M. <$$font> What!  you able to judge that I was mad?
THRING-1883-2,194.489

<font> B. <$$font> Why!  yes.  THRING-1883-2,194.490

<font> M. <$$font> Well, $let $'s {TEXT:let's} move on.
THRING-1883-2,194.491

Genitor is the genitive case.  THRING-1883-2,194.492

<font> B. <$$font> But it $is $n't {TEXT:isn't}.
THRING-1883-2,194.493

<font> M. <$$font> Contradicting the Headmaster again?
THRING-1883-2,194.494

<font> B. <$$font> I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} help it.
THRING-1883-2,194.495

<font> M. <$$font> Well then, 2 x 2 = 5 and Genitor the Genitive
case are as much signs of madness in me and you as calling a dog a calf?
THRING-1883-2,194.496

<font> B. <$$font> Yes, certainly they are.  THRING-1883-2,194.497

<font> M. <$$font> All I can say is we have made a most interesting
discovery this morning.  THRING-1883-2,194.498

This is a most <P_195> flourishing Lunatic Asylum.  THRING-1883-2,195.499

Not a day passes in which dogs and calves are not jumbled in beautiful
confusion and perfect indifference as to which, by you and your
companions.  THRING-1883-2,195.500

Many of these things you know quite as well as I do, if you would but
stick to what you know.  THRING-1883-2,195.501

It is not true that you are ignorant.  THRING-1883-2,195.502

You have already a considerable amount of real, solid knowledge under
your feet, on which you can stand firmly, and advance firmly, without
sticking in the mud, or tumbling into ditches!  THRING-1883-2,195.503
