Wednesday 1 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.2

<paren> Writing the 14.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,47.3

Rose early; BOSWELL-1783-2,47.4

a fine frosty morning.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.5

Left Coilsfield with youthful ideas of that social family,
BOSWELL-1783-2,47.6

and rode briskly to Rozelle.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.7

Found there Lord Crawford, whom I had not seen for seven years, and his
brother Bourtreehill.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.8

Talked of going home after breakfast.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.9

But the Countess and Lady Mary asked me to stay in so obliging a manner
that I passed all New Year's Day there, BOSWELL-1783-2,47.10

and was really happy; BOSWELL-1783-2,47.11

only when alone with the Countess, was hurt by perceiving her distress
on account of her son Bute, who, it was feared, was lost in the <font>
Centaur.  <$$font> BOSWELL-1783-2,47.12

Was sober and just as I could wish.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.13

Knockroon and Bailie Neill were both with me about business, of which
I found myself sufficiently capable.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.14

Thursday 2 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.15

<paren> Writing the 14.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,47.16

Rode home to breakfast; BOSWELL-1783-2,47.17

still a fine frost.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.18

Had James Bruce along with me, while I <paren> writing 15 January
<$$paren> took a note of trees round my farmyards, marking what were to
grow and what to be cut.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.19

This amused me much.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.20

I this day finished my survey of them in that part of the barony which
lies to the south of the <font> via sacra <$$font>, as my father used
to call the kirk road.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.21

I then sat as preses of a meeting of heritors and farmers in the church
which had been very properly called by Mr. Dun to consider
of securing meal for the people, particularly of the village, as an
apprehension had been taken that it would be carried out of the parish
and sold at a distance.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.22

He suggested that each of us, according to our stock of it, should engage
to have a certain number of bolls kept to be sold at the market price,
which was then 15 <font> d. <$$font> BOSWELL-1783-2,47.23

I subscribed for forty bolls; BOSWELL-1783-2,47.24

and the subscription in all amounted to above eighty.
BOSWELL-1783-2,47.25

I had three bolls ready at Brigend Mill, which I ordered to be sold out
directly at 14 <font> d.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.26

, <$$font> but declaring publicly that this was not to be any rule to
the farmers, who were to have the market price.  BOSWELL-1783-2,47.27

There was something comfortable in <P_48> thus quieting the minds of
the people.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.28

I then rouped my farm of Dernlaw for a year in grass, at Lapraik's,
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.29

and got within a few pounds of the rent paid for it in the ordinary
state of a farm.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.30

Then the Laird of Logan, Old Mr. John Boswell, some others,
and myself dined at Mr. Dun's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.31

After tea Mr. Halbert, the session-clerk, came BOSWELL-1783-2,48.32

and I revised his register.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.33

Then I walked home, accompanied by Mr. Millar; BOSWELL-1783-2,48.34

and the evening was concluded as usual most decently with family worship
and a sober supper.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.35

Friday 3 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.36

<paren> Writing the 15.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,48.37

Mounted early, BOSWELL-1783-2,48.38

rode to Fairlie; BOSWELL-1783-2,48.39

the Laird not at home.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.40

Went on to Eglinton, where he was, and where I was to dine.
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.41

Reached it about ten - excellent alertness.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.42

Found Fairlie, Captain Peebles, and Williamwood, whom I had never
seen before.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.43

I liked him much.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.44

The Baron of Lochrig also appeared.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.45

Captain John Fergusson arrived BOSWELL-1783-2,48.46

and paid a forenoon visit.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.47

The Earl made his appearance about noon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.48

He and I and Fairlie walked near to Irvine.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.49

His Lordship was very glad to see me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.50

I had a plain conversation with him on the politics of the county.
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.51

I told him he might depend upon my assistance in <paren> writing 19
January <$$paren> his interest, BOSWELL-1783-2,48.52

and I desired to know if he was again to set up Col. Hugh
Montgomerie.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.53

He said the Colonel was to stand.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.54

He said he was much obliged to me, BOSWELL-1783-2,48.55

and he really seemed to be keen.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.56

I told him that though his Lordship were not to support my friend
Hugh, I would stand by him if he had but a wish for being Member.
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.57

But in case of his not choosing it, I intended to offer myself.
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.58

I told the Earl that since I had the influenza last summer I really
was not able to drink; and if it was disagreeable to him that a man
should sit by him without drinking, I would take my horse and go away.
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.59

He said I should do just as I pleased.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.60

I paid a visit before dinner to my old acquaintance, Mrs. Reid
the housekeeper.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.61

At dinner there was quite a comfortable company; just the Earl, the
Laird of Fairlie, the Baron of Lochrig, and Knockroon and myself;
BOSWELL-1783-2,48.62

neither grandees, nor numbers to make his Lordship hold himself up
in state.  BOSWELL-1783-2,48.63

He was quite cheerful and easy, BOSWELL-1783-2,48.64

and at my request sung <font> Sheriffmuir, <$$font>"Coming through the
broom,"and"Row me o'er the lea-rig. "BOSWELL-1783-2,48.65

I had some old <P_49> Malaga; BOSWELL-1783-2,49.66

and finding I really had liberty to drink as I pleased, my heart dilated
, BOSWELL-1783-2,49.67

and I drank two bottles all but three glasses.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.68

We then played <font> vingt-et-un <$$font> till supper, at which I did
my part decently enough; BOSWELL-1783-2,49.69

but being sleepy with my potion, went to bed as soon as the cloth was
taken away.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.70

Saturday 4 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.71

<paren> Writing the 19.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,49.72

Awaked very ill, BOSWELL-1783-2,49.73

and was somewhat vexed that I had not been able to maintain my sobriety
even at Eglinton.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.74

It was a wet morning.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.75

Fairlie and Knockroon went away before I got up.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.76

I had some tea, BOSWELL-1783-2,49.77

and then followed them to Fairlie, where I breakfasted;
BOSWELL-1783-2,49.78

then went to Riccarton to a meeting of the tutors and curators of
Treesbanks; BOSWELL-1783-2,49.79

dined at Mr. Bruce Campbell's, BOSWELL-1783-2,49.80

and then went to Loudoun, where I found the excellent Earl, and the
Laird of Dunlop and the Major with him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.81

Was comfortable here, and much pleased to see little Lady Flora, a fine,
healthful child.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.82

Miss Bell MacLeod and Mrs. Vernon were here.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.83

After tea I played whist, BOSWELL-1783-2,49.84

and after supper drank very little.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.85

Was glad to find no continuation of a drinking disposition.
BOSWELL-1783-2,49.86

Thought I should be often at this good Place, where I was truly happy.
BOSWELL-1783-2,49.87

Sunday 5 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,49.88

<paren> Writing the 19.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,49.89

Being resolved to appear at my own parish church, I had chocolade early
BOSWELL-1783-2,49.90

and set out in good <P_50> time; BOSWELL-1783-2,50.91

a fine morning.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.92

Called on Mr. Auld at Mauchline BOSWELL-1783-2,50.93

and engaged him to be with me at four o'clock.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.94

Alighted when I had passed the Howford bridge, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.95

and having ordered my horses home, walked to Willockstown, which I had
never seen, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.96

and conversed with William Murdoch, the tenant, whom I found to be a
sensible, candid man.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.97

Then went by the Tenshillingside BOSWELL-1783-2,50.98

and visited old John Colville, whom I had placed in a good house there
in his eighty-ninth year.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.99

He was lying in bed BOSWELL-1783-2,50.100

and conversed very distinctly, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.101

and told me it was the best house he had ever been in.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.102

I also looked in upon Quintin Dun, who was not well.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.103

My heart was calmly benevolent.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.104

I went by the turnpike and the Old House, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.105

and was happy as in my early years, with the addition of the loftiness
of being Laird.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.106

I called on James Bruce, who walked so far with me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.107

Then had breakfast, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.108

shifted, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.109

and was made happy with an agreeable letter from my dear wife.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.110

Then took fresh horses <paren> old Browning for myself <$$paren>
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.111

and rode to church.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.112

Mr. Millar preached.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.113

Had a cordial short conversation with Mr. Dun;
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.114

and Mr. John Boswell, Senior, and Mr. Millar rode home
with me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.115

Mr. Auld arrived; BOSWELL-1783-2,50.116

and we passed the evening in most decent and agreeable sociality, quite
in the style of the family.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.117

Mr. Auld said prayers, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.118

and mentioned those of this family in former generations.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.119

I was just as I wished to be.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.120

I was quite satisfied with my character and conduct at present.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.121

It was what would have pleased my father and my grandfather.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.122

May I ever behave in like manner at the seat of my ancestors!
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.123

Monday 6 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.124

<paren> Writing the 19.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,50.125

Let me write shorter.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.126

I had received so polite a card from Lord Dumfries, I wished to breakfast
with him today.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.127

But so many of my tenants came about me, I did not get away till about
eleven.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.128

I paid him and the Countess a short visit; BOSWELL-1783-2,50.129

then called on Mr. George Reid, whom I must see every time I am
in the country; BOSWELL-1783-2,50.130

then rode to Ayr BOSWELL-1783-2,50.131

and dined at Knockroon's with Dr. Campbell.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.132

Visited Lady Cunninghame; BOSWELL-1783-2,50.133

drank tea with John Webster.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.134

Met on business with Garallan and Mr. James Fergusson.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.135

Then went to Lady Crawford's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.136

But found she had received sad accounts of her son Bute being lost,
and was confined to her room.  BOSWELL-1783-2,50.137

Would not go in to Lord Crawford, etc., who were there,
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.138

but went back to Ayr quite dreary, BOSWELL-1783-2,50.139

and resolved to sit all night by myself till bedtime.
BOSWELL-1783-2,50.140

Next morning <P_51> early Dr. Campbell was to go with me by
Straiton to Craigengillan's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.141

I tried a bottle of perry, which put some spirit into me;
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.142

then sat an hour with Lady Cunninghame, who had Miss Whitefoord of
Dunduff with her.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.143

Was a little relieved.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.144

But returned to the King's Arms to indulge melancholy.
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.145

Luckily for me, Knockroon joined me, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.146

and his contentment, and saying our own distresses were enough for us
, and some good veal cutlets and warm port with spice, made me very
comfortable.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.147

Unnecessary sadness is irrational.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.148

My melancholy could do Lady Crawford no good.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.149

She did not see me, to be soothed by it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.150

Tuesday 7 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.151

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,51.152

It was a rainy morning.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.153

But Dr. Campbell and I rode briskly along.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.154

It soon faired, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.155

and I had a most agreeable ride with him, quite new to me after
we passed Dalrymple bridge, up the Water of Girvan by Glencaird.
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.156

One purpose I had this morning was to view Sir John Whitefoord's old
family seat, Blairquhan.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.157

I was much pleased with my ride, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.158

and the ancient house and large plane - and ash-trees at this Place
delighted my ancient baron soul.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.159

We breakfasted at Straiton, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.160

and I viewed the church and churchyard, which is uncommonly spacious
and has several old trees in it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.161

Got to Berboth to dinner, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.162

Craigengillan huzzaed when he saw me, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.163

and I returned the jovial shout.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.164

The day passed heartily, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.165

and I had the happiness to be assured that his beautiful daughter
should go with me to Auchinleck, as I was to conduct her to our house
at Edinburgh.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.166

Wednesday 8 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.167

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,51.168

Dr. Campbell went away betimes.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.169

I passed the forenoon in taking down from Craigengillan's dictating
a number of particulars of his life, which for good sense, activity,
and prosperity is truly remarkable.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.170

I had formerly taken down some anecdotes of it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.171

Captain McAdam came before dinner.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.172

The day passed as heartily as yesterday.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.173

I was in sound, cheerful spirits, just as I could wish to be.
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.174

Thursday 9 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.175

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,51.176

A terrible morning; wind, hail, thunder, and lightning.
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.177

It grew better, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.178

and I set out with Miss McAdam on horseback through the moors.
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.179

Captain McAdam went with us till the road to New Cumnock struck off.
BOSWELL-1783-2,51.180

Wind and rain came on, BOSWELL-1783-2,51.181

and we were wet to the skin.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.182

Craigengillan's servant Gilbert, a Cumnock man, was so excellent a guide
that there seemed no difficulty in the moor road.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.183

I sent forward William Lennox.  BOSWELL-1783-2,51.184

We passed through <P_52> Lord Dumfries's Place to have a short road,
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.185

and when we got to Auchinleck, things were pretty comfortable, so that my
beautiful charge and I passed the afternoon and evening very agreeably.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.186

I was vain of such a trust.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.187

I recollect this as one of the most pleasing days of my life: the
certainty of being undisturbed by company; looking at books, medals,
etc., with a sweet creature; in short a group of good ideas.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.188

She told me since she had also such a recollection.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.189

Friday 1O January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.190

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.191

After an early breakfast, had a chaise from Cumnock which drove us there.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.192

I was detained by several of my tenants a good while.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.193

We then had all the fly secured, BOSWELL-1783-2,52.194

and after a very good journey got to my house in Edinburgh about eleven
at night.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.195

It was comfortable to me to be with my wife and children again.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.196

Saturday 11 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.197

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.198

The day passed I know not well how.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.199

Grange and several of our young friends dined with us.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.200

Sunday 12 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.201

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.202

At home in the forenoon waiting till it should fair, that I might go to
Duddingston; BOSWELL-1783-2,52.203

but the rain continued.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.204

Heard Dr. Blair in the afternoon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.205

Paid a visit to Lady Auchinleck.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.206

Supped at Dr. Webster's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.207

Nobody there but old Mr. John McLure.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.208

Monday 13 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.209

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.210

Dr. Webster and I dined at Lady Dundonald's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.211

Mr. Callender from Quebec there, who talked a great deal, and
gave us very distinct information about Canada.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.212

Dr. Webster and Grange supped with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.213

Tuesday 14 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.214

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.215

Dr. Webster and I dined at Commissioner Cochrane's, where we
again met Mr. Callender, as also his father, Mr. Callender,
Clerk of Session.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.216

The Commissioner's gentlemanly good sense pleased me.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.217

But I was sorry to think he was so old, BOSWELL-1783-2,52.218

and when he shivered a little, he said it was a coldness before death.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.219

Wednesday 15 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.220

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.221

Grange dined with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.222

I began to have a little return of bad spirits.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.223

Thursday 16 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.224

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,52.225

After making my appearance in the Court of Session, where I had nothing
to do today, I went to Lady Colville's BOSWELL-1783-2,52.226

and took a second breakfast, Lord Kellie, who was come from Fife, having
called on me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.227

My spirits were pretty good.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.228

But the enamel of my sound mind was a little broken.
BOSWELL-1783-2,52.229

I paid a visit at Mr. Wellwood's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.230

Missed Sir Charles Preston and Miss Preston.  BOSWELL-1783-2,52.231

Visited <P_53> Colonel Montgomerie.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.232

Wrote a part of <font> The Hypochondriack <$$font> No. 64.
BOSWELL-1783-2,53.233

Dined at Mr. George Wallace's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.234

Not as I could wish.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.235

Friday 17 January.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.236

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,53.237

Finished, I think, No. 64.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.238

The Court of Session was irksome to me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.239

Old Mar came to me in the afternoon BOSWELL-1783-2,53.240

and absurdly opposed my writing Dr. Johnson's life, against whom
he had the most ignorant Scotch prejudice.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.241

He and the Rev. James Cochrane drank tea with us.
BOSWELL-1783-2,53.242

I waited by invitation on Mrs. Drummond, who was anxious about
my scheme of writing her husband's life, which I however resolved should
not be done in a hurry.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.243

I could not sup with her, as I was busy with law.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.244

There was a dreariness in the thought that Lord Kames was gone, while
I sat in his house.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.245

Miss McAdam is so sweet and amiable a part of our family that I $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} sufficiently express my happiness at having her with us.
BOSWELL-1783-2,53.246

My wife is now in as good health and looks as I ever saw her.
BOSWELL-1783-2,53.247

Poor little James is miserably distressed with a scorbutic disorder,
BOSWELL-1783-2,53.248

but Mr. Wood declares it not dangerous.  BOSWELL-1783-2,53.249

Looked into books in the Advocates'Library for a motto to <font> The
Hypochondriack <$$font> No. 65.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.507

Found one on time in Josephus.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.508

Put down some hints, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.509

but was indifferent whether I should write well or ill.
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.510

Went with the Hon. Alexander Gordon and Grange to Hall's Cellar,
near Nicolson Street, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.511

and tasted some claret.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.512

Was in a dissipated frame.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.513

Grange dined with me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.514

In the evening I was quite in the humour of London life,
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.515

and wished to go to Princes Street Coffee-house and sup.
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.516

But was persuaded to stay at home, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.517

and indulged myself with a broiled bone and some rum punch, which I
seldom choose.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.518

I was hearty at home.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.519

Sunday 16 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.520

<paren> Writing the 19.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,60.521

Was at the New Church all day, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.522

and felt a satisfaction in decent regularity.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.523

Heard Mr. Hardy at Ballingry lecture well in the forenoon and
Mr. Walker preach as usual in the afternoon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.524

Visited the Hon. Alexander Gordon between sermons.
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.525

Then he called BOSWELL-1783-2,60.526

and eat a bit of veal with us; BOSWELL-1783-2,60.527

Mr. Grant of Monymusk at dinner.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.528

At Gordon's pressing request I went to him in the afternoon, after
hearing my children say divine lessons, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.529

and tasted different kinds of claret, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.530

and then drank tea with him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.531

Tasting heated me a little BOSWELL-1783-2,60.532

and made me wish if possible to be a pure water-drinker.
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.533

Sir Charles and Colonel Preston, Mr. William Nairne, Hon.
Alexander Gordon, and Hon. Andrew Cochrane supped with us;
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.534

a good cheerful evening.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.535

Monday 17 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.536

<paren> Writing the 19.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,60.537

Had a visit of Colonel Montgomerie.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.538

Was in poor spirits, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.539

but wrote an <font> Hypochondriack <$$font> with curious ingenuity
of thinking.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.540

I wrote chiefly to please myself, and with a view to make out a couple
of proper volumes of that periodical paper; BOSWELL-1783-2,60.541

for my partners of the <font> London Magazine <$$font> did not relish
it much.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.542

I was not in the least affected by this, because I had no opinion of
their taste in writing, BOSWELL-1783-2,60.543

for they wished rather for a <font> merry essay.  <$$font>
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.544

I wrote to Dilly that I wished to continue it to No. 70, the
years of man's life.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.545

But if the partners really thought they could find a variety of materials
all better, I should close it next month.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.546

It is wonderful how the spur of engagement makes me write.

Tuesday 18 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.548

<paren> Writing the 19.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,60.549

Was rather better, but quite dissatisfied with the narrow sphere here,
and perpetually languishing for London eminence.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.550

Dined at Commissioner Cochrane's; BOSWELL-1783-2,60.551

Dr. Webster there.  BOSWELL-1783-2,60.552

They both approved much of my continuing to apply to business as a lawyer.
BOSWELL-1783-2,60.553

My mind however was so clouded and so broken that I could not feel with
clearness and strength the distinction <P_61> between doing well and
doing ill in this uncertain and short life.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.554

Strange that one should think so differently at different times.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.555

For upon some occasions I am quite animated with good ambition.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.556

I however this day wrote an able Petition for Garallan in support of
a Decreet Arbitral which a majority of the Lords had very erroneously
reduced.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.557

I was pleased with my own powers, while I at the same time did not
<font> feel <$$font> that it was of much consequence to have talents.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.558

Such was the state of my mind.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.559

Wednesday 19 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.560

<paren> Writing the 20.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,61.561

Felt all at once in the Court of Session a happy state of mind which made
me view it with complacency instead of disgust.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.562

I wondered, while I experienced how little reality there is in external
things.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.563

<paren> Writing the 21.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,61.564

I went BOSWELL-1783-2,61.565

and visited Lord Gardenstone, who was confined to the house, this
forenoon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.566

I had not visited him for many years, I know not why.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.567

I found his conversation both substantial and animated;
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.568

and as we are prone to look at objects with the eyes of those with
whom we are at the time, if we have any respect for their faculties,
I was the better for hearing him give an account of his views of life.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.569

He told me he never had higher views than to be a judge in Scotland,
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.570

and he was made a judge in his forty-second year.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.571

I asked him if he never had high ambitious views, which make me unhappy.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.572

He said never.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.573

Nay, he had his mind prepared for being disappointed of a judge's place
, BOSWELL-1783-2,61.574

and was to have retired to the country.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.575

He said he never had five minutes'uneasiness at a time except from a
bad hand at whist or a bad partner.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.576

All this <paren> if true <$$paren> was sound philosophy,
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.577

and I thought I might have it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.578

But it was being contented with a lower state than what my keen and
constant wishes for years have prompted, and which I have an impression
I ought not to despair of obtaining.  BOSWELL-1783-2,61.579

The great difficulty is to settle between foolish fancy and spirited
ambition; BOSWELL-1783-2,61.580

and probably I shall dream and balance till it is too late to exert.
BOSWELL-1783-2,61.581

<P_62>

Thursday 20 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.583

Sir Walter and Grange dined with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.584

I called a little on Maclaurin after dinner.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.585

Went to the Pantheon in the evening to hear a debate on this curious
question: whether it was most culpable for a young woman to marry an
old man or for an old woman to marry a young man.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.586

But it was so crowded and blackguard, I soon left it in disgust.
BOSWELL-1783-2,62.587

Grange supped with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.588

I was now happy in the consciousness that I had written every letter which
I had any call to write, and in short that I was upon very even terms
with my duty in life in small or in great things.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.589

I had not much practice in the Court of Session.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.590

But I did well what was entrusted to me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.591

I had a regular weekly return of work and weather from Mr. James
Bruce, my faithful overseer at Auchinleck, BOSWELL-1783-2,62.592

and I wrote to him as regularly.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.593

<paren> Writing on the 26.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,62.595

My wife and I and Miss McAdam dined at Dr. Webster's with Sir
Charles and Miss Preston, etc. BOSWELL-1783-2,62.596

I was pleased with the manners of Mr. Watson of Saughton, a man
against whom there is a general prejudice.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.597

I drank some claret with His Holiness, which pleased me at the time and
did me no harm afterwards.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.598

I was in a good manly frame.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.599

The Laird of Fairlie, who came to town yesterday, Mr. Matthew
Dickie, and Captain Trotter, Mortonhall's son, supped with us.
BOSWELL-1783-2,62.600

I was cheerful and moderate.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.601

Saturday 22 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.602

<paren> Writing on the 26.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,62.603

I took a walk to Leith BOSWELL-1783-2,62.604

and paid a visit to David Boswell and his wife.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.605

Poor man, though he be a dancing-master, he is a branch of the family
of Auchinleck, BOSWELL-1783-2,62.606

and gets his bread honestly.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.607

I regret that my wife will not receive him and his wife to dine with
us privately.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.608

She is wrong.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.609

I am however to have him to dine with me soon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,62.610

I met Colonel Montgomerie a little before dinner in Princes Street,
BOSWELL-1783-2,62.611

and engaged him to dine with us <P_63> without ceremony.
BOSWELL-1783-2,63.612

We had also the Laird of Fairlie, Mr. Thomas Smith, Craigengillan's
agent <paren> first time <$$paren>, young Craigengillan and his tutor,
and the young Campbells.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.613

I was quite sober, BOSWELL-1783-2,63.614

and was truly happy to find that the rage for strong liquor, which used
to vex me, had ceased.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.615

Such is the agreeable change which I have experienced in my constitution
within these seven or eight months.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.616

In the evening I accompanied Colonel Montgomerie to Fortune's, where
he was engaged with a party, all of my acquaintance but one, to sup
and hear MacLauchlan, the excellent fiddler, play Highland tunes.
BOSWELL-1783-2,63.617

The company with us was Colonel John Macdonell, Colonel Wemyss, Sir John
Scott, and Mr. MacNeill of Colonsay, whom I had never seen before.
BOSWELL-1783-2,63.618

He is proprietor of one of the Hebrides, twelve miles long and I think
four broad, and I believe of another island also.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.619

I loved him at once; BOSWELL-1783-2,63.620

for he told me there was in his island an ancient building raised by
St. Columba before he went to Iona; that it never had a roof,
for that the Saint had vowed not to settle anywhere from whence he could
see Ireland; and having descried Ireland from Colonsay after the walls
of his building were up, he stopped and left it, BOSWELL-1783-2,63.621

and Mr. MacNeill said he himself had built a stone wall round it
to secure it from being hurt.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.622

He also spoke with admiration of Dr. Johnson's <font> Journey,
<$$font> BOSWELL-1783-2,63.623

repeated some passages of it, BOSWELL-1783-2,63.624

and said he was angry at his countrymen for imagining that it was
unfavourably intended.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.625

I was surprised with this gentleman.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.626

I expected to have found him a rough Highlander.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.627

But he proved to be a well-informed man of the world.
BOSWELL-1783-2,63.628

He knew the most fashionable people.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.629

He spoke French well.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.630

I drank a little weak gin punch without souring, BOSWELL-1783-2,63.631

and relished the fiddler's music and the company so well that I did not
get home till about two in the morning.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.632

But I was not in the least inflamed.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.633

I thought in my chair coming home of Dr. Johnson's observation that
no society is so agreeable as that in a tavern.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.634

My rheumatism was now gone.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.635

But a large pimple on one of my hands had turned to a sore which was
painful and troubled me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.636

I am too easily troubled.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.637

Sunday 23 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.638

<paren> Writing the 26.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,63.639

Was at the New Church both forenoon and afternoon, BOSWELL-1783-2,63.640

but attended indifferently.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.641

Dr. Carlyle preached in the afternoon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,63.642

I was in that kind of frame in which I believe a great many men are
during the course of their lives: BOSWELL-1783-2,63.643

I was <P_64> well enough, without any lively sensation at all.
BOSWELL-1783-2,64.644

The children said divine lessons in the evening.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.645

Grange supped with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.646

I fell into a fretful fit.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.647

The Hon. A. Gordon drank tea with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.648

Was"pressed with the load of life. "BOSWELL-1783-2,64.652

But when I got home, dictated law papers pretty well.
BOSWELL-1783-2,64.653

Was at a meeting of proprietors of land to consider of an application
to Parliament to improve the rights of voting in our counties;
BOSWELL-1783-2,64.654

was in such low spirits that it seemed to me a matter of indifference.
BOSWELL-1783-2,64.655

There was a fire in the close next to our court just before dinner,
which gave some alarm but was extinguished.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.656

Grange dined with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.657

Mr. George Wallace and the Hon. Alexander Gordon, who came
to inquire how we were, drank some wine.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.658

Tuesday 25 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.659

<paren> Writing the 28.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,64.660

Had a large company at dinner: Lord Gardenstone, who had never before
been with me.  Lord Eskgrove, the successor of my father on the bench,
Commissioner Cochrane, etc. BOSWELL-1783-2,64.661

Had no vivid enjoyment, BOSWELL-1783-2,64.662

but in a discontented frame speculated on every man's situation who was
at table compared with my own, BOSWELL-1783-2,64.663

but relished none of them.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.664

Languished for London, Parliament, or any state of animated exertion.
BOSWELL-1783-2,64.665

Was vexed this forenoon by hearing the Lord President and several others
of the judges give what I thought most erroneous opinions against my
client Garallan, though Lords Braxfield, Monboddo, Hailes, and others
were for him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.666

Perhaps it is a weakness to be hurt like Heraclitus at observing the
faults of human nature.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.667

But I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.668

Wednesday 26 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.669

Mr. R. Mackintosh, who after an absence of many years
appeared at our bar today to support the Earl of Crawford against Lady
Mary Campbell's claim for the family estate, interested me as an able
unfortunate man.  BOSWELL-1783-2,64.670

His stately appearance too <P_65> had influence upon me.
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.671

I had been very keen against him in his contest with my friend Dempster
, BOSWELL-1783-2,65.672

and knew not how he might think of me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.673

Yet I wished to show him attention.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.674

He addressed himself to me very politely, BOSWELL-1783-2,65.675

and I sat down by him BOSWELL-1783-2,65.676

and had some good talk.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.677

There was something curious in seeing him in the Court again after so long
an absence, and something humbling to think that it was much diminished
in dignity and abilities since he left it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.678

<paren> Writing 2 March.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,65.679

I dictated a great deal today, having several law papers to write.
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.680

I was sensible that I was not fit to go through a great deal of business.
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.681

Yet I repined that I had too little; though I considered that a gentleman
of good fortune never gets much practice at our bar, and that I had more
than anyone in that situation ever had.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.682

Grange and Mr. Lawrie dined with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.683

Formerly Mr. Lawrie used to eat almost constantly at my table,
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.684

but it being disagreeable to my wife and indeed to myself to have
him constantly since he had a family of his own, I invite him rarely.
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.685

Veronica continues to be a day-boarder at Mrs. Billingsley's.
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.686

Phemie was fixed as a boarder both day and night.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.687

But she cried so much that after persisting for a week, we allowed her
to come home every evening as well as her sister.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.688

Thursday 27 February.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.689

<paren> Writing 2 March.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,65.690

I went in the forenoon BOSWELL-1783-2,65.691

and paid a visit to Mr. R. Mackintosh at Paterson the
stabler's in the Pleasance; BOSWELL-1783-2,65.692

found him surrounded with law books and papers and quite like a man
immersed in business.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.693

He talked in a style much above common, with a force and a command
of expression and a manly manner which I admired, while I felt for
him on account of the state of his affairs, which I was told was bad.
BOSWELL-1783-2,65.694

I paid him much attention, partly from benevolence, partly from my
never-failing wish to know distinguished men.  BOSWELL-1783-2,65.695

Clerk Matthew and some more secondary company <P_66> dined with us.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.696

In the evening I was sadly shocked by a visit of Mr. Crosbie's
clerk, Mr. Maule, who with tears in his eyes showed me a letter
to his master telling him that if he did <paren> writing 7 March
<$$paren> not pay fifteen guineas, he should be apprehended next day.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.697

I had been put upon my guard against applications for money from that
quarter, BOSWELL-1783-2,66.698

and told what was true: that I had at present no money but what I
borrowed; BOSWELL-1783-2,66.699

and so waived the demand at the time, BOSWELL-1783-2,66.700

but said I should endeavour to get the affair settled next morning,
which indeed I hoped to do with the assistance of others at the bar.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.701

How wretched a change was it for a man of uncommon knowledge, abilities
, and spirit to be thus in danger of imprisonment for a small sum!

Maclaurin accosted me in the Court of Session thus: BOSWELL-1783-2,66.705

"You would do nothing last night for an old friend," BOSWELL-1783-2,66.706

and told me that Mr. Ilay Campbell had paid ten and he five
guineas to relieve Crosbie.  BOSWELL-1783-2,66.707

I was uneasy a little to think that my benevolence might be suspected.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.708

Yet I was conscious how sincerely I felt for Crosbie, and that in case
of necessity, I should have advanced the fifteen guineas for him, though
I doubted if it would be right to contract more debt while in reality
I as yet owed more than my funds could discharge.  BOSWELL-1783-2,66.709

And Maclaurin observed that it was wrong in Crosbie to take money from
one of us and give to any other person.  BOSWELL-1783-2,66.710

It would be better for him to clear himself by a <font> cessio bonorum,
<$$font> and then take aids from his friends.  BOSWELL-1783-2,66.711

I had this evening Mr. R. Mackintosh, Mr. Ilay
Campbell <paren> appointed Solicitor-General <$$paren>, Mr.
George Wallace, the Laird of Fairlie, and Grange at supper.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.712

I drank almost a bottle of claret, as we sat till near three in the
morning.  BOSWELL-1783-2,66.713

Mackintosh harangued fluently but with too much vanity.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.714

Mr. Campbell was as usual silent and indifferent.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.715

But he gave a wonderful testimony of his confined Scottish views.
BOSWELL-1783-2,66.716

He said Sir Gilbert Elliot and Lord Advocate, he thought, would have
done better to have continued at the bar here.  BOSWELL-1783-2,66.717

I exclaimed,"I would rather have vital motion in the House of Commons
than be Lord President of the Court of Session. "BOSWELL-1783-2,66.718

Mackintosh seemed to think of <P_67> returning to the practice of the
law here, as there was now a great opening for one of his seniority
and abilities.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.719

The Solicitor encouraged him to return.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.720

I secretly dreaded that he might be mortified by neglect.

The children said divine lessons.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.735

Sir Charles Preston and the Hon. and Rev. James Cochrane
supped with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.736

I have for some time been in a state of mind not so bad as miserable,
but insipid and uneasy, having no pursuits that animate me, and viewing
life as hardly worth being in earnest.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.737

I am lamentably indifferent to religion.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.738

It is amazing how very different I am at different times.

Had Mr. James Donaldson at dinner.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.742

His petulance was displeasing.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.743

But I take notice of him on his father's account.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.744

Was at Barnard's ball at night BOSWELL-1783-2,67.745

and saw my daughters dance.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.746

First time of my being at a public place since my father's death,
BOSWELL-1783-2,67.747

and this was a kind of duty.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.748

My wife got a fright with a carriage coming near a chair in which were
two of our children, which made her spit blood.  BOSWELL-1783-2,67.749

<paren> Writing the 13.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,68.768

I dined at Lord Eskgrove's with Lord Alva and son, Maclaurin, etc.
BOSWELL-1783-2,68.769

Drank so much as to be a little heated.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.770

But our conversation was pretty good.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.771

Lord Eskgrove made a pretty just remark which was new to me: that
decisions of the courts in England are not found fault with as in
Scotland, because <font> there <$$font> a number of lawyers who are not
in a cause attend to it and form an impartial opinion.  Whereas here,
except in a very few instances, no lawyers attend to a cause except those
interested in it, so that in every case there is one side to rail from
prejudice or bias.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.772

Grange and I supped at Dr. Webster's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.777

Little James, who had been very ill from the effects of mercury
given him for his scorbutic complaint, was now a good deal better.
BOSWELL-1783-2,68.778

His mother and I had a sad alarm about him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.779

She had no return of the spitting of blood.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.780

Dr. Gillespie dined with us today.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.781

I dined at Lady Colville's with Lord Kellie, who returned from London
last night.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.784

His steady sense and preferring a creditable private life to the bustle
of Court or Parliament struck me to meditation.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.785

The Lords of Session disregarded my paper for the fly proprietors.
BOSWELL-1783-2,68.788

I was so much hurt by what I thought gross injustice that I really
inclined never to enter the Court again.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.789

Grange and I paid a visit to Sir Alexander Dick, BOSWELL-1783-2,68.790

and Grange dined with me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,68.791

I thought of setting out for London next morning, BOSWELL-1783-2,68.792

Wrote most part of No. 66.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.801

It was the Fast Day before the Sacrament.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.802

Sir W. Forbes paid me a private visit.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.803

I was somewhat hurried, notwithstanding two days of preparation.
BOSWELL-1783-2,69.804

Got into the Dumfries diligence at four in the morning,
BOSWELL-1783-2,69.808

and with two other gentlemen reached Moffat about six in the evening.
BOSWELL-1783-2,69.809

They went on to Dumfries.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.810

I sent for my brother John, who was glad to see me, and seemed in so
cordial a frame that I resolved to stay a day here, though I risked the
fly to Carlisle being full next day.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.811

Moffat has a very agreeable place in my mind, as I there first saw the
gaiety of genteel company, and as I there have meditated much when my
fancy was finer than it now is.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.812

We drank tea comfortably, BOSWELL-1783-2,69.813

and I invited Mr. Little, the landlord, to sup with us, which
he did.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.814

He is my old acquaintance and my client.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.815

Saturday 15 March.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.816

<paren> Writing the 22.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,69.817

I breakfasted with John at his room, by invitation.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.818

I wished to pay him all proper attention, BOSWELL-1783-2,69.819

and I submitted to continual restraint in conversation with him, as he
is proud and irritable.  BOSWELL-1783-2,69.820

We walked to the well and about the village on all quarters.
BOSWELL-1783-2,69.821

His recovery of reason to the degree which he now has <P_70> it, after
being several years in confinement, is remarkable.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.822

But he <paren> writing the 24 <$$paren> told me he had been drinking
hard of late, which alarmed me, BOSWELL-1783-2,70.823

and I counselled him against it.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.824

We saw Lord Hopetoun's house here.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.825

The landlord dined with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.826

Then we had coffee, BOSWELL-1783-2,70.827

and a little after seven I got into the diligence from Glasgow to
Carlisle , in which was only a son of Mr. Gillespie at Douglas
Mill, who was going out to Canada.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.828

The weather was cold, BOSWELL-1783-2,70.829

and I felt it disagreeable and somewhat mean to travel in a stage-machine
.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.830

But I considered that it was wise for me to be rigidly economical
till at least my funds should be quite sufficient to pay all my debts.
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.831

Sunday 16 March.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.832

<paren> Writing the 24.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,70.833

Arrived at the Bush Inn, Carlisle, about four in the morning.
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.834

Lay down without throwing off my clothes, having bad accommodation,
as fly passengers are looked upon as low people.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.835

Rose between eight and nine.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.836

Went to the deanery, where my friend Dr. Percy, formerly Dean,
now Bishop of Dromore, was ready to receive me, as I had engaged on his
invitation to be with him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.837

Was sorry to hear from him that his only son, who had gone to Italy for
the recovery of his health from an asthmatic complaint, was given over.
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.838

But as I perceived that the Bishop could be social notwithstanding
, I did not affect to dwell long upon the melancholy subject.
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.839

We talked as usual of Dr. Johnson.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.840

I regretted that there was not somebody continually to collect his
sayings.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.841

"Why,"said the Bishop,"you collect.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.842

""But I have little opportunity,"said I.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.843

"You all collect some.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.844

But I venture more than any of you.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.845

I am like the man'who gathers samphire, dreadful trade. '
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.846

I gather upon the face of the rock while there is a storm. "
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.847

"True,"said the Bishop.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.848

"Others will pick up a flower in the meadow. "BOSWELL-1783-2,70.849

The allusion was not amiss to the difference between conversing with
the Doctor when mild and when passionate.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.850

Mrs. Percy and the Bishop's two daughters appeared at breakfast.
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.851

He ordered my baggage to be brought from the inn, that I might be his
guest at the deanery in full hospitality.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.852

We went to the cathedral in the forenoon.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.853

Mr. Archdeacon Paley preached uncommonly well.
BOSWELL-1783-2,70.854

There was a very good organist.  BOSWELL-1783-2,70.855

I had not the exquisite sensations from being <P_71> in England which
I had in my youth, BOSWELL-1783-2,71.856

but was steady as a laird.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.857

I was somewhat cold and uneasy after last night's fatigue.
BOSWELL-1783-2,71.858

The Bishop took the ladies and me out an airing {COM:sic} in his coach.
BOSWELL-1783-2,71.859

It pleased me to see him enjoying such a respectable situation, in which
he seemed to be easier than I could have imagined, considering how humble
his original state was.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.860

He told me that he was with Shenstone soon after Toldervy, a London rider
<paren> who while he took orders for linen, I believe, was at the same
time employed by some London booksellers to compile a Tour <$$paren>, had
been catched by him copying some of his inscriptions to insert; and his
purpose being discovered, Shenstone had prevailed with him to show him his
notes, in which he found all the absurdities which circulated concerning
him in the neighbourhood; how Maria was a lady in love with him who broke
her heart because he refused her, and such stuff.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.861

He coaxed Toldervy to leave his notes of the Leasowes to have additions
made to them, BOSWELL-1783-2,71.862

and put him off from time to time till the first volume of the <font>
Tour <$$font> was published, and an account helped by Mr. Shenstone
himself was promised in the second volume.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.863

But the first not having succeeded, it never appeared.
BOSWELL-1783-2,71.864

So Shenstone escaped what his extreme sensibility was frightened to
think might come out.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.865

The Bishop was led to tell me this anecdote from my mentioning Pennant,
whose <font> Tour <$$font> he said was written in the style of a rider.
BOSWELL-1783-2,71.866

We went to evening prayers, after which we had a very good dinner,
the archdeacon and Counsellor Clark with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.867

Our conversation turned chiefly on the strange state of politics.
BOSWELL-1783-2,71.868

The Bishop however enlivened it with literary anecdote.
BOSWELL-1783-2,71.869

He told us that Morell, S. T. P., who is an excellent
Greek scholar and is supposed to have helped Dr. Gregory Sharpe,
who was very ambitious to appear a scholar, used to compose words for
Handel's music, and Handel used to carry him down with him to - , where
he entertained him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.870

Morell could not live without his wife.  BOSWELL-1783-2,71.871

So he had her conveyed down and lodged in a garret, the window
of which looked <P_72> into the room where Handel and he dined.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.872

Handel had always a good dinner; BOSWELL-1783-2,72.873

and as he was blind, Morell used to make signs to his wife most
significantly, pointing to a fowl or veal or whatever dishes were upon
the table, that she might choose what she liked, which she did by a nod;
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.874

and Morell, having a waiter in his confidence, had it carried to her.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.875

I was much satisfied with the Bishop's having repaired the
deanery and preserved the old Gothic style with modern elegance.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.876

Mr. Clark stayed supper, after which the Bishop assembled his
family and read prayers, partly from the evening service, partly by the
Bishop of Man.  BOSWELL-1783-2,72.877

It was very agreeable to me to be present at this decent family devotion.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.878

I had a very excellent apartment, which I enjoyed much after last
night's uneasiness.  BOSWELL-1783-2,72.879

Monday 17 March.  BOSWELL-1783-2,72.880

<paren> Writing the 24.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,72.881

The Bishop showed me the correspondence between him and Drs. Blair
and Ferguson concerning Ossian, in which I thought my countrymen made
but a shabby figure; though I also thought the Bishop insisted too much
upon the evidence of minutes kept by him, which he showed me, and I saw
were very curt and did not mention having heard Erse poetry repeated at
Dr. Ferguson's, but only fixed the date of his drinking tea there.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.882

The Bishop was very keen and violent upon the subject.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.883

This was a fresh instance of the uncertainty of literary friendship.
BOSWELL-1783-2,72.884

But to own the truth, my mind was now in such an indifferent frame that
I looked on all human concerns as scenes in a drama, and it did not
seriously affect me.  BOSWELL-1783-2,72.885

I paid a visit to the Miss Waughs and to Dr. Carlyle, an old
connexion <P_73> of our family.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.886

I walked with the Bishop, BOSWELL-1783-2,73.887

and dined well again with him.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.888

He gave me hopes of a visit at Auchinleck.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.889

About five o'clock I got into the post-coach for London, which travelled
on night and day till it arrived at the Bell Savage Inn upon Ludgate
Hill on Thursday evening the 20.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.890

I group the days of this journey together, as nothing happened worth
recording.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.891

I was absolutely distressed with the fatigue, BOSWELL-1783-2,73.892

and thought this mode of travelling a punishment to which I would never
again submit.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.893

I made the most of what companions I had in the coach that my humour
inclined me to do.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.894

But that was not much.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.895

I took a hackney-coach BOSWELL-1783-2,73.896

and drove to Mr. Dilly's, my constant landing-place, where I
found a cordial reception.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.897

Friday 21 March.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.898

<paren> Writing the 24.  <$$paren> BOSWELL-1783-2,73.899

My brother David breakfasted with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.900

I called at Dr. Johnson's, BOSWELL-1783-2,73.901

and was told he was at Mrs. Thrale's.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.902

Went to Nerot's BOSWELL-1783-2,73.903

and got my hair dressed, so as to appear decently well.
BOSWELL-1783-2,73.904

Felt a steadiness as Laird of Auchinleck which I never before experienced
in London, BOSWELL-1783-2,73.905

Went to Mrs. Thrale's in Argyll Buildings.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.906

Was shown into Dr. Johnson's room.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.907

He said,"I am glad you are come.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.908

I am very ill. "BOSWELL-1783-2,73.909

I was disagreeably surprised to find him looking very pale, and afflicted
with a difficulty of breathing.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.910

For in his last letter to me he said nothing of his being ill again.
BOSWELL-1783-2,73.911

I shall collect his conversation as well as I can.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.912

He said the superiority of a country gentleman over the people on his
estate was very agreeable, and that whoever says he does not feel it
agreeable, lies.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.913

For it must be agreeable to have a casual superiority over those who
are by nature equal with us.  BOSWELL-1783-2,73.914

I objected great proprietors of land preferring living in London.
BOSWELL-1783-2,73.915

"Why, Sir,"said he,"the pleasure <P_74> of living in London and the
intellectual superiority to be enjoyed there may counterbalance the other.
BOSWELL-1783-2,74.916

Besides, a man may prefer the state of the country gentleman upon the
whole, BOSWELL-1783-2,74.917

and yet there may never be a moment when he is willing to make the
change. "BOSWELL-1783-2,74.918

He said,"It is better to have five per cent out of land than out of money,
because it is more secure; BOSWELL-1783-2,74.919

but the readiness of transference and promptness of interest make many
people prefer the funds. "BOSWELL-1783-2,74.920

He said,"A man is not so much afraid of being a hard creditor as of
being a hard landlord. "BOSWELL-1783-2,74.921

"Because,"said I,"there is a sort of kindly connexion between a landlord
and his tenants. "BOSWELL-1783-2,74.922

"No, Sir,"said he.  BOSWELL-1783-2,74.923

"Many landlords here never see their tenants.  BOSWELL-1783-2,74.924

It is because if a landlord drives away his tenants, he may not get
others; whereas the demand for money is so great it may always be lent.
"BOSWELL-1783-2,74.925

He imputed the present anarchy in Government in a good measure to the
Revolution.  BOSWELL-1783-2,74.926

"For,"said he,"this Havoverian family is <font> isole`e <$$font> here.
BOSWELL-1783-2,74.927

They have no friends.  BOSWELL-1783-2,74.928

Now the Stuarts had friends who stuck by them so late as 1745.
BOSWELL-1783-2,74.929

When the right of the King is not reverenced, there will not be reverence
for those appointed by the King. "BOSWELL-1783-2,74.930
