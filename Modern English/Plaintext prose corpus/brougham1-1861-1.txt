A medical practitioner I am resolved to be, somehow or other,

Herb. Then listen to me, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.200

and let me have your advice.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.201

My wife is the victim of some concealed sorrow, the cause of which I
$can $n't {TEXT:can't} divine.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.202

Since our marriage we have lived only for each other, as you know;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.203

the years flew by in calm tranquillity, happy in our mutual confidence,
happy in our entwined affection.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.204

Dr. S. But surely - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.205

Herb. Wait; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.206

not long since, only a few months ago, it smote upon my heart like a
sudden stab that there was a something, I knew not what, wanting in our
perfect understanding of each other.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.207

I could accuse myself of no concealment except of that one shadow of
surmise; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.208

hour by hour, however, my suspicions grew to certainty;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.209

I could perceive that her gaiety was unreal, assumed, constrained,
put on while we were together, only to be abandoned when she was alone.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.210

Well, one day I had just quitted her, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.211

and urged almost to desperation by the cruel doubts that oppressed me,
I - I listened at her door, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.212

I - I looked through her keyhole, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.213

I did, William, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.214

I did; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.215

the hot blood sears my cheek for it, now, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.216

but I <font> was <$$font> that abject, cowardly thing, that miserably
mean eavesdropper.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.217

Once, only <font> once <$$font>, upon my honour - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.218

honour?  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.219

- <font> my <$$font> honour?  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.220

Well, I was punished for it, amply, deservedly, when I saw the lie
pass from her brow, and the truth, the terrible truth reveal itself;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.221

she <font> had <$$font> deceived me, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,7.222

the echo of the merry laugh with which she parted from me had scarcely
<P_8> died away, before I saw her gaze with a sad, painful expression
upon the door I had passed through, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.223

and she wept - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.224

wept, I tell you, man, a flood of silent, agonizing tears,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.225

and I, who but a few moments before would have faced her lightest sorrow
, at the peril of my life, my soul, felt a curse spring upward from my
heart; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.226

but my great love compelled it back, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.227

and changed it to a grief.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.228

Oh, William, I could cry now like a child, like a child.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.229

Dr. S. And from as small a cause, no doubt.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.230

Herb. You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} question the sincerity of my
suffering, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.231

how long is it since you made this grim discovery?  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.238

Herb. Three months and five days.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.239

Dr. S. $There $'s {TEXT:There's} nothing like being

Herb. Of course not; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.242

do you think me insane?  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.243

Dr. S. Not yet; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,8.244

Whenever I saw a truly happy couple, I was instantly inoculated with
the infection, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.552

and looked about me eagerly to find a desirable partner,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.553

some accidental scene of domestic disquiet would be sure to send me back
into my shell like a frightened snail.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.554

Herb. This visit of yours is somewhat unexpected, uncle.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.555

Uncle $T. {TEXT:missing_T.} Yes, my boy, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll}

Sister Patience and I were invited to a wedding about a month ago,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.557

and the delight of the young people made me feel so like a
malefactor that I resolved to put a speedy end to my bachelor days.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.558

Now, our village is not an extensive place for matrimonial operations,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,16.559

this uncertainty is more <P_25> than I can bear, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.888

and to persist in such a life of mutual deception would be unworthy
and humiliating.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.889

Mrs. S. I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know really how to counsel
you; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.890

I never met with a case like yours, seeming to love each other so
devotedly - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.891

and yet, by-the-bye, <font> do <$$font> you love him?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.892

Mrs. H. Do you love <font> your <$$font> husband?
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.894

Mrs. S. Oh, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} a different thing;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.895

My insensible brute $do $n't {TEXT:don't} seem to care whether I love
him or not, BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.897

and so I never ask myself the question.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.898

Mrs. H. Ah!  if I could arrive at such indifference,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.899

but it is Herbert alone who is blest with so apathetic a temperament.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.900

Mrs. S. I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} believe it.

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.904

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.907

Mrs. H. Fanny!  why, I never dreamt of such a thing!
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.908

Mrs. S. Oh!  I know $it $'s {TEXT:it's} very terrible and
Frenchy, and all that sort of thing; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.909

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.913

Mrs. S. How nice, and good, and primitive you are, dear.
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,25.914

If there were any harm, do you suppose I would advise it?

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,26.930

Mrs. S. Of course he is; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,26.931

A pretty business $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} upon - truly, a very nice employment
for a middle-aged married medical practitioner, commissioned to do the
fascinating, with <font> malice prepense <$$font>, to serve a friend;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,26.943

BROUGHAM1-1861-1,26.946

I $did $n't {TEXT:didn't} arrive at the absolute extent of my impertinence
until I came to put it in practice; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,26.947

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} not an easy thing to do when a man's heart;
if he be possessed of that anatomical superfluity, is interested;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,26.948

but to administer a dose of admiration with professional <font> sa`ng

Mrs. H. I was admiring the sweet expression of your eyes.

Mrs. H. Yes, blue gray: BROUGHAM1-1861-1,27.987

softness and brilliancy combined.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,27.988

Dr. S. Hem!  $you $'re {TEXT:you're} pleased to be

some wondrously important trifle, $I $'ve {TEXT:I've} no doubt;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,28.1017

you women have an unhappy facility for inflating small troubles,

great ones.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,28.1018

Mrs. H. <paren> <font> rises <$$font> <$$paren> And you men,

Mrs. H. Why should women be judged by the same standard

the active work of life which would bring with it equal health
of mind, you deny them participation in, be they capable or not,
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,28.1023

and when thought wearied for want of occupation, or filled with fears
which are perhaps too flattering, their very apprehension is made the

all I have to say upon the subject at present is, that the lines of

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} not of the most diffident disposition in the world;
BROUGHAM1-1861-1,30.1096

but, really, the suddenness of this announcement has plunged me into a

the remedy is in my own hands.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,30.1103

For my friend's sake, I must suppress the horror that her perfidy inspires

be culpable.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,30.1104

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} a traitorous, treacherous proceeding;

Mrs. H. <paren> <font> rising <$$font> <$$paren> Well,
Doctor, you despise me, of course - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,30.1107

Dr. S. Oh!  Mrs. Waverley, you may have some
reasonable show of vindication, in your sex's proverbial weakness;

Oh!  the hypocritical profligate.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,31.1127

Dr. S. And therefore if your love be as strong as mine,

Mrs. H. Fly, sir; BROUGHAM1-1861-1,31.1129

where?  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,31.1130

Dr. S. Anywhere - everywhere - BROUGHAM1-1861-1,31.1131

Dr. S. Well, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} matter-of-fact enough

never!  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,32.1169

Mrs. H. I confess, dear, I am both pained and surprised.

You must be satisfied that by no look or word of mine have I given him
the slightest encouragement.  BROUGHAM1-1861-1,32.1171

Mrs. S. But he might have kept his guilty passion buried in

Mrs. H. Was it not at your own desire?
