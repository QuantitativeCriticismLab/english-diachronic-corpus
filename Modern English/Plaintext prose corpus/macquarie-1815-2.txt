Tuesday 25 April 1815.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.6

At 8 o'clock this morning Mrs. Macquarie and myself, after having
taken leave of our beloved infant, set out in the carriage on our long
projected journey to visit the new discovered country to the westward
of the Blue Mountains.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.7

Arrived at Parramatta at half past 9 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.8

Breakfasted MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.9

and remained there till 1 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.10

and then set out for Mrs. King's farm on the South Creek, where
we arrived at 3 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.11

and took our quarters up here for the night; the distance from Sydney
being 32 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.12

We were accompanied from Parramatta by Major Antill, Lieut. Watts
, Doctor Redfern, and Mr. Hassall to Mrs. King's farm,
where we found Mr. Cox and Mr. Meehan waiting for us.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.13

We all dined here very comfortably MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.14

and went to bed at an early hour.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.15

Wednesday 26 April.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.16

Got up early MACQUARIE-1815-2,89.17

and set out from Mrs. <P_90> King's farm at 7 o'clock this morning
for Sir Jno. Jamison's farm of Regent-Ville on the left bank of the
River Nepean, where we had engaged to breakfast.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.18

We arrived here at 8 o'clock after a ride of 6 miles from Mrs.
King's.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.19

We sent our carriage and horses to cross the river a mile lower down at
Emu Ford.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.20

We found Secretary Campbell and Mr. Oxley waiting for us at Sir
Jno. Jamison's.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.21

Sir John gave us a very hearty good breakfast, MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.22

and after resting ourselves at Regent-Ville for a couple of hours,
we crossed the river from thence to Emu Plains in the Government Boat
<font> Pheasant, <$$font> Sir John accompanying us and now making one
of our party.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.23

Our carriage and horses were waiting for us at the Government Stock-Yard
on Emu Plains; MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.24

and the Government herd of young heifers having been collected there
for the purpose by Mr. Hassall, we stopt for a little to inspect
and look at them; after which we pursued our journey across Emu-Plains.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.25

Mrs. Macquarie and myself mounted our horses at the Three Mile
Tree from Emu Ford, which is immediately at the foot of the Mountains,
at half past 12 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.26

and we continued our journey up the mountain, the ascent of
which is pretty steep and sharp for about 3 quarters of a mile,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.27

and then we proceeded on a gentle aclivity as far as the First
Depo`t , distant 6 miles from Emu Ford, which we reached at 1 o'clock
MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.28

and stopt there for about a quarter of an hour.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.29

Here a corporal and 3 privates of the Royal Veteran Company are stationed.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.30

Mr. Hassall and Mr. George Cox, son of Wm.
Cox Esqr. accompanied us as far as the 1st Depo`t
MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.31

and there took their leave of us.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.32

From the 1st Depo`t we continued our journey through an open hilly
forest with gentle ascents and descents occasionally, for six miles,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.33

but the road very good all the way.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.34

We then halted at three o'clock in a very pretty wooded plain near a
spring of very good fresh water, MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.35

and pitched our tent near the side of the road.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,90.36

This stage is 12 miles from <P_91> Emu Ford and our first on the
Mountains.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.37

The place being very pretty I have named it Spring-Wood.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.38

We dined at 1$$2 past 4 MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.39

and played cards in our tent in the evening, drinking tea afterwards;
retiring to rest at an early hour.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.40

Thursday 27 April.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.41

Sent off our heavy baggage at 1$$2 past 7 o'clock this morning from
Spring-Wood.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.42

Breakfasted ourselves at 1$$2 past 8, MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.43

and set out in the carriage at 1$$2 past ten on our journey.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.44

For the first few miles the road was through an open forest and very
good - MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.45

but we soon came to a very hilly broken country and rough stony road,
especially on reaching The Bluff Bridge, it being very bad and hilly from
thence for five miles, with heavy pulls up steep hills for the cattle and
carriages, which rendered it a severe and fatiguing day's work for them.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.46

In the course of this day's ride we had very fine and extensive views
of the adjacent low country towards Windsor, Parramatta, and Prospect ,
especially from Kealy's Pile, which I named Kealy's Repulse, and from a
very beautiful table land, which last I have named the King's Table-Land.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.47

This table land is extremely beautiful MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.48

and has very fine picturesque grand scenery, consisting of deep finely
wooded glens, stupendous rocks & cliffs, with high distant hills and
mountains.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.49

From the King's Table Land we could distinctly see Windsor and some of
the reaches of the River Hawkesbury.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.50

We did not arrive at the 2d Depo`t till 5 o'clock, distant from our last
stage 16 miles, MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.51

and here we halted for the night.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.52

Owing to the badness of the road the last of our baggage did not get
up with us till 8 o'clock, which obliged us to delay dining till then.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.53

The 2d Depo`t is situated in a very pretty looking valley very well
watered, but without much good feed for cattle.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.54

Friday 28 April.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.55

Got up early MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.56

and took a walk forward for a mile to look at the road.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.57

Sent off the baggage between 7 and 8 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.58

Breakfasted at 8 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.59

and set out in the carriage at 9 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.60

This day's stage was over a hilly high country, MACQUARIE-1815-2,91.61

but the road was very good and easy for the cattle <P_92> and carriages.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.62

On the left we passed a very extensive deep romantic glen, full of very
picturesque and wild scenery.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.63

It commenced at the 33d Mile Tree MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.64

and continues all the way from thence to the 41 Mile Tree, where we
halted for this day, being 13 miles from our last halting place at the
2d Depo`t.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.65

Here we found tolerable good feed for our cattle and plenty of fresh
water, it being an open forest.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.66

We arrived at our ground at the 41 Mile Tree at 3 o'clock,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.67

dined at 5, MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.68

drank tea at 7, MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.69

and went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.70

I named the grand and picturesque extensive glen we passed this day on
our left The Regent's Glen in honor of H. R. Highness the
Prince Regent.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.71

Saturday 29 April.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.72

Rise {COM:sic} early MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.73

and sent off our heavy baggage between 7 and 8 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.74

Breakfast at 8 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.75

and set out from the 41 Mile Tree at 1$$4 past 9 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.76

At 11 o'clock reached the termination of the Blue Mountains ending in
a very abrupt descent almost perpendicular.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.77

Here we halted for a little while to view this frightful tremendous pass
, as well as to feast our eyes with the grand and pleasing prospect of
the fine low country below us and now in view from this termination of
the Blue Mountains.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.78

Mr. Cox and his party with incredible labour and perseverance have
constructed a very safe carriage road down the face of this mountain
which does him and them infinite honor; it being a most difficult and
most arduous undertaking, and one which most people would have at first
view abandoned in despair as being impracticable.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.79

From the beginning of the pass to the foot of the mountain is one mile
and a quarter in length, the road being made in traverses in as easy a
manner as it was practicable to construct it; but still exceedingly steep
in most places along the declivity of the mountain, which is above 600
feet in perpendicular height from the plain below.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.80

The distance from our last stage at the 41 Mile Tree and the Grand
Termination of the Blue Mountains is 7 3$$4 miles; MACQUARIE-1815-2,92.81

and this mountain being one of <P_93> the most prominent and remarkable
of the whole range, I have named it Mount York in honor of H.
R. Highness the Duke of York, on account of its being the only
one by which it is at all practicable to descend into the low country.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.82

The pass constructed here by Mr. Cox and his party I have named
Cox's Pass in honor of that gentleman and as a just tribute due to his
indefatigable zeal and meritorious exertions in constructing and finally
completing this grand and important pass.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.83

The road down the mountain being so extremely steep as to render it
hazardous to drive down it in the carriage, we had the horses taken out
of it MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.84

and had it brought down by hand, MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.85

and the same method was adopted in regard to bringing down our caravan
and heavy loaded carts.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.86

This retarded our journey a long time, the whole of the carriages not
having been got down the pass till 2 o'clock, tho'the first of them
began to descend at 11 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.87

Mrs. Macquarie and myself accompanied by Mr. Cox and
Mr. Secretary Campbell walked down the whole of the pass,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.88

and waited at the foot of the mountain till all the carriages had
come down.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.89

At 1$$4 past 2 p. m. we pursued our journey in the carriage
over a fine plain verdant country of open forest land through a beautiful
extensive vale of five miles, which I have named the Vale Clwydd after
the vale of the same name in Wales.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.90

This vale terminates at a river running south formed by two smaller ones
coming from the westward and eastward, and which unite at the distance
of five miles from Mount York.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.91

I have named the river thus formed Cox's River, in honor of Mr.
Cox.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.92

We arrived at this river at 3 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.93

and encamped on the left bank of the western branch of it;
having here good grass and plenty of fine water for our cattle.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.94

We dined at 5 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.95

and played cards in the evening after dinner till tea-time, retiring
early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.96

The distance of this day's journey is 14 miles from the 41 Mile Tree.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,93.97

The ground about and adjacent to the 41 Mile Tree <P_94> being a good
stage for both water and forage, and it having rather a wild heath-like
appearance, I have named it Hounslow.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.98

Sunday 30 April.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.99

We halt all this day at Cox's River on account of keeping the day holy.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.100

After breakfast I had all our servants and followers regularly paraded
and mustered, MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.101

and had Divine Service performed, the whole of our party being present.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.102

As Divine Service had been performed, the gentlemen of our party
accompanied me on a ride to Mount Blaxland, leaving Mrs. Macquarie
in camp.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.103

Mount Blaxland is distant 3 1$$2 miles west from Cox's River through a
fine open hilly country of good pasture.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.104

We ascended to the top of the mountain from whence we had a fine prospect
of the adjacent hilly country and of Wentworth's and Lawson's Sugar Loaves
in the immediate vicinity of Mount Blaxland.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.105

We returned to camp by 1$$2 past 3, MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.106

dined at 5 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.107

and retired early to rest.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.108

Monday 1 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.109

Sent off our heavy baggage between 7 and 8 o'clock this morning.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.110

Breakfasted at 8 MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.111

and set out in the carriage at 9 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.112

Mrs. M. and myself mounted our horses at the foot of the
first high hill near Mount Blaxland, it being excessively steep and long ,
for which reason I have named it Fag-Hill.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.113

A range of very lofty hills and narrow valleys, alternately, form the
tract of country lying between Cox's River and the Fish-River, which
tract I have named Clarence's Hilly Range in honor of H. R.
Highness The Duke of Clarence.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.114

This was a very trying heavy stage for our cattle, there
being such numerous steep ascents and descents the whole way.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.115

We arrived at the Fish River at 3 p. m. after a fatiguing
and tiresome journey of 16 miles, halting on the left bank of the river.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.116

Some of our heavy baggage did not get up to the ground till 7 o'clock
at night.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.117

We dined at 1$$2 past 5 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.118

and had some very fine fish out of the river for dinner.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.119

Retired early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.120

Tuesday 2 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.121

Got up early MACQUARIE-1815-2,94.122

and walked out for a mile <P_95> in front to view the road.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.123

On my way back had a very fine view of Mount Evans distant about 7 or
8 miles to the north west of our present ground.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.124

Sent off our heavy baggage at 8 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.125

Breakfasted at 9 MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.126

and set out on horse-back with Mrs. M. at 10 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.127

Halted on the top of a high hill about two miles from the Fish River
to give Mrs. M. an opportunity of seeing Mount Evans,
and taking a sketch of it; which having done we pursued our journey.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.128

Halted at Sidmouth Valley at 1$$2 past 12 o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.129

and encamped here for this day in order to rest our cattle; the water
and grass being both good and abundant here.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.130

The distance between the Fish River and Sidmouth Valley is only 8 miles
, MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.131

but the country we have this day passed over is very hilly.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.132

Dined at 5 MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.133

and went early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.134

N. B. Sir Jno. Jamison was lost for some hours this
evening returning from fishing in the river, by missing his way in the
woods, MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.135

but arrived in camp about 8 o'clock with a large string of fine fish
and 2 water moles caught in the Fish-River near our present ground.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.136

Wednesday 3 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.137

Sent off our heavy baggage at 8 a. m.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.138

breakfast at 9 MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.139

and set out in the carriage with Mrs. M. at 10 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.140

At 11 a. m. between the 33d & 34th Mile, quit the carriage
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.141

and mount my horse, leaving Mrs. M. to proceed in the
carriage direct to the Campbell River.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.142

I set out accompanied by all the gentlemen of the party to explore country
along the banks of the Fish River to its junction with the Campbell River.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.143

We first arrive at O'Connell Plains, which are very beautiful to look
at but of no great extent, being only about a mile in length and half
a mile in breadth.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.144

We came in on O'Connell Plains after riding about 2 miles from
the main road to the river and tracing it half a mile down.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.145

We crossed the river at the middle of O'Connell Plains to the north
side to examine the land there, which we found as good as on the
south side, it being very excellent soil on both sides of the river.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,95.146

We then rode along a ridge of hills along the <P_96> south side of the
river for about two miles in extent before we entered into Macquarie
Plains, which we did at 1 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.147

Our first view of these plains was most grand and interesting,
presenting a beautiful rich tract of rich fertile land without hardly
a tree to be seen for four miles in length and two miles in breadth.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.148

These plains extend on both sides of the river affording beautiful
situations for farms on either bank, to the junction of the Fish River
with the Campbell River, where Macquarie Plains terminate and Bathurst
Plains commence.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.149

After tracing the Fish-River to its junction with the Campbell River,
we rode up along the right bank of the latter till we arrived where a
bridge is made across it about three miles above the confluence of the
two rivers.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.150

Here we found Mrs. Macquarie in the carriage had arrived long
before us, as well as all the baggage carts had arrived before us.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.151

Here we arrived at 2 p. m. MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.152

and took up our ground for the night; the distance from our last stage
at Sidmouth Valley being 13 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.153

Dined at 5 MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.154

and went early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.155

Thursday 4 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.156

Sent off our heavy baggage for Bathurst Plains at 8 a. m.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.157

and breakfasted at that hour.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.158

After breakfast we mounted our horses MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.159

and rode up for 3 miles along the right bank of the Campbell River to take
a view of Mitchell Plains, which is a fine rich tract of land extending
for a mile and a half along the river and for nearly half a mile on each
side of it; the land being very fit for small farms, both on account of
its richness of soil on the low grounds for cultivation, and the hills
in rear thereof being excellent for grazing.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.160

We saw great numbers of water moles in the Campbell-River at Mitchell
Plains.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.161

We came back again the same way we went from Mitchell Plains to
our last ground at the bridge over the Campbell River; from whence
we set out in the carriage for Bathurst Plains at 11 a. m.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,96.162

After riding about 9 miles through a very pretty wooded <P_97> country we
arrived on a height which commanded a very extensive, grand, and noble
view of Bathurst Plains extending on both sides of the Macquarie River
for 11 miles and for nearly 3 miles on each side of it, being almost
entirely clear of timber for that extent.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.163

Mrs. M. and myself mounted our horses when within a
mile of the Grand Depo`t on the Macquarie River, Mr. Evans the
Dy. Surveyor having rode out and met us some little time before.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.164

We arrived at the Depo`t at 1$$2 past 1 p. m. the Guard
being turned out to receive us, and the whole of the people, who gave
us three cheers!  MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.165

We found here also three adult male natives and four native boys of
this new discovered tract of country, who shewed great surprise, mixed
with no small degree of fear at seeing so many strangers, horses and
carriages, but to which they soon appeared to be reconciled on being
kindly spoken to.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.166

They were all clothed with mantles made of the skins of opossums, which
were very neatly sewn together, MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.167

and the outside of the skins were carved in a remarkable neat manner.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.168

They appear to be very inoffensive and cleanly in their persons.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,97.169

In size and appearance they are like the natives on <P_98> the east side
of the Blue Mountains; not being either stouter or taller in stature.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.170

The Grand Depo`t at Bathurst Plains is beautifully situated on a fine
commanding eminence on the left bank and south side of Macquarie River,
distant 10 1$$4 miles from our last stage at the Campbell River; the road
being very good and easy for a carriage the whole of this last stage.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.171

The appearance of Bathurst Plains from the Depo`t extending for many
miles on both sides of the Macquarie River, and surrounded at a distance
by fine verdant hills, is truly grand, beautiful and interesting, forming
one of the finest landscapes I ever saw in any country I have yet visited.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.172

The soil is uncommonly good and fertile, fit for every purpose of
cultivation and pasture, being extremely well watered, and thinly wooded.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.173

At this beautiful spot I have established my head quarters for the
present; intending hereafter to erect a town and township here for the
convenience and accommodation of such settlers as may be indulged with
grants of lands in this new discovered country.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.174

In the mean time I shall make excursions from hence into the interior
of the country in different directions.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.175

On our arrival I found one of my tents pitched here, which had been sent
on before us, and which will serve for our sleeping tent till the others
are put up in more regular order tomorrow.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.176

Mrs. M. I am happy to say, has bore the fatiguing journey
over the Blue Mountains to this place wonderfully well indeed, and has
arrived here in very good health.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.177

We sat down 12 to dinner this day at 5 o'clock in the new Government
Store; Mr. Evans having joined and being now one of our party here.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.178

We played cards in the evening between dinner and tea,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.179

and retired at an early hour to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.180

Friday 5 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.181

Got up early, MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.182

breakfasted at 9, MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.183

and at 10 o'clock we all mounted our horses, Mrs. M. being
one of the party, MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.184

and set out on an excursion to see and explore those parts of Bathurst and
Macquarie Plains on the north side of the river.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,98.185

We crossed the Macquarie River close under <P_99> the Depo`t by a very
easy fine ford of a hard pebly {COM:sic} bottom, there being very little
water in the river at present owing to the long continued droughts.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.186

We rode through a very rich low tract of land along the right bank of
the river with fine grass growing on it, between 3 and 4 feet high,
for about 6 miles; MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.187

then came to a chain or ridge of fertile wooded hills, running in a
northern direction from the confluence of the Fish and the Campbell
Rivers, and which chain of hills divide Bathurst from Macquarie Plains.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.188

On crossing these hills we had a very extensive fine view of the latter
extending along the Fish River for about five miles on each side of it.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.189

This is a most beautiful rich tract of land and very picturesque,
the grounds being much diversified in extensive plains, and hills and
dales alternately, terminating on the north in lofty wooded mountains
; near to which there are fine downs very fit for sheep walks.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.190

We hunted two native dogs, and some emus in Macquarie Plains,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.191

but were not so fortunate as to catch any of them, tho'we saw them
very distinctly, and were much gratified with the sight of them.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.192

In returning home we kept nearer the mountains in order to see more of
the country, MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.193

and were well satisfied that the greater parts of both Bathurst and
Macquarie Plains are perfectly fit for the purposes of agriculture as
well as grazing.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.194

We returned to head quarters at 2 p. m. after a
ride of about 16 miles, highly gratified with our day's excursion.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.195

On our return to head quarters, I found our other two tents pitched
in regular order, and a flagg {COM:sic} staff erected in front of our
sleeping tent, which I had given orders to be done previous to our setting
out this morning, intending to hoist the British Colours on it on Sunday
next, when it is my intention to give a name to this particular spot.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,99.196

I forgot to mention in my notes of yesterday that a very fine large black
swan, and also a very large water-mole <paren> or duck-bill <$$paren> had
been shot on the Macquarie River, near head quarters, on the afternoon
of our arrival here, which appear <P_100> as a good omen of the future
prosperity and plenty of this new country.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.197

The swan weighed {COM:missing_word} pounds MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.198

and was a remarkable large one.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.199

Saturday 6 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.200

Got up early MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.201

and breakfasted at 8 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.202

Mounted our horses at 10 o'clock, Mrs. M. forming one of
the party, MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.203

and set out on an excursion to explore the remaining parts of Bathurst
Plains on the north side of the river.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.204

We crossed them from the ford in a diagonal direction, our course being
nearly north east till we reached a rich fertile valley near the foot
of the mountains with a very pretty brook of fine fresh water running
through the middle of it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.205

This valley runs about 7 or 8 miles in length and from a quarter to half
a mile in breadth, with very fine pasture land on the hills skirting it.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.206

I have named this valley Winbourn-Dale, and the rivulet running through
it Winbourn-Brook.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.207

We rode over some very fine tracts of land this day fit for both
cultivation and pasture, and most eligible for farms of both descriptions.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.208

On return we saw some emus and kangaroos; MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.209

some of the party hunted the latter, MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.210

and the dogs came up with and caught one.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.211

Arrived at head quarters at 1 p. m. after a very
pleasant ride of about 12 miles, much pleased with our excursion.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.212

Wishing to explore the south side of the Macquarie River to the eastward
of the Depo`t for 4 or {COM:missing_word} miles, I set out again at 2
p. m. along with Mr. Cox and some other gentlemen
for this purpose, leaving Mrs. M. at home, who was a little
tired after her morning's ride.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.213

We rode along the left bank of the river over a tract of very fine
rich fertile land fit for any purpose, for about five miles to a large
beautiful reach of the river, where we saw a large swan and many ducks
swimming.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.214

I fired at the black swan with my pistol MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.215

but missed it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.216

From this part of the river we returned home by a back line
over fine hills and valleys fit for cultivation and pasture.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.217

Returned to head quarters at 4 o'clock from my last excursion after a
pleasant ride of ten miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.218

We dined at 5 MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.219

and spent the evening as usual.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,100.220

<P_101>

Sunday 7 May 1815! ! !  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.222

After breakfast, all the gentlemen and other people assembled for Prayers
and Divine Service; MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.223

but previous thereto they were all mustered for the purpose of witnessing
my christening the new intended town on this beautiful spot, which I
accordingly named Bathurst in honor of the noble Earl of that name,
now His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.224

The British Union Jack was first hoisted on the new flagg {COM:sic}
staff on this auspicious occasion, MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.225

the Military fired 3 vollies MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.226

and the whole of the people assembled <paren> being 75 in number <$$paren>
gave three cheers in honor of the ceremony.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.227

I prefaced it by complimenting Mr. Cox and Mr. Evans,
and their respective parties for discovering this fine country, and
afterwards facilitating our access to it so easily and overcoming such
extraordinary difficulties in so doing.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.228

The ceremony concluded by all of us drinking prosperity to the new town
of Bathurst.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.229

After Divine Service had been performed, I accompanied Mr. Cox ,
and Messrs. Oxley and Meehan the Surveyors, to lay down and mark
out the lines of the town of Bathurst at the spot fixed on now here
for that purpose, immediately in rear of the present head quarters;
reserving a sufficient space next the river for a small Government
Domain , extending half a mile in front and a quarter of a mile in depth.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.230

I also had marked out immediately in rear of the flagg-staff the
spot intended for the Government House being erected on hereafter.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.231

Monday 8 May 1815.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.232

Got up early MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.233

and breakfasted at 7 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.234

At 8 o'clock we mounted our horses MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.235

and set out to explore the country lying in a south west direction from
Bathurst; Mr. Evans who has already explored this country being
our guide.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.236

It being too long a ride for her Mrs. M. staid at home
this day, as did Messrs. Oxley & Meehan for the purpose of marking
out the new town, and laying it down on paper.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.237

The first four miles of our route was over a very fine rich tract of
land fit for any purpose.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,101.238

We then got into a <P_102> more hilly country but all excellent pasture
land with very few exceptions.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.239

We continued our ride along this open hilly country in a south west
direction for at least twenty miles from Bathurst, passing several
well watered pretty vallies, the low parts of which were excellent land
for cultivation.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.240

The two largest and principal vallies seen in the course of this day's
excursion I have named Queen Charlotte's Vale in honor of Her Majesty;
and Princess Charlotte's Valley in honor of the Princess Charlotte of
Wales; the former extending for about 20 miles in a S.west and N.east
direction and joining Bathurst Plains at the latter point; and the
latter extending for about 18 miles in an east and westerly direction,
and opening to the Macquarie River near Mount Pleasant at its western
extremity; the two valleys being separated by a ridge of hills, where
they respectively terminate.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.241

Both these valleys are remarkably well watered by large ponds at regular
distances contiguous to each other, which are even full of water at this
extraordinary dry season.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.242

Those two vallies are well calculated for both grazing and agricultural
farms, MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.243

and would soon repay the labour of the husbandman and grazier.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.244

We halted for near an hour at the head of Queen Charlotte's Vale to rest
and feed our horses, MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.245

and then continued our journey homewards through this beautiful fertile
vale.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.246

We saw a large flock of emus in Princess Charlotte's Valley, and a
great $number of kangaroos, pigeons, quails, and a few wild geese,
in our excursion of this day.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.247

We returned to head quarters at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, after $a very
interesting but long ride of about forty miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.248

In crossing a deep part of the Princess $Charlotte $'s {TEXT:Charlotte's}
Valley, about 12 miles from Bathurst, we fell in by mere chance with a
poor old infirm native woman with her left eye out and without a single
tooth in her head.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.249

She had a large bag on her back, MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.250

and was in the act of taking up two long poles when we came in view
of her.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.251

She was excessively alarmed and frightened on seeing us,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.252

but took up and put into her bag some pieces of biscuit we threw to her.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,102.253

On the opposite <P_103> side of the valley we saw a native boy, who the
old woman crossed over to join as soon as her fears had a little subsided.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.254

She kept chattering and pointing with both her hands to the opposite
hills from the time she first saw us till we were a considerable distance
removed from her; pointing, as we supposed, to where her friends and
tribe were to be found.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.255

Tuesday 9 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.256

Got up early, MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.257

and breakfasted at 8 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.258

At 1$$2 past 9 Mrs. M. and myself set out in the carriage,
accompanied by all the gentlemen of our party, to see Mount Pleasant
and Pine-Hill, and the country in the vicinity of those hills.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.259

The country between Bathurst and Mount Pleasant for five miles is one
continued plain of fine rich fertile land, with beautiful verdant low
wooded hills skirting it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.260

Beyond Mount Pleasant the country breaks into hills,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.261

and the plain ceases.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.262

We left Mrs. M. in the carriage at Mt. Pleasant,
the country beyond it being too rough to admit of its proceeding any
farther in this direction.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.263

The rest of the party accompanied me on horseback as far as
Pine-Hill about 7 miles to the westward of Mt. Pleasant.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.264

Our ride to this place was a very rough one over a succession of steep
hills and deep vallies alternately.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.265

On reaching Pine Hill we saw the pine-tree of this country in great
numbers and of a considerable height, but of no great circumference, none
of them we saw being above one foot in diameter.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.266

On our way to Pine Hill soon after passing Mount Pleasant, we entered
a beautiful rich valley extending from Mt. Pleasant in a south
west direction for about 8 or 9 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.267

This valley is very fertile and well watered, having fine verdant
hills rising on each side of it, affording excellent pasturage.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.268

I named this fine rich vale Campbell Valley in honor of Mrs.
Macquarie.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.269

On our descent from Pine Hill we stopt to look at a ford and small fall
on the Macquarie River three miles to the westward of Mt. Pleasant
; MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.270

we then continued our journey to the latter MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.271

and rode up to the top of it, which is a tableland, and from whence
there is a very fine extensive prospect.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,103.272

We found on the very top of Mount Pleasant several <P_104> cairns or
piles of stones, which have every appearance of having been collected
there by the hands of man.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.273

From the top of Mt. Pleasant we descended on the opposite side
to that we ascended, MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.274

and joined Mrs. M. at half past 2 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.275

I then went into the carriage MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.276

and we all returned home, arriving at Bathurst at 1$$2 past 3 o'clock,
much gratified with our day's excursion.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.277

We dined at 5 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.278

and spent the evening as usual.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.279

Wednesday 10 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.280

After breakfasting this morning, we were visited by three male natives
of the country, all very handsome good looking young men, and whom we
had not seen before.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.281

I gave them presents of slops and tomahawks, MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.282

and to the $best-looking {TEXT:best_looking} and stoutest of them I gave
a piece of yellow cloth in exchange for his mantle, which he presented
me with.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.283

As soon as these 3 natives had taken their leave of us, Mrs.
Macquarie and myself, accompanied by Sir John Jamison and Secry.
Campbell, went on a short water-party on the river in the two new boats
lately sent here from Sydney; Mrs. M. and myself going in
the one called the <font> Water-Mole, <$$font> and the two gentlemen in
the one called the <font> Swan.  <$$font> MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.284

We rowed up and down one of the reaches of the river here about half a
mile long, MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.285

and tried to catch some fish with lines, MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.286

but were not successful, the sun being too bright for the fish biting,
and also on account of the river being at present much lower than usual.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.287

The general breadth of the Macquarie River at Bathurst is between twenty
five and thirty yards; MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.288

but in some other places it contracts itself to one third of that breadth.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.289

Having taken my gun with me on the water, I had an opportunity of
shooting at and killing a large black snake on the left bank of the river.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.290

I also fired at a large hawk, MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.291

but missed it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.292

We remained for an hour on the river MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.293

and then returned home at 1 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,104.294

At 2 p. m. the 3 natives who came into camp in the morning
brought in eleven others to see us, two of whom were grown up men and
the rest boys, no female having come in <P_105> with them either time.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.295

I spoke kindly to them all, MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.296

gave them all presents of black leather caps and tomahawks, and slops
to the grown up men.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.297

I also gave orders that they should have plenty to eat from the public
stores.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.298

They appeared very much pleased MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.299

and went away highly gratified.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.300

This afternoon a large fish was caught in the river which weighed
seventeen pounds; MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.301

and Joseph Big my coachman killed and brought into camp a very fine
large emu, which weighed eighty six pounds!  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.302

We dined at 5 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.303

and played cards as usual between dinner and tea-time.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.304

Thursday 11 May 1815.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.305

Having sent off all our spare heavy baggage two days ago before us
, and having now made all my arrangements at Bathurst, I set out
from it this day at 1 p. m. on my return to Sydney.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.306

Before our departure some of the natives who were with us yesterday came
in to see us MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.307

and remained at Bathurst till we left it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.308

I left Mr. Meehan the Dy. Surveyor General at Bathurst for
the purpose of surveying and laying down on a chart the whole of the lands
fit for cultivation and grazing $I have explored in this new country.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.309

I have also left Mr. Evans the Dy. Surveyor at Bathurst
for the purpose of proceeding on a further tour of discovery for the
distance of one hundred miles in a south west direction from Bathurst
, in hopes of falling in with the Macquarie River in that quarter.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.310

Mr. Evans takes with him 3 men and 2 horses to carry his
provisions on this tour, which he hopes to complete in six weeks.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.311

Dr. Redfern having lost his two caravan horses, which had strayed
away some days before, I had to furnish him with two of the Government
horses to carry home his caravan from Bathurst.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.312

Mrs. M. and myself went all the way from Bathurst to the
Campbell River, where we arrived and took up our ground for the night
at 1$$2 past 2 p. m. MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.313

Dined at 5 MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.314

and spent the evening as usual.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.315

Mr. Meehan came on thus far with us MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.316

and dined with us.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.317

Friday 12 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,105.318

Sent off our baggage early in the morning <P_106> for the Fish River
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.319

and set out ourselves in the carriage at 9 a. m.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.320

Reach Sidmouth Valley at 12 MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.321

and rest there for half an hour.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.322

Continued our journey again MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.323

and arrived at the Fish River at half past 3 p. m. encamping
at this time on the left bank of the river.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.324

Dined at 5 MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.325

and went early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.326

Saturday 13 May 1815.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.327

Sent off our baggage at 7, MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.328

breakfasted at 8, MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.329

and set out on horseback with Mrs. M. at 1$$4 past 9
a. m. MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.330

Halted for near an hour in a deep valley 8 miles from the Fish River to
rest ourselves and cattle, MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.331

and then pursued our journey forwards.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.332

At 3$$4 past 3 p. m. we arrived at Cox's River after
a tiresome and fatiguing journey of 16 miles from the Fish River,
over Clarence's Hilly Range, a very hilly rugged tract of country.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.333

We encamped in a pretty little valley on the left bank of Cox's River,
the grass near our last ground here being all burnt during our absence.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.334

We dined at 5 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.335

and spent the evening as usual.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.336

Sunday 14 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.337

Halted the whole of this day at Cox's River, MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.338

and had all the people assembled after breakfast near my tent for Prayers.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.339

Some of the gentlemen of our party went after Prayers to explore Cox's
River and to endeavour to trace it to the Regents {COM:sic} Glen,
through which it is supposed to bend its course.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.340

They returned an hour before dinner, reporting that the river does bend
its course towards the Regent's Glen as far as they were able to trace it.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.341

Dined as usual at 5 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.342

and went early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.343

Monday 15 May 1815.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.344

Sent off our heavy baggage very early this morning for Cox's Pass
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.345

and set out ourselves in the carriage at 1$$2 past 7 o'clock this morning
, arriving there at 1$$4 past 8; disce. from Cox's River 6 1$$4
miles to the foot of Mount York.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.346

Here we halted and breakfasted, whilst our heavy baggage, carriage, and
horses were conveyed to the top of this tremendous and extraordinary pass,
which is a most steep and difficult aclivity for three quarters of a mile.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,106.347

The whole of the carriages and baggage having been safely conveyed to
the top of the pass, Mrs. M. and myself began <P_107>
to ascend it on foot at 35 minutes past 11 MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.348

and reached to the top of it at 5 minutes after 12.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.349

From the top of the pass we once more feasted our eyes with the grand
and picturesque $prospect of the country below us and which we had
just quitted.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.350

We got into the carriage on the summit of Mount York,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.351

and pursued our journey forwards; arriving at our former ground at the
41 Mile Tree at 2 o'clock; disce. from Cox's River 14 miles.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.352

This place having a black wild appearance I have this day named it
Black-Heath.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.353

It affords however plenty of good water for man and beast and tolerable
good feed for the latter.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.354

We had a very thick heavy fog here all this day, which seemed to threaten
rain, MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.355

but none fell.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.356

We dined at 5 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.357

and went early to bed.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.358

Tuesday 16 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.359

Sent off our heavy baggage early, MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.360

breakfasted at 8, MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.361

and set out in the carriage with Mrs. M. at 1$$2 past
9 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.362

We halted at the place we formerly did to take a second view of
Pitts Amphitheatre, with which we were again very much gratified.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.363

Mrs. M. and myself rode on horseback from the 35th
Mile to the 28th Mile, or Second Depo`t, where we arrived at 1$$2
past 1 p. m. disce. 13 miles from Black-Heath.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.364

The 2d Depo`t is situated in $a very extensive pretty valley, with a
lum of very fine fresh good water, with tolerable good feed for cattle ,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.365

and is exactly halfway between Emu Ford and the Cox River.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.366

I have this day named this place Jamison's Valley in honor of
Sir Jno. Jamison one of our party on the present tour.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.367

Dined at the usual hour MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.368

and went to bed early.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.369

Wednesday 17 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.370

Got up this morning at day-break MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.371

and sent off our baggage immediately.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.372

Breakfasted at 7 MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.373

and set out in $the carriage with Mrs. M. at 8 o'clock;
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.374

and arrived on the summit of the King's Table Land at half past 8 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.375

Mrs. M. and myself here quitted the carriage
MACQUARIE-1815-2,107.376

and mounted our horses for the purpose of viewing and exploring the
beauties of the grand and sublime scenery of this Table Mountain and of
the Prince Regent's Glen, which <P_108> presents a variety of sublime
and grand objects.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.377

There is one water fall at least one thousand feet in height to be seen
here in awful grandeur; MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.378

and there is also a most singular and curious cavern or cave in the face
of one of the hills forming one side of the Glen, and which I have named
Oxley's Grotto in commemoration of Mr. Oxley's <paren> the Surveyor
General <$$paren> having first discovered it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.379

We all descended the hill to see this curious cavern
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.380

and were much gratified with the sight of it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.381

The Prince Regent's Glen extends in length from the King's Table
Land for twenty four miles to Mount York, and until it opens into
the Vale of Clwydd where the Glen terminates to the westward.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.382

From the highest part of the King's Table Land we could see
the whole of the country to the eastward of the Blue Mountains,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.383

and could plainly see and distinguish the several buildings in the town
of Windsor, distant about 30 miles from us in a direct line and bearing
{COM:missing_word} from the highest part of the King's Table Land.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.384

After exploring all the curious parts of the King's Table Land
and Prince Regent's Glen, we pursued our journey, on horseback,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.385

and arrived at Spring Wood at 3 o'clock; the distance from our last
ground being 16 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.386

I stopt for a few minutes at the pile of stones which I have called
Caley's Repulse, situated near the 17th Mile Tree, and from whence
there is a very extensive view to the eastward and southward.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.387

Thursday 18 May.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.388

Sent off our baggage from Spring Field between 7 and 8 o'clock,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.389

and breakfasted at 8 this morning.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.390

I had the initials of my name and this day of the month cut on a very
large blood-wood tree on the south side of the road, close to where
my tent was pitched at Spring Field, to note our departure thence.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.391

This tree was 60 feet high and 14 feet 2 inches in circumference.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.392

We set out in the carriage from Spring Wood at half past 9 o'clock;
MACQUARIE-1815-2,108.393

and having halted at the First Depo`t for about half an hour, we reached
the foot of the Blue Mountains at <P_109> the 3 Mile Tree at 12 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.394

Here we mounted our horses MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.395

and rode across Emu Plains to Emu Ford, which Mrs. M.
and myself crossed on horse-back, it being very safe and good, and the
water of the Nepean River here now not being above six inches high.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.396

We went into our carriage again at Capt. Woodriff's farm on the
Nepean; taking leave here of Mr. Cox, Sir Jno. Jamison,
Mr. Oxley and Mr. Secry. Campbell for the present;
the rest of our party having accompanied us.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.397

From Capt. Woodriff's farm to Mrs. King's we went in the
carriage, MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.398

and arrived at the latter place at half past one o'clock,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.399

and here we found Mr. Hassall waiting for us; it being our
intention to take up our quarters for this night at Mrs. King's
farm.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.400

N. B. I have named the first ascent from Emu Plains
to the Blue Mountains, and which is near a mile long, Emu Hill.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.401

It is very easy to ascend and descend this hill in a carriage, the road
being very good the whole of the way.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.402

Mr. Hassall provided a most excellent dinner for us at Mrs.
King's overseer's house, and to which we sat down at 5 o'clock, drank
tea at 7, and went to bed at 9 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.403

Besides Mr. Hassall, Major Antill, Lieut. Watts, Doctor
Redfern, and Mr. Lewin dined with us.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.404

Friday 19 May 1815.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.405

We got up at day-break, MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.406

and set $out from Mrs. King's farm at 10 minutes after 7 o'clock
this morning, arriving at Government House at Parramatta at 5 minutes
past 9 o'clock; distance from last night's stage being 16 miles, and from
Emu Ford to Mrs. King's farm 6 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.407

At Parramatta Mrs. M. received letters from Mrs.
Redfern giving us most pleasing and highly gratifying accounts of
our beloved darling son's state of health and general improvement.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.408

Mrs. M. had received letters from Mrs. Redfern
twice before to the same effect whilst on our journey back from Bathurst;
the first time between the Campbell River and Sidmouth Valley, and the
second time immediately on our crossing the River Nepean yesterday at
Woodriff's farm.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,109.409

We <P_110> breakfasted at Parramatta, MACQUARIE-1815-2,110.410

and had the pleasure of seeing Capt. Gill of the 46th and
Mr. Wm. Wentworth there, who gave us all the Sydney news.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,110.411

After viewing the several improvements going on at Parramatta, and giving
our horses a rest of 3 1$$2 hours there, we set out at 10 minutes before 1
o'clock from thence for Sydney, where we arrived at half past 2 o'clock,
finding our dear infant, and all our concerns there, entirely to our
satisfaction.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,110.412

Journal of a tour to the Cow Pastures and other parts of the interior

<$$heading>

Monday 3 Ocr. MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.420

Wishing to make myself sufficiently well acquainted with the capabilities
of that tract of country commonly called the Cow Pastures, and thence
how far it may be practicable to tame the wild cattle ranging in the
said tract of country; I set out this morning from Sydney in my carriage,
at 6 o'clock, with a view to satisfy myself in these particulars, having
engaged the following gentlemen to accompany me on this excursion vizt.
1 Mr. Secry. Campbell 2 Paymr. Campbell 46th
Regt. 3 Wm. Cox Esqr. J.P.  4 Mr. Hassall
Supdt. Govt. Stock 5 Jno. Oxley Esqr.
Surveyor Genl. 6 Mr. Meehan Dy. Surveyor
Genl. 7 Brigade Major Antill, and 8 Lieut. Watts A.D.C.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.421

I arrived at Mr. Moore's at Moore Bank, George's River, at 8
o'clock, MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.422

and breakfasted there soon afterwards; sending the carriage on to the
town of Liverpool to remain there for a sufficient number of hours to
bait and rest the horses.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.423

Went up by water from Mr. Moore's to the town of Liverpool,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.424

and having viewed the several improvements going on there, set out from
thence in the carriage at 12 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.425

Travelled through a fine looking open forest country all the way to the
ford of the River Nepean near the Government Hut, MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.426

crossed the ford in the carriage, the water not being above six inches
high, MACQUARIE-1815-2,113.427

and went on about a mile beyond the ford in a southerly <P_114> direction
where I found my tent pitched and all my servants and baggage encamped;
it being a very beautiful situation, close to the bank of the river, and
at the foot of a fine sloping bank about 4 miles east of Mount Hunter.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.428

Here the whole of our party joined MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.429

and we took up our ground for the day at 1$$2 past 2 o'clock.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.430

Found several natives here.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.431

Walked about till dinner time to see the country MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.432

and sat down to a very good dinner at 5 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.433

Drank tea at 7 MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.434

and went to bed at 9 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.435

Wedy. 4 Ocr. MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.436

Breakfast at 8 a. m. MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.437

and set out from camp in half an hour afterwards to inspect the several
farms in the District of Appin, and some of the intermediate ones in
the Districts of Upper Minto and Airds.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.438

Passed through Mr. McArthur's farm of Lower Cambden, where I
stopt for about a quarter of an hour to examine a piece of ground in
rear thereof, which Mrs. McArthur had solicited might be added
to that farm, in consequence of her having by <font> mistake <$$font>
built a small cottage on it.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.439

After having looked at the land and seeing no reasonable objection
thereto, I acquiesced in her request, MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.440

and accordingly directed the Surveyor General to locate and mark out
the piece of ground in question for her, which may be about sixty acres.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.441

From Lower Cambden Farm we proceeded to Mr. Davidson's farm called
Manangle, where we crossed the River Nepean into the District of Airds,
first passing through Horrax's and afterwards thro'several other smaller
farms, some few of which were tolerably well improved, and the crops in
the ground looking well and healthy.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.442

At 11 a. m. entered the District of Appin at Mr.
Uther's farm, which is a very good and a very pretty well improved one on
the slope of a high hill, on the summit of which he has erected his house.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.443

Mr. Uther's crops look well MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.444

and promise to be very good and plentiful.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.445

From Mr. Uther's we passed on to Mr. Hume's farm, which
is also much improved, MACQUARIE-1815-2,114.446

but his crops do not look so well or so promising as the last farm we
passed <P_115> through.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.447

From Mr. Hume's farm we proceeded by a short but very rough road to
the farm of Wm. Broughton Esqr. which he has been pleased
to name Lachlan Vale.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.448

Here he is now building a large one story weather boarded house with two
wings, on a very lofty eminence commanding a very extensive prospect.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.449

Mr. Broughton has cleared a considerable proportion of his farm,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.450

and has some fine looking fields of wheat growing, looking healthy &
promising.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.451

From Mr. Broughton's we proceeded to the next farm belonging to
his brother in law Mr. John Kennedy, within a few hundred yards
of one-another.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.452

Mr. Kennedy has done a great deal in improving his farm;
having cut down much timber, and having now several extensive fields
of very fine looking wheat, with a good farm house and garden.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.453

In consideration of Mr. Kennedy's industry and great exertions to
improve his present farm <paren> 200 acres <$$paren> I have promised him
an additional grant of 100 acres immediately adjoining his present one.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.454

We halted and rested for about half an hour at Mr. Kennedy's
, where we partook of a slight refreshment of bread & wine.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.455

On our arrival at Mr. Kennedy's farm I was much concerned to find
my poor horse Cato very lame.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.456

I discovered early after setting out this morning that he was a little
stiff in his movements, MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.457

but was in hopes it would go off on his getting a little warm.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.458

I was however disappointed, MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.459

for he continued a little stiff all day MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.460

and became very lame at Mr. Kennedy's on getting cool.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.461

I had no other horse to ride however, MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.462

and therefore was forced to use him still.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.463

From Mr. Kennedy's we proceeded to see the farm of Mr.
Sykes about half a mile further to the southward, and at present the
most southern one in Appin.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.464

This man has, with small means, made wonderful exertions, having cleared
and cultivated a large proportion of his farm, MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.465

and there is every appearance of his having an abundant crop of wheat
this season.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,115.466

In consideration of Sykes's industry, I <P_116> have promised him an
addition of seventy acres adjoining immediately his present one, which
will make his whole farm 150 acres.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.467

Sykes's farm is supposed to be about 20 miles distant from the ground
we set out from this morning, MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.468

and we have at least ten miles to ride to our next ground or station at
the Stone-Quarry Creek in the Cow Pastures, whither all our servants and
baggage proceeded this morning at the same time we set out for Appin.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.469

At 2 p. m. set out from Sykes's farm on our return to the
Cow Pastures; MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.470

and crossing the River Nepean at Mr. Riley's farm, and at a very
rough steep pass <paren> which I have named Campbell's Pass in honor of
Mr. Paymaster Campbell <$$paren> we arrived at the Stone Quarry
Creek at 4 p. m. after riding 8 miles over a beautiful
country thither in the Cow Pastures.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.471

Here we found all our servants, cattle, and baggage had arrived safe
about an hour before us.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.472

We saw only 3 or 4 wild bulls in our journey this afternoon between
Campbell's Pass and Stone-Quarry-Creek.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.473

Our ride this day could not have been less than 28 miles.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.474

We sat down at 6 p. m. to a very good dinner,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.475

drank tea, MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.476

and went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.477

Thursday 5 Ocr. MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.478

Breakfasted at 6 o'clock this morning, MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.479

and set out for the Natai Mountains at 7, MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.480

arrive on the farthest verge of the table land of the Natai Mountains
at half past 9 o'clock, disce. by measurement of the perambulator
8 1$$4 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.481

From this table land we had a fine view of a very deep ravine or glen
below us, which leads to the Natai River; the mountains on either side
being an immense height from the bottom, not less than 8 or 900 feet high.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.482

We proceeded on horseback by a circuitous route to this glen for 2 1$$2
miles through very intricate thick forest and brush, at the termination
of which we arrived at the top of a very deep rocky gulley, which in
many places appeared to be almost perpendicular and down which it was
impossible to go on horseback.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,116.483

There being, however, no other way of going to the Natai River, we
determined to leave our horses at the top of this deep gulley <paren>
called by our guide Brimstone <P_117> Gulley <$$paren> and to descend on
foot, guided by Warbey and the native Boodbury.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.484

Mr. Hassall not liking the appearance of the rugged descent,
preferred remaining at the top of the gulley with the servants and horses.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.485

The rest of the party and myself commenced to descend at 1$$2 past 10,
MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.486

and after a most tiresome scrambling walk reached the right bank of
the River Natai at 50 minutes past 11 o'clock, being one hour and 20
minutes in getting thither, the distance by computation from the top of
the gulley to the river being 3 1$$4 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.487

We were all very much fatigued by the time we got to the river
MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.488

and therefore rested there for an hour, where we had each a glass of
cherry brandy and a biscuit to refresh us; Major Antill having carried
with him a pint bottle of this good stuff.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.489

The Natai River is here about the size of George's River, about ten
yards in breadth, MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.490

and is a very pretty stream; having fine open forest land on the left or
opposite bank of it, and which sort of land continues for nine miles along
its banks until this river unites with the Warragombie , by the account
given of it to us by our guide John Warbey.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.491

At ten minutes before 1 p. m. set out from the Natai River
on our return, MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.492

and after a most fatiguing tiresome scrambling walk of 1 hour and 25
minutes, arrived at the top of this tremendous gulley, where we found
Mr. Hassall, our servants, and horses impatiently waiting our
return.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.493

From the near resemblance between them I have named this stupendous
valley or ravine Glencoe.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.494

After getting back to the table-land of the Natai Mountains, we proceeded
on our return to camp by a different route to that we came by from thence
; travelling back by a more northern track, and passing through some very
fine grazing country tollerably well watered, MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.495

but were much surprised to meet so few of the wild cattle during our
excursion outwards and homewards; seldom meeting with a larger herd than
10 or 12 head, and those principally bulls.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.496

We reached our camp at 1$$2 past 5 o'clock, having travelled this day
only 30 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,117.497

<P_118>

I learned this evening on my return to camp for the first time that my
greyhound dog Oscar had been hurt severely hunting a kangaroo two days
since at Mat-tailing, when taken out from thence on Tuesday morning by the
cook and Jack Moore along with Dennison the guide to hunt in that forest.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.499

I was very angry at their taking so daring a liberty.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.500

I ordered the poor animal to be taken particular care of, and to be
carried in one of the carts till he recovers.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.501

Friday 6 Octr. MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.502

Breakfasted at 6 a. m. MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.503

and at 7 o'clock set out from camp to see and examine the tract of
country to the southward of the Stone Quarry Creek called Great Bargo.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.504

At 1$$2 past 9 o'clock, after riding about 8 miles, we arrived at and
crossed the Bargo River, which is a small branch of the Nepean, and
divides Bargo from the proper Cow-Pastures.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.505

On entering Bargo we found the country barren and very bare of feed for
cattle, MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.506

but on advancing a few miles into the country we found both the
land and grazing improve a little but far from being very good.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.507

Here Mr. Oxley and Mr. Moore <paren> with my
permission <$$paren> have large herds of horned cattle grazing;
MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.508

but so many of them have died that these gentlemen intend removing them
immediately from this country.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.509

After halting a few minutes at Mr. Oxley's stock-yard, we proceeded
to that part of Bargo where a great number of trees have been blown
down by some violent tempest, and appears as if they had been felled on
purpose to clear the land.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.510

From this place we proceed to view that part of the great branch of the
River Nepean where the Bargo branch forms a junction with it, and where
the banks of the former are very high and rocky.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.511

The river runs here nearly N. east, and south west.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,118.512

On the opposite side is Little Bargo or Wallamalla, adjoining the District
of Appin, from which it is separated by a very deep creek or gulley.

Mr. Broughton's farm <paren> which he has called Lachlan-Vale
<$$paren> in Appin lies in <P_119> a north east direction from the point
where we thus took our station to view the wild and grand scenery of
the banks of the River Nepean.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.514

At 11 a. m. set out from the banks of the Nepean on our
way back to camp.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.515

Halted again at Mr. Oxley's stock-yard to rest our horses for
half an hour.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.516

Saw here three very young emus belonging to Mr. Oxley's overseer,
not more than 10 or 12 days old.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.517

I desired the stockmen to inform the overseer <paren> who was out in the
bush <$$paren> when he came home that I wished to purchase his 3 young
emus if he was disposed to sell them, and if so to bring them to me to
Sydney soon.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.518

We crossed the Bargo River at the same place as before into the proper
Cow Pastures, MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.519

and returned home to camp by a different and more southerly track than
the one we went out by, arriving in camp at 4 o'clock after a ride of
38 miles.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.520

We saw several small herds of the wild cattle during this day's excursion
, MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.521

and observed many of their tracks even in Bargo.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.522

Saturday 7 Octr. MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.523

Breakfasted at 6 o'clock MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.524

and sent off our baggage from Stone-Quarry Creek at 8, for Mr.
Hassall's farm called Macquarie-Grove on the east side of the River Nepean
, where we next intend to encamp; setting out ourselves immediately
after sending off the baggage, in order to explore the country lying
between the Stone Quarry-Creek more westerly than the route we came by,
and extending to Mount Hunter Creek.  MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.525

On the baggage going away I was concerned to observe that my
poor dog Oscar looked very ill and much reduced in strength.
MACQUARIE-1815-2,119.526

I ordered him to be conveyed carefully in the caravan.
