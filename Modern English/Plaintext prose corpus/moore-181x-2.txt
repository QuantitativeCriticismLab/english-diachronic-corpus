{ED:1818}

<font> August 18th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,1.3

Went to Bath, on my way to Leamington Spa, for the purpose of consulting
Mrs. Lefanu, the only surviving sister of Sheridan, on the subject
of her brother's life: MOORE-181X-2,1.4

meant to call also upon Dr. Parr, with whom I had had a
correspondence on the same subject.  MOORE-181X-2,1.5

<font> 20th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,1.6

Breakfast in the coffee-room.  MOORE-181X-2,1.7

Found Mrs. Lefanu - the very image of Sheridan, having his
features without his carbuncles, and all the light of his eyes without
the illumination of his nose.  MOORE-181X-2,1.8

Her daughter, who has written novels, seems amiable, and looked up to
by father and mother.  MOORE-181X-2,1.9

While I was there, and talking of Sheridan, Dr. Parr entered in
full wig and apron <paren> which he wears as prebendary of St.
Paul's, and not unwilling, of course, to look like a bishop <$$paren>.
MOORE-181X-2,1.10

I had written to him to say Mrs. L. was in his neighbourhood
, MOORE-181X-2,1.11

and he came thus promptly and kindly to visit the sister of his friend;
a powerful old man both in body and mind.  MOORE-181X-2,1.12

Though it was then morning, he drank two glasses and a half of
wine ; and over that, when he was going away, a tumbler of the spa.
MOORE-181X-2,1.13

<font> 21st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,1.14

Dined with Dr. Parr: himself, his wife, and a friend he called'
Jack', a clergyman of +L 1000 a year, who lives in his neighbourhood, very
much devoted to him, and ready at a call to come and write letters for
him, &c. &c.; his own hand being quite illegible <paren>
see what he says of it in preface to'Fox's Characters' <$$paren>.
MOORE-181X-2,1.15

He was very cordial and animated; MOORE-181X-2,1.16

hob-nobbed with me across the table continually; MOORE-181X-2,1.17

told me he had written whole sheets of Greek verses against Big Ben
<paren> the Regent <$$paren>; MOORE-181X-2,1.18

showed them to me: MOORE-181X-2,1.19

the name he designated him by, I saw, was <font> Phuskon, <$$font>
inflated or puffy.  MOORE-181X-2,1.20

Told me they were full of wit, which I took his word for, as they seemed
rather puzzling Greek.  MOORE-181X-2,1.21

<font> 22nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,1.22

Dined with Dr. Parr; the Duke of Grafton, the lion of the day
; young Seymour, a nephew of Lord Hertford's; the Burnes, Lefanus,
&c. &c. MOORE-181X-2,1.23

The doctor was glorious, often very eloquent, always odd;
MOORE-181X-2,1.24

said there was no such man as Homer; that there were various poems tacked
together by a <P_2> collector - that this was now the general opinion
of the learned.  MOORE-181X-2,2.25

He had told me before dinner that we Irish started with a blunder in the
name we gave our St. Patrick, which meant the Devil, his real name
being <font> Succat <$$font>; but the Pagan priests called him <font>
Patric, <$$font> which meant an evil spirit: MOORE-181X-2,2.26

took down Vallancey's'Collectanea'to prove it to me.  MOORE-181X-2,2.27

<font> 23rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,2.28

Left Leamington to return home by way of Birmingham.  MOORE-181X-2,2.29

<font> 24th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,2.30

Arrived at my cottage.  MOORE-181X-2,2.31

Always glad to return to it, and the dear girl who makes it so happy
for me.  MOORE-181X-2,2.32

Found heaps of letters, some of them from poets and authors, who are
the pest of my life: - one sending me a'Serio-comic Drama of Invasion,
in Three Acts including the Vision and the Battle', and referring me
for his poetic credentials to three admirals and'the late comptroller of
the navy'!  Another begging to know whether I was acquainted with 'any
man or woman to whom money was for a time useless', who would venture
+L 100 upon a literary speculation he had in hand.  The third letter
from an eternal Amelia Louisa, announcing to me that her long threatened
MS. was on its way to Wiltshire for my perusal.  MOORE-181X-2,2.33

<font> 26th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,2.34

Answered the author who wanted the'useless money': MOORE-181X-2,2.35

told him I, at least, had none of that description, - very sorry,
&c., &c. MOORE-181X-2,2.36

Wrote also to the poetical grocer's apprentice in Dublin, from whom I
had had a long letter the week before, complaining that I had left his
MSS. when I came away unfolded, and'open to the gaze of every
one'; MOORE-181X-2,2.37

assured him I was sorry for the accident, which was owing to the
carelessness of the person to whom I entrusted them, MOORE-181X-2,2.38

and concluded my letter thus, MOORE-181X-2,2.39

'wishing you all success in that line of life, from which it would
be cruel to divert you by any false hopes of literary eminence, I am,
&c. &c.'MOORE-181X-2,2.40

<font> September 1st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,2.41

My Sheridan task in the morning: interrupted by Bowles, who never comes
amiss; MOORE-181X-2,2.42

the mixture of talent and simplicity in him delightful.  MOORE-181X-2,2.43

His parsonage-house at Brenhill is beautifully situated; MOORE-181X-2,2.44

but he has a good deal frittered away its beauty with grottos, hermitages
, and Shenstonian inscriptions: MOORE-181X-2,2.45

when company is coming he cries,'Here, John, run with the crucifix and
missal to the hermitage, MOORE-181X-2,2.46

and set the fountain going. 'MOORE-181X-2,2.47

His sheep bells are tuned in thirds and fifths; MOORE-181X-2,2.48

but he is an excellent fellow notwithstanding; MOORE-181X-2,2.49

and, if the waters of his inspiration be not those of <P_3> Helicon , they
are at least very <font> sweet <$$font> waters, and to my taste pleasanter
than some that are more strongly impregnated.  MOORE-181X-2,3.50

<font> 2nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,3.51

Received a letter from Power, which will make it necessary for me to go
to town - a most unseasonable interruption.  MOORE-181X-2,3.52

A collection of translations from Meleager sent to me, with a dedication
to myself, written by a Mr. Barnard, a clergyman of Cave Castle,
I think Yorkshire: MOORE-181X-2,3.53

they are done with much elegance; MOORE-181X-2,3.54

I had his MS. to look over.  MOORE-181X-2,3.55

<font> 3rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,3.56

Wrote shoals of letters.  MOORE-181X-2,3.57

This light skirmishing of letterwriting exhausts one's ammunition,
both of time and thought, most cruelly.  MOORE-181X-2,3.58

<font> 7th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,3.59

Took a chaise to Devizes, MOORE-181X-2,3.60

and went from there outside the coach to Marlborough.  MOORE-181X-2,3.61

Saw a man in a foreign pelisse lying across the top of the coach reading
a pamphlet, whom I suspected I knew: MOORE-181X-2,3.62

turned out to be Kit Hutchinson, brother of Lords Hutchinson and
Donoughmore, just come from being made M.P.  for Cork.  MOORE-181X-2,3.63

Was sure he was going to Burdett's, being quite of that kidney;
MOORE-181X-2,3.64

but he was for town.  MOORE-181X-2,3.65

Told me Burdett had made converts in Ireland; among others, Lord Dysart ,
once a rank Tory.  MOORE-181X-2,3.66

Lord D. had frightened that black bigot, Saurin, out of his wits,
by enumerating among the measures that <font> must <$$font> soon be
conceded, Reform and Catholic Emancipation, Saurin near falling off his
horse at the sound.  MOORE-181X-2,3.67

This all owing to Burdett.  MOORE-181X-2,3.68

Hutchinson congratulated me on my triumphant dinner in Dublin,
MOORE-181X-2,3.69

and I returned him the same on his at, Cork; where, by-the-bye, they
hipped and hurraed me as'the Poet, Patriot, and Pride of Ireland '.
MOORE-181X-2,3.70

I am becoming a stock toast at these dinners.  MOORE-181X-2,3.71

Had seen, this very morning, an account of a dinner to Mr. Denny ,
of Cork, where I was drunk as'Poet and Patriot, with great applause '.
MOORE-181X-2,3.72

Took a chaise from Marlborough to Burdett's, - six miles, - Burdett and
Hobhouse out shooting.  MOORE-181X-2,3.73

The Fitzgeralds gone that morning to Sir Charles Hastings;
MOORE-181X-2,3.74

was very sorry I had missed seeing her.  MOORE-181X-2,3.75

The company at Burdett's were the two Hobhouses, Scrope Davies,
a little doctor who attends Lady Burdett, and a Mr. Maxwell.
MOORE-181X-2,3.76

Davies, in fishing that morning, had caught his eye with the hook,
MOORE-181X-2,3.77

but no great harm done.  MOORE-181X-2,3.78

Walked with him and Mr. Maxwell to Ramsbury, to have leeches
applied to the eye.  MOORE-181X-2,3.79

We laughed about Douglas Kinnaird's patriotic dinner at the Horns
at Kennington <paren> 5 <font> s. <$$font> a head <$$paren>
in honour of the'Father of Reform', Major Cartwright.  MOORE-181X-2,3.80

Davies proposed calling Cartwright <P_4>'the Mother of Reform' instead,
MOORE-181X-2,4.81

he <font> is <$$font> a most mischievous old woman.  MOORE-181X-2,4.82

- His taking the'brevia Parliamentaria'of Prynne for'short parliaments',
admirable.  MOORE-181X-2,4.83

Lord Lansdowne told me he was with Lord Holland when the letter containing
this precious bit of erudition arrived.  MOORE-181X-2,4.84

Sat down to dinner without Burdett and Hobhouse.  MOORE-181X-2,4.85

Davies told me that Berkeley Craven called the permission the Jews gave
him to come over from Paris and try his chance at Newmarket for a month,
'the Jews'Pass-over'.  MOORE-181X-2,4.86

A good story of B. Craven and Lord Alvanly, when an accident
happened to their carriage: MOORE-181X-2,4.87

the former getting out to thrash the footman, saw he was an old fellow ,
MOORE-181X-2,4.88

and said,'Your <font> age <$$font> protects you': while Alvanly, who
had advanced towards the postillion with the same intention, seeing he
was an athletic young fellow, turned from him saying, in his waggish
way,'Your <font> youth <$$font> protects you. 'MOORE-181X-2,4.89

Two Miss Burdetts at dinner - nice girls.  MOORE-181X-2,4.90

Burdett's style of living not at all equal to his means, either in
expense or elegance.  MOORE-181X-2,4.91

With such a fortune, he ought to make his private life a sort of
counter-action to the plebeian tendency of his politics; like Washington
, who threw all the graces and courtesies of aristocratic ceremony round
his republican court, and unlike his successor, Jefferson, who seemed to
delight in vulgarising democracy to its lowest pitch.  MOORE-181X-2,4.92

Burdett, a most amiable man, something particularly attaching in his
manner; his gentleness, and almost bashfulness, forming such a contrast
to the violence of his public career.  MOORE-181X-2,4.93

He is, however, but a boy in wisdom, MOORE-181X-2,4.94

and, though he speaks plausibly, he is neither very sensible, nor deeply
informed upon any subject.  MOORE-181X-2,4.95

I speak but from superficial knowledge of him.  MOORE-181X-2,4.96

Hobhouse and other men, who know him better, think much more highly
of him.  MOORE-181X-2,4.97

Music in the evening.  MOORE-181X-2,4.98

Second Miss B. sung very prettily, MOORE-181X-2,4.99

and Davies delighted with the share he himself took in the'Waters
of Babylon', a chant of Purcell's, which he had given Miss B.
MOORE-181X-2,4.100

<font> 8th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,4.101

Walked out, after breakfasting and writing to Bess <paren> my daily task
when away from her <$$paren>, with H., D., and Burdett,
through Lord Aylesbury's forest.  MOORE-181X-2,4.102

Magnificent!  MOORE-181X-2,4.103

could ramble through forest scenery for ever: MOORE-181X-2,4.104

there is less of <font> the world <$$font> there than anywhere
else , except on the ocean, if one was <font> alone <$$font> on it.
MOORE-181X-2,4.105

Talked much of Ireland, with which Burdett is delighted;
MOORE-181X-2,4.106

he told me if I would collect proofs against Lord Castlereagh's ministry
in Ireland, and draw up resolutions, he would move them in the House,
and impeach him; MOORE-181X-2,4.107

but the thing is gone by.  MOORE-181X-2,4.108

He is evidently prejudiced against Grattan, MOORE-181X-2,4.109

and did not show quite a right feeling on the late outrageous attack
upon that noble old man in Dublin; MOORE-181X-2,4.110

he wants <paren> what so many want <$$paren> <P_5> candour.
MOORE-181X-2,5.111

Curran evidently the favourite of the whole party; MOORE-181X-2,5.112

and, no doubt, was far above Grattan in wit and genius, but still further
<font> below <$$font> him in real wisdom and goodness.  MOORE-181X-2,5.113

I told stories of Curran which made them laugh a good deal; his adventure
at Oxford with Reinagle and his man John; his speech to the Englishman
who was laughing at him on the top of the coach,'May God Almighty
never humanise your countenance, you odious baboon': and many others.
MOORE-181X-2,5.114

<font> 9th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,5.115

Walked to Ramsbury at seven in the morning, MOORE-181X-2,5.116

and took the Marlborough coach.  MOORE-181X-2,5.117

Arrived in London at half-past six in the evening, MOORE-181X-2,5.118

and dined at the George in Coventry Street, MOORE-181X-2,5.119

and found that Power had taken lodgings for me in Duke Street, 33,
and that my brother-in-law, Scully, was in town.  MOORE-181X-2,5.120

<font> 10th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,5.121

Called on the Longmans: the'Fudges'soon going to press for another
edition; MOORE-181X-2,5.122

they are very anxious for the'Fudges'in London, MOORE-181X-2,5.123

but I am still doubtful as to the good taste of following up the blow.
MOORE-181X-2,5.124

<font> 11th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,5.125

Mr. Hamilton the printer, who was once proprietor of the' Critical
Review', called upon me with a letter of introduction from Wilkie.
MOORE-181X-2,5.126

Came to propose to me to be editor of a new Monthly Review;
MOORE-181X-2,5.127

explained his plan, MOORE-181X-2,5.128

and said, with a true trading spirit, that he <font> intended <$$font>
the politics of the work should be Whiggish, <font> because <$$font>
those appeared to be becoming the <font> fashionable <$$font> politics
of the day.  MOORE-181X-2,5.129

I declined, of course; MOORE-181X-2,5.130

told him that, as long as the little fancy and originality I possess
remained, I should not take to reviewing; but when I become invalided,
I shall look upon the editorship of a review as a good sort of Greenwich
Hospital to retire to.  MOORE-181X-2,5.131

Called at Carpenter's, MOORE-181X-2,5.132

and had the triumph of telling him the liberal conduct of the Longmans
to me about the profits of the'Fudges'; such a contrast to his own!
MOORE-181X-2,5.133

Dined at the George with Scully, MOORE-181X-2,5.134

and went alone to the Haymarket Theatre: MOORE-181X-2,5.135

'Honeymoon'and the'Green Man'; MOORE-181X-2,5.136

Major Dumpling in the latter by Tokeby excellent; MOORE-181X-2,5.137

a pretty girl, Miss E. Blanchard, who moves her head like a
mandarin, when $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} near stopping.  MOORE-181X-2,5.138

Why are there not more pretty girls on the stage?  MOORE-181X-2,5.139

Beauty is at least the next thing to first-rate acting; MOORE-181X-2,5.140

and I agree with that French actress who, when told that the'premier
principe'of her art was attention to costume, answered, <font>'
le premier principe d'une femme c'est de paroitre jolie'.  <$$font>
MOORE-181X-2,5.141

<font> 12th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,5.142

Went in the evening to the English Opera; MOORE-181X-2,5.143

could not stand its dullness, MOORE-181X-2,5.144

and set off to the Coburg Theatre - pretty, gay-looking house, but <P_6>
duller still than the other.  MOORE-181X-2,6.145

Went back to the Lyceum, MOORE-181X-2,6.146

and attained the <font> summum bonum <$$font> of stupidity.
MOORE-181X-2,6.147

Afterwards met Scully and Woolriche at the York, MOORE-181X-2,6.148

and finished the night with oysters and brandy.  MOORE-181X-2,6.149

<font> 13th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,6.150

Met Scully at breakfast at the George, MOORE-181X-2,6.151

and set off with him walking for Hornsey, in order to visit the grave
of my poor Barbara, and report to Bessy whether it was kept as neat and
sacred as she could wish.  MOORE-181X-2,6.152

Felt it less this time than I did some months since, when I went to the
church-yard alone and had nothing to divert me from the melancholy train
of thinking it led to.  MOORE-181X-2,6.153

That space which is left, upon, the stone for <font> other <$$font>
names is a frightful blank.  MOORE-181X-2,6.154

I showed him the cottage, at the foot of Muswell Hill where we lost this
dear child, and to the gate of which she had so often run to meet me.
MOORE-181X-2,6.155

We dined at the Sun at Highgate, MOORE-181X-2,6.156

and walked home in the evening.  MOORE-181X-2,6.157

<font> 14th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,6.158

Started in the coach for Devizes at six o'clock; my neighbour
McDonald <paren> who had secured the places for us <$$paren>, his
friend Capt. Davis, and myself. 'inside, and Scully outside.
MOORE-181X-2,6.159

<font> 15th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,6.160

Lowering morning, MOORE-181X-2,6.161

- bad cottage weather; MOORE-181X-2,6.162

walked out with Scully to show him the beautiful valley behind us,
MOORE-181X-2,6.163

but the rain came on, MOORE-181X-2,6.164

and we returned.  MOORE-181X-2,6.165

<font> 25th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,6.166

In the garden all day; MOORE-181X-2,6.167

delicious weather.  MOORE-181X-2,6.168

At my Sheridan task from ten till three; MOORE-181X-2,6.169

so hard to narrate familiar events eloquently - MOORE-181X-2,6.170

I often wish Sheridan, Miss Linley, and Major Mathews at the devil.
MOORE-181X-2,6.171

This would have been a day for poetry - not tame, dull, business-like
prose; MOORE-181X-2,6.172

and yet this have I lost all this most poetical summer.
MOORE-181X-2,6.173

Wrote a few lines of the epitaph for poor Joe Atkinson before breakfast.
MOORE-181X-2,6.174

In the evening walked with Bessy to drink tea at the Hughes's, where
they were preparing a harvest supper for their men: MOORE-181X-2,6.175

found, on my return home, a note from Mr. Money, inviting me to
dinner next day to meet William Linley.  MOORE-181X-2,6.176

<font> 26th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,6.177

Finished my epitaph upon poor Joe.  MOORE-181X-2,6.178

Wrote some of Sheridan.  MOORE-181X-2,6.179

Went to dinner at Money's: MOORE-181X-2,6.180

none but he, Linley, and myself.  MOORE-181X-2,6.181

Strange that Linley did not know Mathews was married at the time he was
paying court to his sister.  MOORE-181X-2,6.182

Sheridan persuaded the Linleys to part with their shares in Drury Lane
for annuities which were never paid: MOORE-181X-2,6.183

he thus got the disposal of everything, the sale of private boxes,
&c. all into his own hands.  MOORE-181X-2,6.184

Told some other stories of S.'s trickery in money matters,
MOORE-181X-2,6.185

but seemed willing to acquit him of any low, premeditated design in
these various shifts and contrivances.  MOORE-181X-2,6.186

Told me that one day at S.'s house, before poor Tom went abroad, the
servant in passing threw down the plate-warmer with a crash, which
startled Tom's nerves a good deal.  MOORE-181X-2,6.187

Sheridan, after scolding most furiously the servant, who stood pale
and frightened, at last exclaimed,'and how many plates have you broke?
'MOORE-181X-2,6.188

'Oh!  not one sir', answered the <P_7> fellow, delighted to vindicate
himself; MOORE-181X-2,7.189

'and you, damned fool <paren> said S. <$$paren>, have you made
all that noise for nothing? 'MOORE-181X-2,7.190

<font> 29th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,7.191

One day so like another, that there is little by which to distinguish
their features; MOORE-181X-2,7.192

and these are the happiest; true cottage days, tranquil and industrious
; with no other alloy than the weak state of my sweet Bessy's health ,
which I trust in Heaven, after she has had her little one, will improve.
MOORE-181X-2,7.193

Pursued my task all day in the garden, MOORE-181X-2,7.194

the evening most delicious; MOORE-181X-2,7.195

seemed to be the last soft farewell of summer.  MOORE-181X-2,7.196

<font> 30th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,7.197

Ditto for the most part.  MOORE-181X-2,7.198

Another bright parting glance of summer in the evening; MOORE-181X-2,7.199

it surely must be the last.  MOORE-181X-2,7.200

<font> October 1st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,7.201

Crowe called, MOORE-181X-2,7.202

and found me in the garden at work.  MOORE-181X-2,7.203

I thought he was come to pay his long-promised visit, MOORE-181X-2,7.204

but he was on his way to dine at Devizes.  MOORE-181X-2,7.205

Told me he remembered the first Mrs. Sheridan when Miss Linley:
MOORE-181X-2,7.206

there was a degree of sternness, he said, mixed with the beauty
of her features; like her father, who was ill-tempered looking.
MOORE-181X-2,7.207

Tom resembled her very much.  MOORE-181X-2,7.208

This I have heard from every one.  MOORE-181X-2,7.209

Walked with Crowe on his way through the fields.  MOORE-181X-2,7.210

<font> 2nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,7.211

Set off, between two and three, to walk to Bowles's to dinner.
MOORE-181X-2,7.212

Bessy and the little ones saw me part of the way.  MOORE-181X-2,7.213

Met on the Calne road a riding party, consisting of Lord Lansdowne, the
Ordes <paren> Mrs. Orde, a very engaging little woman, sister to
Lady Oxford <$$paren>, and Mr. Wellesley.  MOORE-181X-2,7.214

Lord L. said the Hollands were coming on Sunday: MOORE-181X-2,7.215

asked me to fix a day to dine; MOORE-181X-2,7.216

fixed Wednesday.  MOORE-181X-2,7.217

Slept at Bowles's.  MOORE-181X-2,7.218

<font> 3rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,7.219

Dreadfully rainy day.  MOORE-181X-2,7.220

After much doubting and watching of the weather determined on staying,
MOORE-181X-2,7.221

and wrote home to Bessy.  MOORE-181X-2,7.222

Linley produced Greene's'Andhems'.  MOORE-181X-2,7.223

I think I surprised him a little by singing them at sight with him,
and tolerably well too.  MOORE-181X-2,7.224

We talked away all the morning as incessant as the rain.
MOORE-181X-2,7.225

Some good stories.  MOORE-181X-2,7.226

Sheridan, the first time he met Tom, after the marriage of the latter,
seriously angry with him; told him he had made his will, and had cut
him off with a shilling.  MOORE-181X-2,7.227

Tom said he was, indeed, very sorry, MOORE-181X-2,7.228

and immediately added,'You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} happen to have the
shilling about you now, sir, do you? 'MOORE-181X-2,7.229

Old S. burst out laughing, MOORE-181X-2,7.230

and they became friends again.  MOORE-181X-2,7.231

<P_8>

<font> 4th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,8.233

Came home, MOORE-181X-2,8.234

and found my dearest Bessy very tired after her walk from church.
MOORE-181X-2,8.235

She had been receiving the sacrament, MOORE-181X-2,8.236

and never did a purer heart prostrate itself before the altar.
MOORE-181X-2,8.237

In the note she wrote me to Bowles's the day before, she said,'I am
sorry I am not to see you before I go to church. 'MOORE-181X-2,8.238

In the evening tried over a new volume of Latrobe's sacred music, which
Mrs. Bowles had lent me.  MOORE-181X-2,8.239

<font> 5th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,8.240

Wrote to Mr. Grenville, to ask him for any letters or papers he
may have of Sheridan's.  MOORE-181X-2,8.241

My little Anastasia repeated to me a pretty child's poem she had learnt,
beginning,'Twinkle, twinkle, little star'.  MOORE-181X-2,8.242

I wrote one for her the other day, which she repeats:'Little Mayfly,
the $sun $'s {TEXT:sun's} in the sky', &c. &c.
MOORE-181X-2,8.243

Played a game of cribbage with Bessy after dinner, MOORE-181X-2,8.244

and lost sixpence to her.  MOORE-181X-2,8.245

Read some of S.'s speeches before I went to bed.  MOORE-181X-2,8.246

<font> 7th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,8.247

Quarter before six, Joy called upon me, in his father's carriage, to
take me to Bowood to dinner.  MOORE-181X-2,8.248

Brought Bessy a beautiful Guernsey lily, a superfine thing; originally,
he says, of Japan.  MOORE-181X-2,8.249

A ship from Japan had been wrecked on the coast of Guernsey,
MOORE-181X-2,8.250

and, having quantities of lilies aboard, they were cast among the sand ,
MOORE-181X-2,8.251

and the following year these splendid flowers appeared.
MOORE-181X-2,8.252

The company at Bowood, besides those there on Sunday, the Hollands,
Allen, Marsh, Henry Fox, Wellesley; MOORE-181X-2,8.253

and Charles Fox and Fazakerly arrived in the evening.  MOORE-181X-2,8.254

Sat near Lady Holland at dinner; MOORE-181X-2,8.255

very gracious; MOORE-181X-2,8.256

has really shown a sincere anxiety about my Bermuda misfortune.
MOORE-181X-2,8.257

Talked of poor Monk Lewis: MOORE-181X-2,8.258

his death was occasioned by taking emetics for sea-sickness, in spite
of the advice of those about him.  MOORE-181X-2,8.259

He died lying on the deck.  MOORE-181X-2,8.260

When he was told all hope was over, he sent his man down below for pen,
ink, and paper; MOORE-181X-2,8.261

asked him to lend him his hat; MOORE-181X-2,8.262

and upon that, as he lay, wrote a codicil to his will.  MOORE-181X-2,8.263

Few men, once so talked of, have ever produced so little sensation by
their death.  MOORE-181X-2,8.264

He was ruining his Negroes in Jamaica, they say, by indulgence, for which
they suffered severely as soon as his back was turned; MOORE-181X-2,8.265

but he has enjoined it to his heirs, as one of the conditions of holding
his estate, that the Negroes were to have three additional holidays in
the year; MOORE-181X-2,8.266

and has left a sort of programme of the way these holidays are to be
celebrated, - the hour when the overseer is to sound his shell to summon
them together, the toasts, &c: MOORE-181X-2,8.267

the first toast to be'the Lady Frederica, Duchess of York':
MOORE-181X-2,8.268

so like poor Lewis.  MOORE-181X-2,8.269

Had a good <P_9> deal of conversation with Lord Holland in the evening
about Sheridan.  MOORE-181X-2,9.270

Told me that one remarkable characteristic of S., and which
accounted for many of his inconsistencies, was the high, ideal system
he had formed of a sort of impracticable perfection in honour, virtue,
&c, anything short of which he seemed to think not worth aiming at;
MOORE-181X-2,9.271

and thus consoled himself for the extreme laxity of his practice by
the impossibility of satisfying or coming up to the sublime theory he
had formed.  MOORE-181X-2,9.272

Hence the most romantic professions of honour and independence
were coupled with conduct of the meanest and most swindling kind;
MOORE-181X-2,9.273

hence, too, prudery and morality were always on his lips, while his
actions were one series of debauchery and libertinism.  MOORE-181X-2,9.274

This was all very amusing, MOORE-181X-2,9.275

and I was rather sorry I had arranged to return home at night.
MOORE-181X-2,9.276

Everybody pressed me to stay, MOORE-181X-2,9.277

and I was very near having reason to repent my going; MOORE-181X-2,9.278

for, when we were about a mile from the house, Joy's coachman drove off
the road and down a bank, MOORE-181X-2,9.279

and overset the carriage.  MOORE-181X-2,9.280

The crash was tremendous, MOORE-181X-2,9.281

for three of the glasses were up; MOORE-181X-2,9.282

but none of us were hurt, except Joy's man a little bruised in the hip,
and my arm slightly strained.  MOORE-181X-2,9.283

Lord Lansdowne's keeper happened luckily to be passing, MOORE-181X-2,9.284

and helped us to raise the carriage.  MOORE-181X-2,9.285

I walked home, MOORE-181X-2,9.286

and did not arrive till past one o'clock.  MOORE-181X-2,9.287

In speaking of Sheridan's eloquence, Lord H. said that the
overstrained notions he had of perfection were very favourable to his
style of oratory in giving it a certain elevation of tone and dignity
of thought.  MOORE-181X-2,9.288

Mr. Fox thought his Westminster Hall speech, trumpery,
MOORE-181X-2,9.289

and used to say it spoiled the style of Burke, who was delighted with it.
MOORE-181X-2,9.290

Certainly in the report I have read of it, it seems most trashy bombast.
MOORE-181X-2,9.291

At Holland House, where he was often latterly, Lady H. told me
he used to take a bottle of wine and a book up to bed with him always;
the <font> former <$$font> alone intended for use.  MOORE-181X-2,9.292

In the morning he breakfasted in bed, MOORE-181X-2,9.293

and had a little rum or brandy with his tea or coffee; MOORE-181X-2,9.294

made his appearance between one and two, MOORE-181X-2,9.295

and pretending important business, used to set out for town,
MOORE-181X-2,9.296

but regularly stopped at the Adam and Eve public-house for a dram.
MOORE-181X-2,9.297

There was indeed a long bill run up by him at the Adam and Eve, which
Lord H. had to pay.  MOORE-181X-2,9.298

<font> 9th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,9.299

Received a long letter from Lord Byron, in which he sends me two stanzas
of the Beppo-ish poem he is about, called'Don Juan'.  MOORE-181X-2,9.300

<font> 15th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,9.301

In the garden all the morning.  MOORE-181X-2,9.302

Visit from Miss Hughes and the Misses Crowe: MOORE-181X-2,9.303

showed them engravings of Lord Byron: MOORE-181X-2,9.304

they remarked that his not wearing whiskers gave him a singular look.
MOORE-181X-2,9.305

From thence the transition to <font> my <$$font> unwhiskered <font>
face <$$font> very obvious; MOORE-181X-2,9.306

and, <font> per saltum, <$$font> from me up to Buonaparte, who is also
without whiskers.  MOORE-181X-2,9.307

<P_10>

<font> 18th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,10.309

As the morning was fine, set out to Bowood to see Rogers;
MOORE-181X-2,10.310

caught him in the garden, on the way to Bowles's; MOORE-181X-2,10.311

walked with him; MOORE-181X-2,10.312

talked much about Sheridan.  MOORE-181X-2,10.313

In a second search through the papers they have found the Acts of'
The Foresters': some letters too of the Prince's, which, of course
, I must see, though I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} make use of them.
MOORE-181X-2,10.314

Sheridan once told Rogers of a scene that occurred in a French theatre
in 1772, where two French officers stared a good deal at his wife, and
S., not knowing a word of French, could do nothing but put his
arms a-kimbo and look bluff and defying at them, which they, not knowing
a word of English, could only reply to by the very same attitude and look.
MOORE-181X-2,10.315

He once mentioned to Rogers that he was aware he ought to have made a
love scene between Charles and Maria in the'School for Scandal'; and
<font> would <$$font> have done it, but that the actors who played the
parts were not able to do such a scene justice.  MOORE-181X-2,10.316

Left Bowles's at half-past two.  MOORE-181X-2,10.317

In passing through Bowood for home I was caught by Lady Lansdowne,
Lord Auckland, &c. &c. MOORE-181X-2,10.318

She begged me to stay for dinner; MOORE-181X-2,10.319

said Lady Bath <paren> who was going next day <$$paren> wished very much
to know me.  MOORE-181X-2,10.320

Consented: MOORE-181X-2,10.321

a man and horse sent for my things.  MOORE-181X-2,10.322

Sat with Rogers in his room till dinner.  MOORE-181X-2,10.323

Told me that Beckford <paren> <font> the <$$font> Beckford <$$paren>
is delighted with'Lalla Rookh'; MOORE-181X-2,10.324

heard so from Beckford himself in the spring, when I met him at Rogers's
in town, and he was all raptures about it.  MOORE-181X-2,10.325

Beckford wishes me to go to Fonthill with R.; anxious that I should
look over his'Travels'<paren> which were printed some years ago, but
afterwards suppressed by him <$$paren>, and prepare them for the press.
MOORE-181X-2,10.326

Rogers supposes he would give me something magnificent for it - a thousand
pounds, perhaps; MOORE-181X-2,10.327

but if he were to give me a hundred times that sum I would not have my
name coupled with his.  MOORE-181X-2,10.328

<font> 19th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,10.329

Had promised Rogers, who was coming to me this morning, to meet him
half way.  MOORE-181X-2,10.330

Mrs. Phipps, upon whom I called as I went, came out with
me in order to get a glimpse of <font>'Memory <$$font> Rogers'.
MOORE-181X-2,10.331

He and I walked to my cottage; much delighted with the scenery around;
MOORE-181X-2,10.332

said he preferred the valley and village before us to the laid-out
grounds of Bowood.  MOORE-181X-2,10.333

Showed him some of my Sheridan papers.  MOORE-181X-2,10.334

He mentioned'Memoirs of Jackson'of Exeter, written by himself, which he
saw in MS. some years ago, and in which he remembered there was
a most glowing description of his pupil, Miss Linley, standing singing
by his side, and so beautiful that'you might think you were looking into
the face of an angel'.  MOORE-181X-2,10.335

<font> 21st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,10.336

Walked to meet Rogers, who said he would call upon me.
MOORE-181X-2,10.337

Talked chiefly of Sheridan.  MOORE-181X-2,10.338

Told me several anecdotes, some of which I have <P_11> written down in
my notebook as fit to use; MOORE-181X-2,11.339

the rest practical jokes, not easily tellable: - His strewing the hall
or passage with plates and dishes, and knives and forks stuck between
them, and then tempting Tickell <paren> with whom he was always at
some frolic or other <$$paren> to pursue him into the thick of them:
MOORE-181X-2,11.340

Tickell fell among them MOORE-181X-2,11.341

and was almost cut to pieces, MOORE-181X-2,11.342

and next day, in vowing vengeance to Lord John Townshend against
S. for this trick, he added <paren> with the true spirit of an
amateur in practical jokes <$$paren>,'but it was amazingly well done '.
MOORE-181X-2,11.343

Another time, when the women <paren> Mrs. Crewe, Mrs.
Tickell, &c. <$$paren> had received the gentlemen after dinner
in disguises, which puzzled them to make out <font> which <$$font>
was <font> which, <$$font> the gentlemen one day sent to the ladies
to come downstairs to <font> them <$$font> in the dining-room.
MOORE-181X-2,11.344

The ladies, upon entering, saw them all dressed as Turks, holding bumpers
in their hands, MOORE-181X-2,11.345

and after looking amongst them and saying,'This is Mr. Crewe'
;'No, this is he'; &c. &c, they heard a laugh at the door,
MOORE-181X-2,11.346

and there they saw all the gentlemen in <font> propriis personis;
<$$font> MOORE-181X-2,11.347

for $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} the maids they had dressed up in Turkish habits.
MOORE-181X-2,11.348

S. was always at these tricks in country houses.
MOORE-181X-2,11.349

He has been known to send a man and horse eight miles for a piece of
crape, MOORE-181X-2,11.350

and people were always kept in expectation of some forthcoming frolic.
MOORE-181X-2,11.351

<font> 22nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,11.352

Walked at twelve o'clock towards Bowood to meet Rogers.
MOORE-181X-2,11.353

Met R. at the park-gate, MOORE-181X-2,11.354

and came on towards the cottage.  MOORE-181X-2,11.355

Talked of the Scotch novels.  MOORE-181X-2,11.356

When Wilkie the painter was taking his portraits of Scott's family,
the eldest daughter said to him,'We $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what to
think of those novels.  MOORE-181X-2,11.357

We have access to all papa's papers.  MOORE-181X-2,11.358

He has no particular study; MOORE-181X-2,11.359

writes everything in the midst of us all; MOORE-181X-2,11.360

and yet we never have seen a single scrap of the MS. of any of
these novels; MOORE-181X-2,11.361

but still we have <font> one <$$font> reason for thinking them his,
MOORE-181X-2,11.362

and that is, that they are the only works published in Scotland of which
copies are not presented to papa. 'MOORE-181X-2,11.363

The reason <font> against <$$font> is stronger than the reason <font>
for: <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,11.364

Scott gave his honour to the Prince Regent they were not his;
MOORE-181X-2,11.365

and Rogers <font> heard <$$font> him do the same to Sheridan, who asked
him, with some degree of <font> brusquerie, <$$font> whether he was the
author of them.  MOORE-181X-2,11.366

All this rather confirms me in my first idea that they are <font> not
<$$font> Scott's.  MOORE-181X-2,11.367

<font> 23rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,11.368

Crowe to breakfast.  MOORE-181X-2,11.369

Walked over with Crowe to call at Bowood; MOORE-181X-2,11.370

met Rogers, who returned with us there.  MOORE-181X-2,11.371

Saw Lord Lansdowne - <font> kind <$$font> and <font> amiable as usual.
<$$font> MOORE-181X-2,11.372

I find he gains upon.  one's heart in the true way, <font> piano e sano.
<$$font> MOORE-181X-2,11.373

Talked of Sir W. Jones, who died at forty-seven;
MOORE-181X-2,11.374

and so did Addison.  MOORE-181X-2,11.375

Addison, according to the tradition of Holland House, used, when
composing, to walk up and down the long gallery there, with a bottle
of wine at each end of it, which he finished during the operation.
MOORE-181X-2,11.376

There is a little <P_12> white house, too, near the turnpike, to which
he used to retire when the Countess was particularly troublesome.
MOORE-181X-2,12.377

Returned home to dinner at four; MOORE-181X-2,12.378

went to bed early, MOORE-181X-2,12.379

and was called up by Bessy at half-past eleven o'clock:
MOORE-181X-2,12.380

sent for the midwife, who arrived between one and two, MOORE-181X-2,12.381

and at a quarter before four my darling Bessy was safely delivered of
a son <paren> and heir <font> in partibus <$$paren>, <$$font> to my
unspeakable delight, MOORE-181X-2,12.382

for never had I felt half such anxiety about her.  MOORE-181X-2,12.383

I walked about the parlour by myself, like one distracted;
sometimes stopping to pray, sometimes opening the door to listen;
MOORE-181X-2,12.384

and never was gratitude more fervent than that with which I knelt down
to thank God for the dear girl's safety, when all was over - <paren>
the maid, by the by, very near catching me on my knees <$$paren>.
MOORE-181X-2,12.385

Went to bed at six o'clock.  MOORE-181X-2,12.386

<font> 24th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,12.387

Rose at half-past nine.  MOORE-181X-2,12.388

Bessy and the little hero surprisingly well.  MOORE-181X-2,12.389

<font> 27th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,12.390

Dined at Bowood.  MOORE-181X-2,12.391

Had some conversation with Lord Lansdowne before dinner.
MOORE-181X-2,12.392

Talked of the impeachment of Hastings; MOORE-181X-2,12.393

asked him his impression on the subject.  MOORE-181X-2,12.394

He said he looked upon Hastings as an irregular man, using violent
means for purposes, which perhaps, nothing but irregular and violent
means would answer, as his command and situation in India were of such
a particularly difficult and embarrassing nature.  MOORE-181X-2,12.395

Talked of the great question about the abatement of an impeachment by
dissolution of Parliament, upon which the lawyers and statesmen divided
, MOORE-181X-2,12.396

and the latter had the best of it in every respect: MOORE-181X-2,12.397

Erskine too much of a lawyer not to join his craft on this occasion.
MOORE-181X-2,12.398

When Burke was told of Erskine's opinion,'What! 'said he,'a nisi-prius
lawyer give an opinion on an impeachment!  MOORE-181X-2,12.399

as well might a rabbit, that breeds fifty times in the year, pretend to
understand the gestation of an elephant'.  MOORE-181X-2,12.400

How admirable this is!  MOORE-181X-2,12.401

<font> 29th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,12.402

Have got Sheridan fairly married at last, MOORE-181X-2,12.403

and now enter into a new region of his life, for which my <font> viatica
<$$font> are not half so abundant as in the early part of the journey.
MOORE-181X-2,12.404

<font> 30th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,12.405

Worked a little at'Sheridan'; MOORE-181X-2,12.406

badly off for materials; MOORE-181X-2,12.407

almost reduced to Watkins.  MOORE-181X-2,12.408

Received the Edinburgh Magazine <paren> Blackwood's <$$paren> for
November.  MOORE-181X-2,12.409

A malicious and canting article in it against myself, in which the fellow
has both misrepresented and misquoted my song of'The Legacy', which he
says I have put into the mouth of a'dying poet'.  MOORE-181X-2,12.410

What a blockhead!  MOORE-181X-2,12.411

I find I am no gainer by the change of Ministry in this magazine:
MOORE-181X-2,12.412

used to be praised in it before Murray came into power:
MOORE-181X-2,12.413

$how $'s {TEXT:how's} this?  MOORE-181X-2,12.414

Dined with -, MOORE-181X-2,12.415

very dull; MOORE-181X-2,12.416

but he gave us claret; MOORE-181X-2,12.417

<font> et c'est toujours quelque chose; <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,12.418

dulness and port together are the devil.  MOORE-181X-2,12.419

<P_13>

<font> November 4th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,13.421

Received two most civil and anxious letters from that great'Bibliopola
Tryphon', Murray, expressing his regret at the article against me in
'Blackwood', and his resolution to give up all concern in it if it
contained any more such personalities.  MOORE-181X-2,13.422

Read, with a shock I have hardly ever felt before, the account of that
great and amiable man $Romilly $'s {TEXT:Romilly's} death, in the papers.
MOORE-181X-2,13.423

He has left a void behind in public life that no one can fill up.
MOORE-181X-2,13.424

But what a splendid martyrdom to conjugal love!  MOORE-181X-2,13.425

She was too, if I mistake not, a simple, gay, <font> unlearned <$$font>
woman; no <font> Blue; <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,13.426

no, if she <font> had <$$font> been, such a man as Romilly could not
have loved her so much.  MOORE-181X-2,13.427

<font> 6th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,13.428

While I was at dinner Lord Lansdowne called; MOORE-181X-2,13.429

was denied to him; MOORE-181X-2,13.430

but he asked to write a note, MOORE-181X-2,13.431

and the maid was showing him upstairs, MOORE-181X-2,13.432

so in my alarm lest he should surprise Bess, I made my appearance,
MOORE-181X-2,13.433

and brought him into the parlour, where the little things and I were in
the very thick of boiled beef and carrots.  MOORE-181X-2,13.434

He sat for some time; MOORE-181X-2,13.435

talked of poor Romilly; MOORE-181X-2,13.436

said he had hardly slept since he heard of the circumstances;
MOORE-181X-2,13.437

wondered they had not applied leeches.  MOORE-181X-2,13.438

I asked whether R.'s affection for his wife was so very strong as to
account for this effect; MOORE-181X-2,13.439

he said it was; but Romilly was a stern, reserved sort of man, and she
was the only person in the world to whom he wholly unbent and unbosomed
himself; MOORE-181X-2,13.440

when he lost her, therefore, the very vent of his heart was stopped up.
MOORE-181X-2,13.441

<font> 14th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,13.442

Received American editions of different works of mine; MOORE-181X-2,13.443

'Lalla Rookh'is the third.  MOORE-181X-2,13.444

Another poem from Miss L- W-, the young poetess of fourteen, who
before addressed something to me; a wild-brained little thing.

<paren> Sunday <$$paren>.  MOORE-181X-2,13.447

This day my own excellent Bessy has completed her twenty-fifth year:
MOORE-181X-2,13.448

she is much $better $this {TEXT:bette_rthis} morning.  MOORE-181X-2,13.449

Heaven send her many happy returns of this anniversary!
MOORE-181X-2,13.450

<font> 18th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,13.451

Walked my dear Bessy for the first time into the garden;
MOORE-181X-2,13.452

the day delightful.  MOORE-181X-2,13.453

She went round to all her flower beds to examine their state,
MOORE-181X-2,13.454

for she has every little leaf in the garden by heart.  MOORE-181X-2,13.455

Took a ramble afterwards by myself through the Valley of Chitoway,
and the fields.  MOORE-181X-2,13.456

<font> 21st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,13.457

Walked to Bowood, to call on Lord Lansdowne.  MOORE-181X-2,13.458

Always kind and agreeable.  MOORE-181X-2,13.459

Told him I was going to town.  MOORE-181X-2,13.460

He said he could have taken me in the middle of the week;
MOORE-181X-2,13.461

but, unluckily, I have engaged myself to go with Macdonald, who has
taken our places in the coach.  MOORE-181X-2,13.462

<P_14>

<font> 23rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,14.464

Left home at eleven; MOORE-181X-2,14.465

in coach about twelve.  MOORE-181X-2,14.466

A jolly old farmer joined us part of the way; MOORE-181X-2,14.467

talked of the late elections; MOORE-181X-2,14.468

said he had given a plumper to, Methuen because he had'flung the bill
<paren> for the additional income of the Princes <$$paren> out of the
house'; at the same time showing by his gesture that he understood that
Methuen had actually thrown the bill out of doors.  MOORE-181X-2,14.469

Upon finding Macdonald was in the navy, told him he had also when young
thought of going aboard a merchant ship; but his father said,'$Do $n't
{TEXT:Don't} go with <font> they, <$$font> boy; MOORE-181X-2,14.470

go with a man-of-war; MOORE-181X-2,14.471

thou bee'st scollard enough for that. 'MOORE-181X-2,14.472

Fare to Reading +L1 12 <font> s. <$$font>; MOORE-181X-2,14.473

fare to town, 14 <font> s <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,14.476

Macdonald told me some interesting naval stories; particularly of
Corbet's towing the French frigate off, after she had cut her cable to
run on shore.  MOORE-181X-2,14.477

Dined by myself at the George, opposite the Hay-market;
MOORE-181X-2,14.478

and had oysters at night at the York, in St. James's Street.
MOORE-181X-2,14.479

<font> 25th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,14.480

Received a letter from Lord Holland asking me to Holland House, and
bidding me'bring my nightcap'.  MOORE-181X-2,14.481

<font> 27th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,14.482

Slept at Holland House.  MOORE-181X-2,14.483

Walked before breakfast with Tierney, Rogers, &c, in the garden,
MOORE-181X-2,14.484

and read Luttrell's very pretty verses, written under Lord Holland's,
in the seat called'Rogers'seat'.  MOORE-181X-2,14.485

The breakfast very agreeable: MOORE-181X-2,14.486

Lord Holland full of sunshine as usual.  MOORE-181X-2,14.487

'He always comes down to breakfast <paren> says Rogers very truly
<$$paren> like a man upon whom some sudden good fortune had just fallen.
'MOORE-181X-2,14.488

<font> 26th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,14.489

Another very agreeable breakfast, though a very late one - not till
nearly twelve o'clock.  MOORE-181X-2,14.490

Rogers wished me to go and dine this day with his brother and sister
at Highbury.  MOORE-181X-2,14.491

I assented, if he would take upon himself to stand the brunt of Lady
Holland's displeasure on the occasion.  MOORE-181X-2,14.492

In for a very amusing scene between them on the subject, she insisting
upon keeping me, and he most miraculously courageous and persevering in
taking me away.  MOORE-181X-2,14.493

'Why', says she to me,'do you allow him to dispose of you thus, like a
little bit of literary property? 'MOORE-181X-2,14.494

<font> 28th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,14.495

Called upon Lord Lansdowne, who is returning to Wiltshire the day after
tomorrow, and offers to take me.  MOORE-181X-2,14.496

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} go.  MOORE-181X-2,14.497

Dined to-day with Scrope Davies to meet Jackson the boxer at my own
request, as I want to pick up as much of the flash, <font> from authority,
<$$font> as possible.  MOORE-181X-2,14.498

Some talk with Davies before dinner, about Lord Byron and me having been
so near blowing each other's brains out: MOORE-181X-2,14.499

told him that Lord B. had said since he never <P_15> meant to
fire at me.  MOORE-181X-2,15.500

Davies was with him at the time this hostile correspondence took place,
MOORE-181X-2,15.501

and offered to bet upon friendship against fighting as the most likely
result.  MOORE-181X-2,15.502

The event found him right.  MOORE-181X-2,15.503

Lord B.'s conduct on this occasion was full of manliness and candour.
MOORE-181X-2,15.504

Got very little out of Jackson; MOORE-181X-2,15.505

he makes, Davies tells me, more than a thousand a-year by teaching
sparring.  MOORE-181X-2,15.506

<font> December 1st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,15.507

Called upon Gifford, editor of the'Quarterly'; MOORE-181X-2,15.508

have known him long, MOORE-181X-2,15.509

but forbore from calling upon him ever since I meditated'Lalla Rookh
', lest it might look like trying to propitiate his criticism;
MOORE-181X-2,15.510

the mildest man in the world till he takes a pen in his hand,
MOORE-181X-2,15.511

but then all gall and spitefulness.  MOORE-181X-2,15.512

Spoke of Holland House.  MOORE-181X-2,15.513

He knew it, he said, by report; MOORE-181X-2,15.514

wished there was a Holland House on the other side of the question,
MOORE-181X-2,15.515

but there was not; MOORE-181X-2,15.516

said it was in politics and literature what Sir J. Banks's house
was in science; and neither could be replaced.  MOORE-181X-2,15.517

Party at dinner, Lord Alvanley, Berkeley Craven, Lady Affleck, Sharpe
and Rogers.  MOORE-181X-2,15.518

Sat next Lord Alvanley, MOORE-181X-2,15.519

and had much conversation with him about Lords Forbes and Rancliffe,
and others of my early cronies.  MOORE-181X-2,15.520

The conversation to-day of rather a commoner turn than usual, on account
of these slang bucks, but still very agreeable.  MOORE-181X-2,15.521

Alvanley just hits that difficult line between the gentleman and the
jolly fellow, MOORE-181X-2,15.522

and mixes their shades together very pleasantly; MOORE-181X-2,15.523

but Craven goes further.  MOORE-181X-2,15.524

Though clever in his way, he is too decidedly <font> flash <$$font>
in his tones, words, manner, everything.  MOORE-181X-2,15.525

When one meets him in such company,'one wonders how the devil he got
there. 'MOORE-181X-2,15.526

<font> 2nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,15.527

Conversation at breakfast about late hours.  MOORE-181X-2,15.528

The porter of the late Lord Jersey came to some one MOORE-181X-2,15.529

and complained he could not stay with the Jerseys, because my lady was
the very latest woman in London, MOORE-181X-2,15.530

'Well, but what then?  MOORE-181X-2,15.531

All women of fashion are late, MOORE-181X-2,15.532

you can sleep afterwards. 'MOORE-181X-2,15.533

'Ah no, sir, $that $'s {TEXT:that's} not all, MOORE-181X-2,15.534

for my lord is the earliest gentleman in London; MOORE-181X-2,15.535

and, between the two, I get no sleep at all. 'MOORE-181X-2,15.536

<font> 3rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,15.537

Found a note from Scrope Davies, on my return home very late, to say that
we must be in our chaise for the fight <paren> which I had engaged to go -
to see with him <$$paren> at eight in the morning.  MOORE-181X-2,15.538

<font> 4th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,15.539

Breakfasted with Davies at seven.  MOORE-181X-2,15.540

Walked to Jackson's house in Grosvenor Street; a very neat establishment
for a boxer.  MOORE-181X-2,15.541

Were off in our chaise at eight.  MOORE-181X-2,15.542

The immense crowds of carriages, pedestrians, &c. all along
the road - the respect paid to Jackson everywhere, highly comical.
MOORE-181X-2,15.543

He sung some flash songs on the way, MOORE-181X-2,15.544

and I contrived to muster up one or two myself, much to Scrope Davies's
surprise and diversion.  MOORE-181X-2,15.545

The scene of action beyond Crawley, thirty-two miles from town;
MOORE-181X-2,15.546

the combatants Randall and Turner, the former an Irishman, which was
lucky, as it gave me some sort <P_16> of interest in the contest.
MOORE-181X-2,16.547

The thing altogether not so horrid as I expected.  MOORE-181X-2,16.548

Turner's face was a good deal dehumanised, MOORE-181X-2,16.549

but Randall <paren> the conqueror <$$paren> had hardly a scratch.
MOORE-181X-2,16.550

The battle lasted two hours and twenty-two minutes: MOORE-181X-2,16.551

a beautiful sunshine broke out at this part of the day;
MOORE-181X-2,16.552

and had there been a proportionate mixture of women in the immense
ring formed around, it would have been a very brilliant spectacle.
MOORE-181X-2,16.553

The pigeons let off at different periods of the fight, with dispatches,
very picturesque; MOORE-181X-2,16.554

at the close, as many as half a dozen took wing.  MOORE-181X-2,16.555

It seems they are always sure messengers, unless they happen to meet
with a hawk.  MOORE-181X-2,16.556

Was to have dined with Douglas Kinnaird, to meet the Oxfords, and hear the
new prima donna, Madame Bellochi, sing in the evening; MOORE-181X-2,16.557

but did not get home till half-past eight at night.  MOORE-181X-2,16.558

<font> 5th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,16.559

Breakfast with Power, in order to walk to Hornsey and pay my usual visit
for Bessy at the grave of our dear Barbara.  MOORE-181X-2,16.560

Woolriche, whom I had seen but the day before, came and walked with us.
MOORE-181X-2,16.561

The Sunday papers all placarded with'true', and'genuine', and
'best'accounts of the battle.  MOORE-181X-2,16.562

On passing through Tottenham-court Road, we saw an immense congregation
of blackguards at the entrance of a passage called Cock Court.
MOORE-181X-2,16.563

Asked what was the matter?  MOORE-181X-2,16.564

'Randall lives here, sir. 'MOORE-181X-2,16.565

It was the conqueror's levee.  MOORE-181X-2,16.566

I ought to pay these visits to my dear child alone, MOORE-181X-2,16.567

for the melancholy which came over me when I <font> did <$$font> go
alone was, I think, useful to me; MOORE-181X-2,16.568

such melancholy purifies the heart.  MOORE-181X-2,16.569

Found the grave neat and undisturbed.  MOORE-181X-2,16.570

<font> 6th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,16.571

Breakfasted at Rogers's.  MOORE-181X-2,16.572

Told me of Crabbe's negotiation with Murray for his new volume of'
Tales', consisting of near 12,000 lines.  MOORE-181X-2,16.573

Murray offered him for this and the copyright of the past volumes +L 3000.
MOORE-181X-2,16.574

Crabbe was at breakfast with us, MOORE-181X-2,16.575

and seemed to think this was a good bargain; MOORE-181X-2,16.576

and so, I confess, did I; MOORE-181X-2,16.577

but Rogers thought this sum should be given for the new volume alone,
and that the Longmans ought to be tried.  MOORE-181X-2,16.578

<font> 9th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,16.579

Came down in the coach <paren> the York House <$$paren> with two or
three women.  MOORE-181X-2,16.580

Arrived at Calne a little after seven, and at home before nine.
MOORE-181X-2,16.581

Found all well, my sweet Bessy looking better than I have seen her for
a long time.  MOORE-181X-2,16.582

<font> 22nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,16.583

Bessy thinks of giving a little dance next week, MOORE-181X-2,16.584

and as the idea seems to amuse her, she shall do it: MOORE-181X-2,16.585

the dear girl so seldom leaves her home, that she deserves every
enlivenment of which that sphere is capable.  MOORE-181X-2,16.586

<font> 23rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,16.587

Received from one of my female correspondents <paren> the lady who
loved the Irish giant <$$paren> a Christmas present, consisting of a
goose, a pot of pickles, another of clouted cream, and some apples.
MOORE-181X-2,16.588

This, indeed, is a tribute of admiration more solid than I generally
receive from these fair {COM:illustrations_omitted} <P_17> admirers of
my poetry.  MOORE-181X-2,17.589

The young Bristol lady, who inclosed me three pounds after reading 'Lalla
Rookh', had also very laudable ideas on the subject; MOORE-181X-2,17.590

and if every reader of'Lalla Rookh'had done the same, I need never have
written again.  MOORE-181X-2,17.591

Read the'Heart of Mid-Lothian'to Bessy in the evening.
MOORE-181X-2,17.592

Have got a wet-nurse for little Tommy, a woman in the neighbourhood , to
come three times a day, which is better than nothing.  MOORE-181X-2,17.593

Poor little thing!  MOORE-181X-2,17.594

with a mother that can give him no milk, and a father that can give him
no money, what business has he in this world?  MOORE-181X-2,17.595

<font> 30th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,17.596

Routed out of my study by the preparations for the dance tomorrow night
, MOORE-181X-2,17.597

and not able to get into my <font> other <$$font> study, the garden,
on account of the damp, foggy weather.  MOORE-181X-2,17.598

Copied out some music.  MOORE-181X-2,17.599

At a quarter to six, Macdonald called upon me to go to dinner at Bowood
; MOORE-181X-2,17.600

obliged to feel our way, not very safely, through the fog.
MOORE-181X-2,17.601

<font> 31st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,17.602

All bustle and preparation for our dance in the evening;
MOORE-181X-2,17.603

the supper laid in my study.  MOORE-181X-2,17.604

Poor Bessy on her legs all day, to get everything as nice as possible;
MOORE-181X-2,17.605

my chief occupation, besides drawing the wine, to keep little Tom quiet.
MOORE-181X-2,17.606

All went off most gaily.  MOORE-181X-2,17.607

We did our best to make them happy; MOORE-181X-2,17.608

and, to do our guests justice, they seemed all to come with a
determination to be pleased.  MOORE-181X-2,17.609

Supped at half-past twelve.  MOORE-181X-2,17.610

I had lobsters, oysters, and champagne, express from London for the
occasion, MOORE-181X-2,17.611

and the supper looked not only gay but elegant.  MOORE-181X-2,17.612

Twenty-two persons supped in my little study.  MOORE-181X-2,17.613

I sung for them after supper, MOORE-181X-2,17.614

and then to dancing again till near four in the morning.
MOORE-181X-2,17.615

Poor Bessy's eyes, which have been sore for some days, dreadfully inflamed
and red through the whole evening.  MOORE-181X-2,17.616

A gay beginning to the new year.  MOORE-181X-2,17.617

<P_18>

{ED:1819}

<font> January 5th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,18.620

To the Devizes ball in the evening: MOORE-181X-2,18.621

Lady Frances W. there; MOORE-181X-2,18.622

introduced to her, MOORE-181X-2,18.623

and had much conversation, chiefly about our friend Lord B.
MOORE-181X-2,18.624

Several of those beautiful things, published <paren> if I remember right
<$$paren> with'The Bride', were addressed to her.  MOORE-181X-2,18.625

She must have been very pretty when she had more of the freshness of youth
, though she is still but five or six and twenty; MOORE-181X-2,18.626

but she looks faded already.  MOORE-181X-2,18.627

She told me she had an Album which had been begun and nearly half written
through by Lord B. MOORE-181X-2,18.628

<paren> the first thing in it,"When from the brow, where sorrow sits
'<$$paren>; MOORE-181X-2,18.629

and she had another, which was as yet blank, and which she had resolved
to keep blank'till an introduction to Mr. M. should enable
her to ask <font> him <$$font> to begin it for her'.  MOORE-181X-2,18.630

I fought this off as well as I could; MOORE-181X-2,18.631

said I must know her better before I could have the <font> te`te
monte`e <$$font> sufficiently for such an undertaking, &c.
MOORE-181X-2,18.632

<font> 27th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,18.633

Dined at half-past two, MOORE-181X-2,18.634

and at half-past three set off in a chaise for Calne: MOORE-181X-2,18.635

four coaches and the mail to pass through; MOORE-181X-2,18.636

had not doubt of a place, MOORE-181X-2,18.637

but every thing seems to conspire against the poor poet's purse;
MOORE-181X-2,18.638

all were full; MOORE-181X-2,18.639

what was to be done?  MOORE-181X-2,18.640

I must be in town next day, MOORE-181X-2,18.641

and I had but five pounds in my pocket, which would be far short of the
expense of posting; MOORE-181X-2,18.642

so I borrowed five pounds more of the man at the White Hart,
MOORE-181X-2,18.643

and started in my solitary chaise at about eight.  MOORE-181X-2,18.644

Arrived in town about half-past nine; MOORE-181X-2,18.645

drove to the New Hummuns, MOORE-181X-2,18.646

and had a warm bath.  MOORE-181X-2,18.647

No room for me at my old lodgings in Duke Street; MOORE-181X-2,18.648

was forced to put up at the George, in Coventry Street.
MOORE-181X-2,18.649

Dined in Paternoster Row.  MOORE-181X-2,18.650

Had met Phillips <paren> the member <$$paren> and Sydney Smith together
in Leicester Square.  MOORE-181X-2,18.651

Rees and I went after dinner to the Sanspareil, and from thence to the
pantomime at Covent Garden <paren> Harlequin Munchausen <$$paren> ,
with which I was much amused.  MOORE-181X-2,18.652

<font> 28th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,18.653

Went to breakfast with Rogers, who is in the very agonies of parturition
: MOORE-181X-2,18.654

showed me the work ready printed and in boards, MOORE-181X-2,18.655

but he is still making alterations: MOORE-181X-2,18.656

told me that Lord Byron's'Don Juan'is pronounced by Hobhouse and others
as unfit for publication.  MOORE-181X-2,18.657

Called upon Shec the painter, who told me that Lord Holland was so much
pleased with his picture of <P_19> me <paren> a copy from that which
Richard Power bought, and not at all so good <$$paren>, that he said he
must have it: MOORE-181X-2,19.658

'Must have my friend $Moore $'s {TEXT:Moore's} picture. '
MOORE-181X-2,19.659

'This shows <paren> said Shee <$$paren> how you stand in that house'
, MOORE-181X-2,19.660

and it is certainly flattering.  MOORE-181X-2,19.661

Went to Murray.  MOORE-181X-2,19.662

Rogers had told me that Murray said he would himself, whether Wilkie
came into it or not, run all risks in publishing my'Life of Sheridan ',
and give me a thousand pounds for it.  MOORE-181X-2,19.663

I now found this was the case.  MOORE-181X-2,19.664

Talked of'Don Juan': MOORE-181X-2,19.665

but too true that it is not fit for publication: MOORE-181X-2,19.666

he seems, by living so long out of London, to have forgotten that.
standard of decorum in society to which every one must refer his <font>
words <$$font> at least, who hopes to be either listened to or read by
the world.  MOORE-181X-2,19.667

It is all about himself and Lady B., and raking up the whole
transaction in a way the world would never bear.  MOORE-181X-2,19.668

<font> 29th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,19.669

Breakfasted with the Donegals; MOORE-181X-2,19.670

called afterwards upon Rogers, and from thence to Lord Holland's in
St. James's Square; MOORE-181X-2,19.671

found Lord and Lady H. and Allen at home, just down to breakfast,
though near two o'clock.  MOORE-181X-2,19.672

...  Went to Toller, MOORE-181X-2,19.673

and signed the affidavits; MOORE-181X-2,19.674

called at Longmans, MOORE-181X-2,19.675

and then home to dress for the Covent Garden dinner.  MOORE-181X-2,19.676

The Duke of Sussex came out of the circle upon seeing me,
MOORE-181X-2,19.677

and most cordially giving me both his hands, walked me into a corner to
converse with me.  MOORE-181X-2,19.678

This <font> ought <$$font> to be flattering from royal persons,
MOORE-181X-2,19.679

but, somehow, our precious Princes contrive that it should <font> not
<$$font> be so.  MOORE-181X-2,19.680

The D. of S. is, however, as far as society goes, a
perfectly good natured and unaffected person.  MOORE-181X-2,19.681

The dinner long and tiresome.  MOORE-181X-2,19.682

Lord Holland had asked me to go home with him after it,
MOORE-181X-2,19.683

but having been crammed up in a corner with dirty dishes, I did not feel
clean enough for decent society afterwards.  MOORE-181X-2,19.684

<font> 30th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,19.685

Met Hobhouse, MOORE-181X-2,19.686

and walked some time with him; MOORE-181X-2,19.687

has no doubt of succeeding, MOORE-181X-2,19.688

but fears that Hunt will worry him prodigiously: MOORE-181X-2,19.689

says he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} sleep at nights from anxiety,
MOORE-181X-2,19.690

and he certainly seems wasting away under his patriotic operations.
MOORE-181X-2,19.691

Asked him, had I any chance of a glimpse at Don Juan?  MOORE-181X-2,19.692

and then found that Byron had desired it might be referred to my
decision , the three persons whom he had bid Hobhouse consult as to the
propriety of publishing it being Hookham Frere, Stewart Rose, and myself.
MOORE-181X-2,19.693

Frere, as the only one of the three in town, had read it and pronounced
decidedly against the publication.  MOORE-181X-2,19.694

Went to Lady Donegal's: MOORE-181X-2,19.695

on the way met my excellent old friend Admiral Douglas.
MOORE-181X-2,19.696

Frere came in while I was at Lady D.'s: MOORE-181X-2,19.697

was proceeding to talk to him about our joint umpireship on Byron's poem,
when he stopped me by a look, MOORE-181X-2,19.698

and we retired into the next room to speak over the subject.
MOORE-181X-2,19.699

He said he did not wish the opinion he had <P_20> pronounced to be known
to any one except B. himself, lest B. should suppose
he was taking merit to himself among the <font> righteous <$$font>
for having been the means of preventing the publication of the poem.
MOORE-181X-2,20.700

Spoke of the disgust it would excite, if published; the attacks in it
upon Lady B. ; MOORE-181X-2,20.701

and said it is strange, too, he should think there was any connection
between patriotism and profligacy.  MOORE-181X-2,20.702

If we had a very Puritan court indeed, one can understand then profligacy
being adopted as a badge of opposition to it, MOORE-181X-2,20.703

but the reverse being the case, there is not even that excuse for
connecting dissoluteness with patriotism, which, on the contrary, ought
always to be attended by the sternest virtues.  MOORE-181X-2,20.704

<font> 31st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,20.705

Went to breakfast with Hobhouse, in order to read Lord Byron's poem:
a strange production, full of talent and singularity, as everything he
writes must be: MOORE-181X-2,20.706

some highly beautiful passages, and some highly humorous ones;
MOORE-181X-2,20.707

but, as a whole, not publishable.  MOORE-181X-2,20.708

Don Juan's mother is Lady Byron, and not only her learning, but various
other points about her, ridiculed.  MOORE-181X-2,20.709

He talks of her favourite dress being dimity <paren> which is
the case <$$paren>, dimity rhyming very comically with sublimity;
MOORE-181X-2,20.710

and the conclusion of one stanza is'I hate a dumpy woman', meaning Lady
B. again.  MOORE-181X-2,20.711

This would disgust the public beyond endurance.  MOORE-181X-2,20.712

There is also a systematised profligacy running through it, which would
not be borne.  MOORE-181X-2,20.713

Hobhouse has undertaken the delicate task of letting him know our joint
opinions.  MOORE-181X-2,20.714

<font> February 1st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,20.715

In the coach at half-past six: MOORE-181X-2,20.716

a young Irishman one of the passengers, whose family reside entirely
at Bath.  MOORE-181X-2,20.717

He abused the lower orders of Irish, MOORE-181X-2,20.718

and said it was impossible for a gentleman to <font> live <$$font>
among them without being <font> kilt.  <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,20.719

Take for granted, from what he said, that this father must be some
griping landlord or Orange magistrate.  MOORE-181X-2,20.720

Arrived at home at eight in the evening, MOORE-181X-2,20.721

and found the dear wife and her little ones well, and all smiles to
see me.  MOORE-181X-2,20.722

<font> 10th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,20.723

Received a note from Bowles, in which he said,'Have you seen the"
Quarterly"?  MOORE-181X-2,20.724

they are very complimentary to me as an author. 'MOORE-181X-2,20.725

How lucky it is that self-love has always something comfortable to
retire upon!  MOORE-181X-2,20.726

<font> 20th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,20.727

A sadness over me; sometimes like that of my young days, and therefore
pleasant, but sometimes mingled with self-reproach, and so far painful.
MOORE-181X-2,20.728

<font> 25th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,20.729

The Macdonalds and Hugheses dined with us.  MOORE-181X-2,20.730

With a little assistance from Phipps <paren> who joined us when his
wife and he came in the evening <$$paren> finished five bottles of wine.
MOORE-181X-2,20.731

All stayed to supper, MOORE-181X-2,20.732

and seemed to enjoy themselves.  MOORE-181X-2,20.733

I sang in the evening, MOORE-181X-2,20.734

and, in spite of the wine, was in good voice.  MOORE-181X-2,20.735

Macdonald brought two or three of the famous Chinese <P_21> birds'
nests to show us.  MOORE-181X-2,21.736

I eat of the soup one day at Sir S. Raffles's: MOORE-181X-2,21.737

the soup was like other soup, MOORE-181X-2,21.738

but the nest that floated in it was the devil.  MOORE-181X-2,21.739

<font> March 4th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,21.740

Received a letter from Miss -, one of my unknown lady correspondents,
who sent me the two specimens of her poetry, and said her own favourite
of the two was that which began'Come Stella, <font> arouse <$$font> thee'.
MOORE-181X-2,21.741

Wishes me to recommend her to the Longmans, MOORE-181X-2,21.742

and mentions the titles of about half-a-dozen works which they may
choose from.  MOORE-181X-2,21.743

Received also a letter from Mrs. -, the mother of the fourteen-year
old poetess, saying how melancholy her daughter was at my neglect of
her last communications, and sending me some pensive and rather pretty
verses the girl wrote on the occasion.  MOORE-181X-2,21.744

<font> 19th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,21.745

Bowles and I <paren> after securing our tickets for the Harmonic in the
evening <$$paren> dined at the White Hart.  MOORE-181X-2,21.746

Went at night to the Harmonic; MOORE-181X-2,21.747

very full rooms - at least 300 persons.  MOORE-181X-2,21.748

Introduced to a whole shoal of baronets, Sir Robert This and Sir John
That.  MOORE-181X-2,21.749

Never was so stared at in my life before.  MOORE-181X-2,21.750

Three things of mine sung,'The Minstrel Boy','Hark!  the Vesper Hymn',
and a glee from'Anacreon'.  MOORE-181X-2,21.751

At supper escaped from a wretched table, where I had been preordained to
sit between two ugly old <font> Blue Boars, <$$font> who said they wished
much to <font>'talk to <$$font> Mr. Moore'.  MOORE-181X-2,21.752

After supper, to my no small horror,'The Minstrel Boy'was sung again ,
for the purpose of introducing a speech about me from Captain Crofton,
proposing my health in a most panegyric style.  MOORE-181X-2,21.753

It was received with great acclamations; MOORE-181X-2,21.754

but, from having no previous suspicion of such an honour, I had hardly
a decent word to say in returning thanks for it.  MOORE-181X-2,21.755

I know I concluded thus: MOORE-181X-2,21.756

'But perhaps silence is the best sort of eloquence, particularly for an
Irishman: MOORE-181X-2,21.757

I shall, therefore', &c. &c. MOORE-181X-2,21.758

I meant to have said,'It is, at least, a very Irish sort.
'MOORE-181X-2,21.759

During the ball, was stared at on all sides without mercy.
MOORE-181X-2,21.760

In such a place as Bath, <font> any <$$font> little <font> lion <$$font>
makes a stir.  MOORE-181X-2,21.761

Got to bed between two and three.  MOORE-181X-2,21.762

<font> April 9th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,21.763

Good Friday: MOORE-181X-2,21.764

went to church.  MOORE-181X-2,21.765

A most inhuman sermon: MOORE-181X-2,21.766

the sufferings described with all the monotony and coolness of an
auctioneer.  MOORE-181X-2,21.767

How different do I remember the Passion sermons in Dublin chapels, when,
at the moment that the feelings of the congregation were excited to the
utmost pitch by the most eloquent and impassioned description of what
the Saviour had suffered, the orator suddenly produced the crucifix
before them, and the whole assembly, with groans and tears, prostrated
themselves on the earth.  MOORE-181X-2,21.768

<font> 19th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,21.769

Went to Chippenham with Phipps and Locke, to a dinner which the former
gave to his troop of yeomanry, all common farmers; MOORE-181X-2,21.770

the only gentlemen ourselves and Gosset.  MOORE-181X-2,21.771

A strange day: MOORE-181X-2,21.772

such tippling, and such <P_22> speechifying.  MOORE-181X-2,22.773

I proposed Lord Lansdowne's health, in a speech which but about three
persons out of the fifty understood a syllable of: MOORE-181X-2,22.774

but such men like to be talked to unintelligibly; MOORE-181X-2,22.775

they take it as a tribute to their understandings.  MOORE-181X-2,22.776

<font> 21st <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,22.777

Went to Bath; Bessy, myself, the little fellow, and the maid , in a
hack-chaise, and the Phippses in their own carriage.  MOORE-181X-2,22.778

Dined at the York House, MOORE-181X-2,22.779

and went in the evening to the theatre.  MOORE-181X-2,22.780

Young in'Cassius': MOORE-181X-2,22.781

got a wretched little private box, where we were almost suffocated,
MOORE-181X-2,22.782

but moved to Lady Burdett's for the farce.  MOORE-181X-2,22.783

Miss Tree sang my song of'Young Love lived once'very prettily,
MOORE-181X-2,22.784

and was encored with great enthusiasm.  MOORE-181X-2,22.785

Supped very merrily at the York House, MOORE-181X-2,22.786

and slept there.  MOORE-181X-2,22.787

<font> 22nd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,22.788

Walked about all day shopping: MOORE-181X-2,22.789

gave directions about the binding of my books at Upham's.
MOORE-181X-2,22.790

Met the Bishop of Meath, MOORE-181X-2,22.791

and walked with him up and down Milsom Street, talking of Sheridan.
MOORE-181X-2,22.792

Told me the story about the sermon: MOORE-181X-2,22.793

it was at a country-house of Sheridan's <paren> forget the name of the
place; must inquire <$$paren>: the company there at the time, Tickell,
Burgoyne, Mrs. Crewe.  MOORE-181X-2,22.794

The subject given to Sheridan at dinner on the Saturday by O'Beirne,
viz.'The abuse of riches'.  MOORE-181X-2,22.795

Sheridan absent at coffee and for the rest of the evening;
MOORE-181X-2,22.796

and O'Beirne found the MS. by his bedside next norning neatly
tied together with ribbon.  MOORE-181X-2,22.797

An admirable discourse, he said, though with several strange references
to Scripture; such as,'It is easier, as <font> Moses <$$font> says,
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle', &c. &c.
MOORE-181X-2,22.798

The person against whom the force of this sermon was directed was <font>
Child.  <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,22.799

Met Crabbe toddling about the streets: MOORE-181X-2,22.800

who would suspect that he is <font> the <$$font> Crabbe?
MOORE-181X-2,22.801

Lunched at a pastrycok's, MOORE-181X-2,22.802

and left Bath at five o'clock, Phipps driving, and I on the box with him;
the servants in the hack-chaise.  MOORE-181X-2,22.803

<font> 24th <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,22.804

A wet, gloomy day: MOORE-181X-2,22.805

my spirits of the same hue.  MOORE-181X-2,22.806

Often do I wish I had a <font> good cause to die in.  <$$font>
MOORE-181X-2,22.807

<font> 28th <$$font> MOORE-181X-2,22.808

$Bath - MOORE-181X-2,22.809

Breakfasted wth the Fitzgeralds.  MOORE-181X-2,22.810

Took me to call on Mrs. Piozzi; a wonderful old lady;
MOORE-181X-2,22.811

faces of other times seemed to crowd over her as she sat, - the Johnsons ,
Reynoldses, &c., &c.: MOORE-181X-2,22.812

though turned eighty, she has all the quickness and intelligence of a
gay young woman.  MOORE-181X-2,22.813

<font> May 3rd <$$font> - MOORE-181X-2,22.814

Set off from Calne in the York House coach for town.  MOORE-181X-2,22.815

Smattered a little theology with a clergyman, whom I at first took for
a clothier, but who turned out to be a very deep-read ecclesiastic;
a great advocate for Calvin.  MOORE-181X-2,22.816

Another of my companions turned out to be Sheddon, whose brother married
a sister of Monk Lewis.  MOORE-181X-2,22.817

Lewis died of the yellow fever, <P_23> he said; very unwilling to die; all
the last day exclaiming every instant,'The suspense!  the suspense! "which
the physician who attended him was doubtful whether he meant to allude
to religious doubts, or the success of a medicine which he had taken,
and on whose operation his life depended.  MOORE-181X-2,23.818

Arrived in town at half-past seven.  MOORE-181X-2,23.819
