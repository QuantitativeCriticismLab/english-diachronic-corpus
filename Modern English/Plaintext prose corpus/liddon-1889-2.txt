<$$heading>

No fact is more attested by wide experience, and few facts are more
pregnant with significance and warning, than the tendency of the human
mind to lose its hold of the sense and power of language, especially of
religious language, after constantly repeating it.  LIDDON-1889-2,1.7

Words, although sacred, and designed for universal use by the Highest of
all authorities, and richly endowed with spiritual power, do yet become
to us, through the process of constant usage, barren and unfruitful,
unless an effort be made from time to time to recover and reassert in
the human mind their original sense and import.  LIDDON-1889-2,1.8

So it is even with that most sacred Prayer which our Lord Himself
prescribed for the use of His disciples.  LIDDON-1889-2,1.9

Neither the associations of ages, nor <P_2> the varied experiences of
our own souls, which have gathered round the several petitions of the
Lord's Prayer, will avail to save us from saying it in a thoughtless
and formal way, unless we constantly remind ourselves of what it means;
of what it has meant to millions, of what it might mean to ourselves.
LIDDON-1889-2,2.10

And as this is true of words which our Lord Himself bids us use, so it is
no less true of other inspired words, which His Church has selected from
the Sacred Records, as being especially suited for constant employment
in public worship.  LIDDON-1889-2,2.11

It holds good of those psalms which, like the ninety-fifth or the
hundredth, or the seven psalms of Penitence, have been chosen for frequent
use on account of their spiritual intensity; and even of those three
hymns in which the earliest saints of the New Testament heralded the
Birth of the Divine Redeemer - the song of Zacharias, or the Benedictus
; the song of Simeon, or the Nunc Dimittis; and the song of Mary, or
the Magnificat.  LIDDON-1889-2,2.12

In view of this tendency to lose our hold on the sense of language
which on account of its excellence we repeat most frequently, it may
be well to devote the Sunday afternoons of the present month, to such
consideration as time will permit, of the familiar, but <P_3> not always
well-understood words of the first in order and the greatest of Christian,
hymns - the Magnificat.  LIDDON-1889-2,3.13

<heading>

I.  LIDDON-1889-2,3.15

<$$heading>

There is no mistaking the prominence assigned in the English Prayer-book,
as in many older Prayer-books of the Christian Church, to the Hymn
of Mary.  LIDDON-1889-2,3.17

It is the centre and heart of our Evening Service.  LIDDON-1889-2,3.18

All else leads up to it, LIDDON-1889-2,3.19

or expands it, LIDDON-1889-2,3.20

or radiates from it.  LIDDON-1889-2,3.21

We mount upwards to it by successive steps; by confession of the sins
which disqualify the soul of man for true communion with God; by the
great prayer which makes all communion with God easy and natural; by
psalms which express the longings of the human heart for some nearer
contact with God, or which sadly deplore whatever may hinder it, or
which joyfully anticipate its realization.  LIDDON-1889-2,3.22

We mount yet a step higher as we listen to some Lesson from the
Old Testament, which, whether it be history or prophecy, narrative
or moral teaching, poetry or prose, everywhere and always speaks
of Jesus Christ, to those who have ears to hear; suggesting Him
as the contrast to the human failures, or as the crown of the human
excellences which it describes; or announcing Him as <P_4> the Heavenly
Visitant Who, by-and-by, will still man's fears and warrant his hopes.
LIDDON-1889-2,4.23

Now, as of old, unless there be a vail {COM:sic} over the heart in the
reading of the Old Testament, the Great Teacher accompanies us through
its pages, LIDDON-1889-2,4.24

and, beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, expounds to us in all the
Scriptures the things concerning Himself.  LIDDON-1889-2,4.25

And thus we approach the Hymn which proclaims that all for which
Psalmists and Prophets have yearned has in very truth and deed come to be.
LIDDON-1889-2,4.26

Mary might seem evening by evening to stand in the church of her Divine
Son, while in strains which we shall consider, she celebrates an event
compared with which all else in human history is insignificant indeed.
LIDDON-1889-2,4.27

As from her thankful heart the incense of praise ascends to the Eternal
Throne, first in one and then another incense-wreath, each having its
own beauty of tint and form, we reflect that the hardest questions of
man's mind have been answered, and that the deepest yearnings of his
heart have been satisfied.  LIDDON-1889-2,4.28

The Only Begotten Son has come down from heaven to be born of a human
Mother, to die at the hands of His creatures, and to rise again.
LIDDON-1889-2,4.29

After this all else might seem, in some sense must seem, pale and poor ;
LIDDON-1889-2,4.30

but it is this great truth, set <P_5> forth or latent in every line of the
Magnificat which carries us on to the end of the Evening Service ; through
the Second Lesson, in which the Incarnate God speaks to us Himself or by
the lips of His Apostles; to the Nunc Dimittis, in which we take leave of
His message with thankful joy; to the Creed, in which we brace ourselves
for the toils and pains of life by a new profession of our faith in Him;
to the concluding prayers, in which His omnipotent Intercession is at
once the warrant of our praying at all, and of the confidence that we
shall be heard, not for our merits, but for His.  LIDDON-1889-2,5.31

It may seem strange that, from time to time, persons who have felt no
difficulty about the use of the old Hebrew psalms in Christian worship,
have been disposed to take offence at the public use of the Magnificat,
or, indeed, of all the Christian hymns which are preserved for us in
St. Luke's Gospel.  LIDDON-1889-2,5.32

Such a feeling, however, found expression shortly after the Book of
Common Prayer had come into use.  LIDDON-1889-2,5.33

It was maintained that unless we could all be in the exact circumstances
of Zacharias at the birth <P_6> of the Baptist, or of Simeon after seeing
our Lord in the Temple, or of Mary at the Visitation, we had no adequate
reason for singing their hymns.  LIDDON-1889-2,6.34

This amounts to saying that no hymn or psalm is to be Used by any other
person than its composer, unless the circumstances of the composer can
be exactly reproduced in the case of the man or the Church which sings
his hymn.  LIDDON-1889-2,6.35

Not to enquire how this rule would apply to modern and uninspired
compositions which are largely in use among us, we may observe that it
would forbid any use whatever of the Psalter itself in public or private
devotion - a use to which, however, oddly enough, those old objectors who
have been referred to, do not seem to have objected.  LIDDON-1889-2,6.36

For every psalm was composed in a special set of circumstances, some
of which can, while some $can $not {TEXT:cannot}, be ascertained;
LIDDON-1889-2,6.37

and yet it does not seem to have been argued that, because we $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} make these circumstances our own, we are precluded from
using the psalms.  LIDDON-1889-2,6.38

We are none of us in the position of David persecuted by a jealous
sovereign, or insulted and rebelled against <P_7> by a favourite son
, or bringing the ark to the sanctuary of Zion, or ordering a royal
household according to the Divine Law.  LIDDON-1889-2,7.39

The glories of Solomon, the conquest and humiliation of Rehoboam,
the repulse of Sennacherib, the ruin and desolation of Jerusalem by the
Babylonian conqueror, the sadness of the captives weeping by the waters of
Babylon, the laying the corner-stone of the new temple after the exile ,
- these, and many other like subjects or events, are the occasions of
psalms, which yet we use at this day to express the fears, or hopes,
or resolves, or aspirations of our own souls.  LIDDON-1889-2,7.40

Clearly, if such a difference of circumstances does not forbid the
recitation of Hebrew psalms, it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} preclude us from
using New Testament hymns; which, as Richard Hooker has said,"concern
us so much more than the songs of David, as the Gospel toucheth us more
than the Law, the New Testament than the Old. "LIDDON-1889-2,7.41

But in truth, whether it be Jewish psalm or Christian hymn, we Christians
use them because their inspiration lifts them above the limits of
the time, the place, the events which witnessed their composition.
LIDDON-1889-2,7.42

As a work of natural genius, <P_8> whether it be poem, or speech, or
painting, or statue, has that in it which detaches it from the study
of the poet, the audience of the speaker, the workroom of the artist,
and makes it belong to all times and countries; so much more do words
that are supernaturally inspired carry with them the certificate of an
universal applicability, which is independent of places, and events ,
and epochs, and authorship, and, indeed, of everything save His Mind
from Whom they proceed, and that heart and understanding of His creatures
which needs and welcomes them.  LIDDON-1889-2,8.43

The Magnificat, then, is the Hymn of the Incarnation.  LIDDON-1889-2,8.44

It was uttered in circumstances the like of which had never before , and
have never since, surrounded any human being whatever.  LIDDON-1889-2,8.45

Mary had been told at Nazareth by a heavenly messenger that she was to
be the Mother of Him in Whom all God's best promises to Israel and to
the human race were to be fulfilled.  LIDDON-1889-2,8.46

And she was to be His Mother, not in the ordinary way of nature, but,
as became His pre-existing glory, and as was needed in order to cut off
the entail of evil which came down from the first father of our race,
in a new and supernatural way.  LIDDON-1889-2,8.47

"The Holy Ghost"- so ran the prediction -"shall come upon thee,
LIDDON-1889-2,8.48

and <P_9> the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:
LIDDON-1889-2,9.49

therefore also that Holy Thing Which shall be born of thee shall be
called the Son of God. "LIDDON-1889-2,9.50

Mary knew that she was to be the Mother of the Divine Messiah, when she
traversed the land from Nazareth to a country house some few miles from
Jerusalem, on a visit to her cousin Elisabeth, the future mother of the
Baptist, LIDDON-1889-2,9.51

It was their meeting which was the immediate occasion of the Magnificat
, LIDDON-1889-2,9.52

Elisabeth had no sooner heard from the lips of Mary the wonted salutation
, of"Peace be to thee! "with which religious Jews greeted each other
after a long absence, than, under the influence of the holy spirit of
prophecy which filled her soul, she broke out into words which mark
the high significance of Mary's destiny scarcely less clearly than does
Mary's own Magnificat.  LIDDON-1889-2,9.53

"She spake with a loud voice, LIDDON-1889-2,9.54

and said, Blessed art thou among women, LIDDON-1889-2,9.55

and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.  LIDDON-1889-2,9.56

And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?
"LIDDON-1889-2,9.57

The Mother of my Lord!  LIDDON-1889-2,9.58

Elisabeth was the elder woman, LIDDON-1889-2,9.59

and, as the wife of Zacharias, she was in a higher social position than
Mary; LIDDON-1889-2,9.60

but few things in religious history are more beautiful than her ready
and unstinted recognition <P_10> of the loftier vocation of her younger
relative.  LIDDON-1889-2,10.61

Her next sentence was at once a blessing and a prophecy;
LIDDON-1889-2,10.62

but they touched a secret spring in the illuminated soul of Mary,
LIDDON-1889-2,10.63

and she forthwith uttered her hymn of praise.  LIDDON-1889-2,10.64

She uttered it, as might seem, in a single jet; LIDDON-1889-2,10.65

but as it passed from her lips, as is usual with eastern poetry, it
fell, not of set design, but by an instinct of intrinsic fitness, into
divisions of unequal length, which we moderns should call strophes.
LIDDON-1889-2,10.66

Mary begins by offering up to God, with the whole strength and resource
of her spiritual being, that praise which she knows to be His due at
all times, and especially in view of the signal privilege and honour
that has been vouchsafed to her - LIDDON-1889-2,10.67

"My soul doth magnify the Lord.  LIDDON-1889-2,10.68

And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  LIDDON-1889-2,10.69

For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden. "
LIDDON-1889-2,10.70

Then, in a second strophe, she dwells for a moment on the singular and
gracious distinction whereby she has been chosen to be the Mother of
the Incarnate Son - LIDDON-1889-2,10.71

"For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
LIDDON-1889-2,10.72

For He That is mighty hath done to me great things; LIDDON-1889-2,10.73

And holy is His Name.  LIDDON-1889-2,10.74

And His mercy is on them that fear Him throughout all generations.
"LIDDON-1889-2,10.75

<P_11>

But during these moments of thankful exultation her vision has widened
to embrace new horizons, LIDDON-1889-2,11.77

and, in a third strophe, she sets forth some relations of the Birth
of her Son to the action of God's Providence in the history of human
nations and human lives - LIDDON-1889-2,11.78

"He hath showed strength with His Arm; LIDDON-1889-2,11.79

He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
LIDDON-1889-2,11.80

He hath put down princes from their thrones, LIDDON-1889-2,11.81

And hath exalted men of low degree.  LIDDON-1889-2,11.82

He hath filled the hungry with good things; LIDDON-1889-2,11.83

And the rich He hath sent empty away. "LIDDON-1889-2,11.84

Once more, in a concluding strophe, she traces the great gift which,
through her, has been bestowed on the race of man, up to its sources in
the Compassion and the Faithfulness of God.  LIDDON-1889-2,11.85

"He remembering His Mercy Hath holpen His servant Israel; As He promised
to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, for ever.  "LIDDON-1889-2,11.86

It has more than once been suggested that such a Hymn as this is not
the kind of response which it would be natural for us to make in reply
to such a congratulation as Elisabeth's; LIDDON-1889-2,11.87

and it is hinted <P_12> that the composition may be really due to some
later writer, whether the Evangelist or another.  LIDDON-1889-2,12.88

Upon this we may remark that"natural"is a term of varying import; and
that what is natural to one person, or people, or age, is far from being
natural to another.  LIDDON-1889-2,12.89

We have only to look around us in order to discover that persons
of different temperaments meet similar occasions very differently.
LIDDON-1889-2,12.90

One man is reserved and sparing of his words, LIDDON-1889-2,12.91

another is effusive; LIDDON-1889-2,12.92

this man checks his feelings, LIDDON-1889-2,12.93

that man indulges them; LIDDON-1889-2,12.94

one is as literal and prosaic as may be, LIDDON-1889-2,12.95

another almost inevitably expresses himself in the language of poetry.
LIDDON-1889-2,12.96

Then the Eastern and Western nations differ now in these respects as
they have always differed.  LIDDON-1889-2,12.97

To many an Arab at this hour it is perfectly natural to discuss an
everyday occurrence in words which have the form and rhythm of a poetical
composition.  LIDDON-1889-2,12.98

That which an European would put into a sentence, the Arab will expand
into what is virtually a poem, with rhythmic rise and fall, and refrains
and repetitions, and appeals to all kinds of higher considerations, not
perhaps foreign to the subject, but not necessary to its due discussion.
LIDDON-1889-2,12.99

No Englishman who had just lost his king and his friend would forthwith
break out into an <P_13> effusion such as that in which David laments
the death of Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa; LIDDON-1889-2,13.100

but in David, as in many another Eastern, ancient or modern - apart from
any question of inspiration - it was almost a matter of course to do so.
LIDDON-1889-2,13.101

And Mary, instinct with the spirit of prophecy, answers Elisabeth's
congratulations in a burst of inspired poetry, based on older words
which she has known from infancy, and which she so transfigures as to
make them express the fact which fills her grateful soul with wonder
and joy.  LIDDON-1889-2,13.102

To measure her utterance by the prosaic rules of our Western
temperament , is to forget the most obvious laws of equitable criticism.
LIDDON-1889-2,13.103

Nor, we may confidently add, is there any real ground for the
assertion that Mary's Magnificat was the work of any other than Mary.
LIDDON-1889-2,13.104

Like the songs of Zacharias and Simeon, it is something more than a psalm,
and something less than a complete Christian hymn.  LIDDON-1889-2,13.105

A Christian poet, living after the Resurrection of Christ, would surely
have said more; LIDDON-1889-2,13.106

a Hebrew psalmist would have said less than Mary.  LIDDON-1889-2,13.107

In this Hymn of hers we observe a consciousness of nearness to the
fulfilment of the great promises, to which there is <P_14> no parallel
even in the latest of the psalms; LIDDON-1889-2,14.108

and yet even Mary does not speak of the Promised One as an Evangelist or
an Apostle would have spoken of Him, by His Human Name, and with distinct
reference to the mysteries of His Life and Death and Resurrection.
LIDDON-1889-2,14.109

Her Hymn was a native product of one particular moment of transition
in sacred religious history, and of no other; when the twilight of the
ancient dispensation was melting, but had not yet melted, into the full
daylight of the new.  LIDDON-1889-2,14.110

Certainly the Magnificat is an inspired Psalm; LIDDON-1889-2,14.111

it belongs to the highest degree of inspiration, LIDDON-1889-2,14.112

and yet it does not claim an absolute originality.  LIDDON-1889-2,14.113

It is, in truth, modelled very largely, although not altogether, on
an older Psalm, which Hannah had sung many a century before at the
door of the tabernacle in Shiloh, when she brought to it her infant
son Samuel, as she said, to"lend him to the Lord as long as he liveth.
"LIDDON-1889-2,14.114

Hannah's history had an especial place in the heart and thoughts
of every Jewish woman.  Not only because she was the mother of the
great and austere prophet, who may claim in some respects <P_15>
an unrivalled importance in the history of the people of Revelation,
but also and because her deferred hopes, her bitter disappointments,
the rough misunderstanding to which she was exposed even at the hands of
the gentle and weak old man who then held the office of high priest in
Israel, have a human pathos that is all their own.  LIDDON-1889-2,15.115

At last her longings were fulfilled, LIDDON-1889-2,15.116

and when, in accordance with the terms of her vow, she consecrated her
son as a Nazarite to the lifelong service of God, her thankful heart
found vent in a Hymn of Praise, in repeating which many a Jewish mother
and maiden from that time forth associated herself with the sorrows and
the joys of Hannah.  LIDDON-1889-2,15.117

Listen to Hannah first and then to Mary, and you will perceive how
closely their hymns are related to each other.  LIDDON-1889-2,15.118

Each of these inspired women finds her joy in God; LIDDON-1889-2,15.119

each traces God's Hand in the exaltation of the humble and in the
humiliation of the proud; LIDDON-1889-2,15.120

each closes her song by dwelling on God's fulfilment of His promises.
LIDDON-1889-2,15.121

Mary, we see plainly, has reproduced the very ideas, the order of ideas,
nay, sometimes the very phrases, of the older hymn; LIDDON-1889-2,15.122

but she has made them subservient to a truth which was seen, if at all,
very <P_16> dimly, across the ages, by the older songstress, and which
is close and clear to herself.  LIDDON-1889-2,16.123

When Strauss observes that if the Virgin's Hymn had been inspired from on
high we might expect in it more of originality, it is not out of place to
reflect that God the Holy Ghost is not bound to adopt the exact standard
of originality which may approve itself to a modern literary man of a
sceptical turn of mind.  LIDDON-1889-2,16.124

Originality does not consist always and only in the production of new
material, new thoughts, new phrases; LIDDON-1889-2,16.125

the truest originality may display itself when old ideas and old
phrases are enlisted in the service of some newly proclaimed truth.
LIDDON-1889-2,16.126

When, in her inspired Magnificat, Mary draws so largely upon the ancient
Hymn of Hannah, she is only doing what inspired souls had done again
and again before her.  LIDDON-1889-2,16.127

We $can $not {TEXT:cannot} read the Bible carefully, without noting how
Psalmist borrows from Psalmist, Prophet from Prophet, nay, it even might
seem, one Evangelist from another; the first object with all the sacred
writers being not the creation or the vindication of a poor reputation
<P_17> for one species of originality, but the clear exhibition of truth
through the employment of those precise words and thoughts which are
best able to do it justice.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.128

<heading>

II.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.130

<$$heading>

The first strophe of Mary's Hymn is a burst of praise.
LIDDON-1889-2,17.132

And we may note here three matters for consideration.
LIDDON-1889-2,17.133

1. There is, to begin with, the fact that in the order of Mary's
thoughts the praise of God comes first.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.134

To give God His due is not, with Mary, an afterthought;
LIDDON-1889-2,17.135

it is not appended to something relating to her friends or to herself.
LIDDON-1889-2,17.136

In Mary's soul God takes precedence of all besides.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.137

And therefore, in her Hymn, the praise of God takes the lead of all
other topics.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.138

This, be it observed, is the case, although her Hymn is also an answer
to the congratulations of a near relative.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.139

She is replying to Elizabeth, LIDDON-1889-2,17.140

but she instinctively, inevitably, turns the eye of her soul upwards.
LIDDON-1889-2,17.141

She addresses her first words to God.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.142

Now let us consider what would, in all probability, have been our own
course of procedure.  LIDDON-1889-2,17.143

You have achieved, let us suppose, some considerable <P_18> success,
LIDDON-1889-2,18.144

or you have escaped some disaster, LIDDON-1889-2,18.145

or some position or distinction has been conferred on you.
LIDDON-1889-2,18.146

Friends surround you with congratulations; some of them conventional
and perfunctory; many of them, let us be assured, sincere.
LIDDON-1889-2,18.147

Your friends paraphrase, after an earthly fashion, the words of Elisabeth
to Mary.  LIDDON-1889-2,18.148

They tell you that your success, your escape, your distinction, is a
gain and a joy to them.  LIDDON-1889-2,18.149

They associate themselves, by the expression of a warm and intimate
sympathy, with your satisfaction and delight; LIDDON-1889-2,18.150

they are honoured, LIDDON-1889-2,18.151

they are decorated, LIDDON-1889-2,18.152

they have succeeded and been distinguished, because you, their friend,
have won distinction and success.  LIDDON-1889-2,18.153

How do you reply?  LIDDON-1889-2,18.154

You begin by thanking them for their kindness.  LIDDON-1889-2,18.155

To succeed in a world where no friends are left to express their joy,
would be success robbed of two-thirds of its value.  LIDDON-1889-2,18.156

The old sometimes observe, pathetically, that success and honours have
come to them too late.  LIDDON-1889-2,18.157

And so you tell your friends with perfect sincerity that their
congratulations are more precious to you than anything that has been
done by or done to yourself, and that your first thought on this
auspicious occasion is the satisfaction which you have given them.
LIDDON-1889-2,18.158

The first verse of your <P_19> real Magnificat, if it were written out,
might perhaps run thus: LIDDON-1889-2,19.159

"My soul doth magnify the kindness and sympathy of my friends,
LIDDON-1889-2,19.160

and my spirit hath rejoiced in the pleasure which they have enjoyed on
my account. "LIDDON-1889-2,19.161

Or, it may be, you give your first thoughts to yourself.
LIDDON-1889-2,19.162

You do not wish to say too much about yourself, LIDDON-1889-2,19.163

but at the same time you will not affect a false modesty.
LIDDON-1889-2,19.164

You $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deny - that is the form which a sense of
personal merit takes when tempered with some misgivings as to the wisdom
of expressing it - you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deny that it is a great
satisfaction to you that efforts, long persevered in without success,
have at last succeeded; that merits, which it might have seemed were
entirely overlooked, have at last been recognized.  LIDDON-1889-2,19.165

You do not wish to dwell too much on the subject; LIDDON-1889-2,19.166

but, on the other hand, your conviction of what is the fact, and what you
call a"proper pride,"compels you to say thus much.  LIDDON-1889-2,19.167

With this view you would make the first verse of your Magnificat something
of this sort; LIDDON-1889-2,19.168

"My soul doth magnify myself, LIDDON-1889-2,19.169

and my spirit hath rejoiced in the efforts or merits which have at length
been rewarded as they deserve. "LIDDON-1889-2,19.170

But you are a Christian, or at least a Theist.  LIDDON-1889-2,19.171

You remember that, after all, there is such a Being <P_20> as God.
LIDDON-1889-2,20.172

If the truth is to be told, you do not feel Him to be very near to you ,
LIDDON-1889-2,20.173

but you do not wish to forget Him altogether.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.174

If He exists, - and you believe that He does exist, - He must have
something to do with everything that goes on.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.175

It is only right that you should recognize this.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.176

You recognize it somewhat tardily, and as a matter to be touched on
lightly; because, in fact, God is less real to you than you are to
yourself, or than your friends are.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.177

You would not ignore God; LIDDON-1889-2,20.178

still less would you deny His existence.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.179

But you think of Him, in many of your moods of mind, as an idea or
conception rather than as a living Being; a conception from which man's
mind can really subtract something, or to which it can add something,
as the ages pass.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.180

You do not think of Him as of One Who is entirely independent of you ,
but Who is also as near to you as are the influences which you can measure
and the creatures which you can touch, about which you talk to other men,
or of which you read in the newspapers.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.181

He is there; but on a somewhat distant and dim horizon of your thought.
LIDDON-1889-2,20.182

He is there, LIDDON-1889-2,20.183

and something must be said about Him; LIDDON-1889-2,20.184

but that something must befit your very thin and precarious idea of what
He is.  LIDDON-1889-2,20.185

And so at last, you say your <P_21> Magnificat after a third fashion:
LIDDON-1889-2,21.186

"A sense of intellectual fitness leads me to magnify the Lord;
LIDDON-1889-2,21.187

and I experience a satisfaction in admitting that now, as at other times,
something may be due to a higher Power than myself. " LIDDON-1889-2,21.188

How pathetically is all this in contrast with Mary!  LIDDON-1889-2,21.189

No doubt, to Mary, the joy of Elizabeth was a real joy;
LIDDON-1889-2,21.190

and she $can $not {TEXT:cannot} but have known that by lineage and
training she herself had been prepared for her own high destiny.
LIDDON-1889-2,21.191

But her first thought is of Him from Whose goodness all else proceeds ;
both the warm hearts, and kindness of friends, and the gifts, whether of
nature or of grace, which she had herself received.  LIDDON-1889-2,21.192

God must claim her first acknowledgments.  LIDDON-1889-2,21.193

Before Him she is as nothing; LIDDON-1889-2,21.194

and yet He, in His condescending Mercy, had deigned to visit her, as
none of His creatures had been visited before.  LIDDON-1889-2,21.195

She can only think of the contrast between her nothingness and His
Magnificence.  LIDDON-1889-2,21.196

If she glances for a moment at herself, it is to wonder that she should
have been noticed at all by her Creator.  LIDDON-1889-2,21.197

"He hath regarded"- not the humility, not the lowly temper;
LIDDON-1889-2,21.198

these graces were undoubtedly hers in a very eminent degree,
LIDDON-1889-2,21.199

but she is not thinking of them; LIDDON-1889-2,21.200

the original word will not lend itself to such a sense.
LIDDON-1889-2,21.201

-"He hath regarded <P_22> the low condition of His handmaiden.
"LIDDON-1889-2,22.202

Because the contrast between Him and herself is thus present to her;
because she is convinced that she has exerted no claim on Him, and that
whatever she has received has come from Him; she must begin with praise
- LIDDON-1889-2,22.203

"My soul doth magnify the Lord, LIDDON-1889-2,22.204

And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. "LIDDON-1889-2,22.205

2. Then Mary praises God with all the faculties and resources of
her spiritual being.  LIDDON-1889-2,22.206

"My soul doth magnify,"LIDDON-1889-2,22.207

"my spirit hath rejoiced. "LIDDON-1889-2,22.208

"Soul"and"spirit"are not two different names for the same thing.
LIDDON-1889-2,22.209

When St. Paul prays that the"whole spirit and soul and body of
the Thessalonian Christians may be preserved blameless unto the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ,"he does not use two words where one would
have sufficed.  LIDDON-1889-2,22.210

No doubt, alike in Biblical and popular language, both soul and spirit
are sometimes used alone for the whole immaterial part of man; as when
our Lord asks,"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain <P_23>
the whole world, and lose his own soul? "or when the Preacher says"
that the spirit shall return to God Who gave it. "LIDDON-1889-2,23.211

But when, as here, the words occur together, in more or less obvious
contrast with each other, they stand for the lower and higher parts of
that invisible half of man which accompanies his body, yet is distinct
from it.  LIDDON-1889-2,23.212

Soul is nearer to the bodily nature; spirit nearer to the nature of God.
LIDDON-1889-2,23.213

Soul in man is analogous to the higher life of the animals;
LIDDON-1889-2,23.214

the animals have in them nothing that corresponds to spirit.
LIDDON-1889-2,23.215

Soul receives impressions both from the external world and from spirit:
LIDDON-1889-2,23.216

and so, as here, it utters through the bodily organs that thought or
emotion which has previously been present to spirit.  LIDDON-1889-2,23.217

Soul is the seat of passion, of imagination, of impulse;
LIDDON-1889-2,23.218

spirit, while, as we see in this Hymn, it is, like pure thought, capable
of sublime joys all its own, is specially the seat of the self-measuring
and reflective reason, of memory, of deliberate and imperative will.
LIDDON-1889-2,23.219

Soul, it is plain, lives not far from the frontier of the things of time
and sense; LIDDON-1889-2,23.220

spirit <P_24> belongs to a sphere on which the things of time and sense
need not, and often do not, intrude.  LIDDON-1889-2,24.221

Between them soul and spirit include the whole incorporeal nature of man,
with all its powers; LIDDON-1889-2,24.222

and Mary summons them all, the highest and the lowest, the faculties
which traverse the world of sense, and the faculties which live among
the highest and most abstract truths, to the solemn work of praise.
LIDDON-1889-2,24.223

Her"soul"must magnify the Lord, because, as she sings, her" spirit"has
rejoiced in God her Saviour.  LIDDON-1889-2,24.224

Is there not here also a lesson to be learnt from Mary?
LIDDON-1889-2,24.225

Some men appear to think that a single power of the soul may be told off,
like a domestic servant or a soldier, when sent on a particular errand,
to discharge the duty of praise.  LIDDON-1889-2,24.226

One man bids his fancy engage in the work; and another his affections
; and another his reasoned sense of the fitness of things; and
another his instinct of beauty, turned towards the higher horizons.
LIDDON-1889-2,24.227

Nay!  LIDDON-1889-2,24.228

it might sometimes seem as though no mental or spiritual faculty was
bidden to engage in praise at all; LIDDON-1889-2,24.229

and Christians who make a serious effort to pray, and would be shocked
at the neglect to do so, leave the duty of praising the great Creator to
their neighbours, to the choir, to the choristers, or, it might almost
<P_25> seem, to the organ.  LIDDON-1889-2,25.230

And yet what a demand on all the faculties of our being is made by
one simple and oft-repeated act of praise, such as, for instance, the
Gloria Patri!  LIDDON-1889-2,25.231

We say it before we begin the Psalms; LIDDON-1889-2,25.232

we repeat it at the end of each Psalm and each Canticle, excepting the
Te Deum.  LIDDON-1889-2,25.233

It consists only of two verses, LIDDON-1889-2,25.234

and yet what infinite spheres does it bid us traverse!
LIDDON-1889-2,25.235

Our souls rise first to the Three Almighty Incomprehensible Subsistences
within the Being of the Godhead - LIDDON-1889-2,25.236

"Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
LIDDON-1889-2,25.237

"And then, remembering that the Eternal Three have ever been and ever
will be what They are, our thought reaches backwards into an unbegun,
and forwards into an unending eternity, while seeking for an instant to
touch the present, which, as we touch it, has already mingled with the
past - LIDDON-1889-2,25.238

"As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. "LIDDON-1889-2,25.239

If any of us should have cause to think that we have paid but scant
attention and embarked little or no spiritual effort in this oft-repeated
act of praise, let us bethink ourselves of the import of Mary's words.
LIDDON-1889-2,25.240

She would summon the whole mental and moral nature to the work of praise;
a work in which, as in a vast orchestra, each mental faculty has its
place, and <P_26> may bring its due and needed contribution to swell
the harmony of the mighty whole.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.241

No variety of emotion is so poor and lowly that it $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
utter something in honour of the Creator; LIDDON-1889-2,26.242

no power or resource of thought is so great that it is humbled by joining
in the tribute which is due from all finite minds to the Infinite.
LIDDON-1889-2,26.243

The old exhortation to the Temple choir may be paraphrased as addressed
to the faculties of the Christian soul - LIDDON-1889-2,26.244

"Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet, LIDDON-1889-2,26.245

Praise Him upon the lute and harp.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.246

Praise Him in the cymbals and dances: LIDDON-1889-2,26.247

Praise Him upon the strings and pipe.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.248

Praise Him upon the well-tuned cymbals: LIDDON-1889-2,26.249

Praise Him upon the loud cymbals.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.250

Let everything that hath breath Praise the Lord. "LIDDON-1889-2,26.251

3. Lastly, observe the title under which Mary praises God.
"My Saviour. "LIDDON-1889-2,26.252

"My spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. "LIDDON-1889-2,26.253

This designation, as you would know, although associated by Christian
faith, in an especial manner, with our Lord Jesus Christ, is much older
than the New Testament.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.254

It grew naturally out of Israel's faith in God's especial and protecting
Providence.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.255

"It is Thou that savest us from our enemies,"was the voice of the chosen
people from age to age.  LIDDON-1889-2,26.256

<P_27>

But the enemies were generally political foes, LIDDON-1889-2,27.258

and the salvation was victory in the field or deliverance from bondage.
LIDDON-1889-2,27.259

This outward and temporal salvation was, indeed, also a religious
salvation.  LIDDON-1889-2,27.260

Israel was the people of God; LIDDON-1889-2,27.261

the defeat of Israel was the defeat of the cause of God;
LIDDON-1889-2,27.262

the victory or salvation of Israel was the victory or the triumph of
that cause.  LIDDON-1889-2,27.263

But it is probable that a new impulse was given to this more spiritual
meaning by what would have seemed to pious Jews the profane assumption of
the title of Saviour by the pagan kings, who, after the death of Alexander
the Great, founded dynasties in Syria and in Egypt.  LIDDON-1889-2,27.264

If henceforth the God of Israel was to be addressed as Saviour, it must
be in a lofty and spiritual sense; LIDDON-1889-2,27.265

and thus Mary praises God as the Saviour, not of her country from temporal
ruin, but of her own soul from eternal death.  LIDDON-1889-2,27.266

The expression $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be explained by the clause,
"He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden;"which, while it
assigns the motive for Mary's praise, does not explain the title she
gives to God.  LIDDON-1889-2,27.267

The honour put on her by the Incarnation might be described by many
other names.  LIDDON-1889-2,27.268

But high office is one thing, personal <P_28> salvation another;
LIDDON-1889-2,28.269

and if Mary calls God her Saviour, it is for reasons independent of the
rank and duties which He has assigned to her.  LIDDON-1889-2,28.270

Let us reflect on the meaning of this expression on Mary's lips.
LIDDON-1889-2,28.271

Unique as was her office, magnificent as was the endowment of grace
bestowed on her, singular as were her humility, her purity, her likeness
to the Most Holy, she has and she needs a Saviour.  LIDDON-1889-2,28.272

She does not stand outside that universal law, that"all have sinned,
and come short of the glory of God. "LIDDON-1889-2,28.273

Hers is not a soul which finds its way to the courts of heaven without
recourse to that One"Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must
be saved. "LIDDON-1889-2,28.274

There is, in fact, no intermediate position in the kingdom of grace
between the Saviour and the saved; no neutral post, in which nothing is
received and from which nothing is bestowed.  LIDDON-1889-2,28.275

There is one Saviour, LIDDON-1889-2,28.276

and all others are simply saved, be their place in the spheres of glory
what it may, and whatever the graces that may have been here bestowed
on them.  LIDDON-1889-2,28.277

Mary owed, and owes what she was on earth, what she is in heaven, no less
entirely to the merits and the Precious Blood of her Divine Son, than
does the humblest Christian among us at this hour; LIDDON-1889-2,28.278

and she <P_29> offers the best praises that her soul can offer to God,
not as manifested first or only in the awful attributes of Knowledge or
Power, but as her Saviour.  LIDDON-1889-2,29.279

And in this, too, most assuredly she is a model for us.
LIDDON-1889-2,29.280

It is well indeed that we should think deeply and often on other aspects
of the Divine Nature, each one of which is a fitting object of adoring
praise.  LIDDON-1889-2,29.281

It is meet and right that we should give thanks to God for the great
glory of His Power, His Intelligence, His Love.  LIDDON-1889-2,29.282

But the sense of natural gratitude which He has put in our hearts bids
us remember that"God commendeth His love to us, in that, while we were
yet sinners, Christ died for us. "LIDDON-1889-2,29.283

There is much else for which we may praise God; LIDDON-1889-2,29.284

we must bless Him"for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings
of this life,"LIDDON-1889-2,29.285

But if we know what indeed we are, and what has been done and may yet
be done for us, we shall do more than thank Him for these fruits of
His bounty.  LIDDON-1889-2,29.286

We shall bless Him, above all, for His"inestimable love in the Redemption
of the world through, our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and
for the hope of glory,"which, through that Redemption, He has bestowed
on us.  LIDDON-1889-2,29.287

St. Luke I.  48 - 50.  {COM:epigraph_omitted} LIDDON-1889-2,30.292

<$$heading>

Last Sunday we left Mary, at the end of the first strophe of her
Hymn, beginning to disclose the motive that had inspired the burst
of praise with which she had replied to the salutation of Elisabeth.
LIDDON-1889-2,30.294

All the powers of her spiritual nature, ranging from the heights of
pure thought to the depths of passionate emotion, were engaged, like
the variously accomplished members of a great choir, in chanting the
glory of the Eternal Being; especially in His character of the Saviour
of herself and of the whole race of mankind.  LIDDON-1889-2,30.295

But the fact which immediately prompts her song is that He, in Whose
sight every <P_31> creature is manifest, and Whose eyes are in every
place, beholding the evil and the good, has deigned to cast on her a
look of profound significance.  LIDDON-1889-2,31.296

"He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden. " LIDDON-1889-2,31.297

The blood of David flows in her veins.  LIDDON-1889-2,31.298

But for some generations the royal race has lived in seclusion, among
the poor; cherishing the secret of its high descent, but resigning itself
to the destiny which God, in His Justice and His Love, had for the time
assigned to it.  LIDDON-1889-2,31.299

The low social estate of Mary was, in her eyes, associated with a low
spiritual estate; a condition which could pretend to no excellence or
merit in the eyes of God.  LIDDON-1889-2,31.300

Nevertheless, He had"looked upon her,"after such a fashion , that she
must needs break out into thankfulness and praise.  LIDDON-1889-2,31.301

It may be that her memory was haunted by some words of a later Psalmist
, describing an event which, like the Annunciation, though in an
immeasurably lower sense, was the reversal of a great humiliation.
LIDDON-1889-2,31.302

"He taketh the simple out of the dust, LIDDON-1889-2,31.303

And lifteth the poor out of the mire; That He may set him with the
princes, Even with the princes of His people. "LIDDON-1889-2,31.304

She thinks of herself as of the handmaiden, or, <P_32> more exactly,
the bondwoman of God; a slave who was simply His property, who could
plead no personal rights in arrest of His Will.  LIDDON-1889-2,32.305

And yet what had He not done for her?  LIDDON-1889-2,32.306

Before she goes further she must, out of sheer gratitude, own His bounty;
LIDDON-1889-2,32.307

and this she does in the second strophe of her Hymn, in which one
remarkable result of the high honour conferred on her, the Source to
which it is due, and the sense in which a kindred distinction may be
shared by all the true servants of God, are successively touched on.
LIDDON-1889-2,32.308

"For behold, from henceforth All generations shall call me blessed.
LIDDON-1889-2,32.309

For He That is mighty Hath done to me great things; LIDDON-1889-2,32.310

And holy is His Name.  LIDDON-1889-2,32.311

And His mercy is on them that fear Him Throughout all generations.
"LIDDON-1889-2,32.312

1. Mary places her finger first of all on one very startling
consequence of the honour assigned to her as Mother of the Divine
Redeemer.  LIDDON-1889-2,32.313

She would <P_33> live for ever in the memory of mankind.
LIDDON-1889-2,33.314

Elisabeth had said,"Blessed art thou among women;" LIDDON-1889-2,33.315

and Mary, so far from deprecating this high estimate of her privilege,
goes considerably beyond it.  LIDDON-1889-2,33.316

"Behold,"she exclaims,"from henceforth all generations shall call me
blessed. "LIDDON-1889-2,33.317

Undoubtedly there are in the Hebrew Scriptures sentences which Mary,
when thus speaking, may have had in her mind.  LIDDON-1889-2,33.318

Thus, at the birth of Asher, his mother Leah exclaimed,"Happy am I,
LIDDON-1889-2,33.319

for the daughters will call me blessed;"LIDDON-1889-2,33.320

and the child's name Asher,"the happy,"expresses the feeling of his
mother.  LIDDON-1889-2,33.321

And in the Book of Proverbs the children of the virtuous woman arise
up LIDDON-1889-2,33.322

and call her blessed; LIDDON-1889-2,33.323

and Malachi predicts a day when all nations would recognize
the blessedness of Israel as having been the people of God.
LIDDON-1889-2,33.324

But there is nothing in these sayings which is really comparable to Mary's
unique prophecy about herself; in which she anticipates the judgment, not
of some, but of all the generations of living men.  LIDDON-1889-2,33.325

"All generations shall call me blessed. "LIDDON-1889-2,33.326

That which, at first sight, must strike us in this language is its
boldness.  LIDDON-1889-2,33.327

Mary is sure of that <P_34> which, in ordinary experience, seems to lie
beyond the range of probable conjecture.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.328

She is sure of the future.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.329

Average human common sense, looking out upon the future, declares that
nothing is probable except the unforeseen.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.330

But Mary, too, surveys the future, LIDDON-1889-2,34.331

and she has no hesitation in foretelling the terms in which distant ages
will speak of herself.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.332

"Behold,"she cries,"from henceforth all generations shall call me
blessed. "LIDDON-1889-2,34.333

She is sure, first of all, that she will be remembered.
LIDDON-1889-2,34.334

Let us reflect what this means.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.335

In every generation of men, only a small minority of the dead is
remembered at all.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.336

A name commonly lives in a family for two or three generations at most.
LIDDON-1889-2,34.337

If a man is known to a wider circle, it may cherish his memory for a
few years.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.338

But the circle dies, LIDDON-1889-2,34.339

and the man is forgotten.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.340

There are, of course, some few memories that survive: rulers of peoples,
leaders of political parties, discoverers in art or science, masters
in literature.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.341

But you can almost count them on your fingers; LIDDON-1889-2,34.342

and their names, too, when a century has gone by, are often enough
on their way to pass into general oblivion, even though they should
linger in the notebooks of students and on the shelves of libraries.
LIDDON-1889-2,34.343

As a rule, all quickly disappear.  LIDDON-1889-2,34.344

A <P_35> human life drops like a pebble into the ocean of Eternity;
LIDDON-1889-2,35.345

for a few moments there are ripples on the surface, growing fainter as
the circles widen, LIDDON-1889-2,35.346

and then, so far as this world is concerned, the life which has
passed from sight is as forgotten as though it had never been lived.
LIDDON-1889-2,35.347

"Men fade like leaves, LIDDON-1889-2,35.348

they drop away Beneath the forest shade: LIDDON-1889-2,35.349

Others again succeed; LIDDON-1889-2,35.350

but they Are in oblivion laid. 'LIDDON-1889-2,35.351

So spake the sire of Grecian song; LIDDON-1889-2,35.352

Through each succeeding age, The words are caught and borne along By poet,
saint, and sage. "LIDDON-1889-2,35.353

This, I say, is the rule; LIDDON-1889-2,35.354

but Mary is confident that she will be an exception to it.
LIDDON-1889-2,35.355

She is, to all seeming, but a poor Syrian peasant-girl.
LIDDON-1889-2,35.356

And yet she dares to predict that this ordinary law of forgetfulness of
the dead will be suspended in her favour.  LIDDON-1889-2,35.357

Remember that, as yet, nothing has happened outwardly to warrant her
confidence.  LIDDON-1889-2,35.358

No Apostle has yet been called to the service of her Son;
LIDDON-1889-2,35.359

no miracle has been worked by Him; LIDDON-1889-2,35.360

no one has yet heard of His Resurrection or of His Sermon on the Mount;
LIDDON-1889-2,35.361

nay, He is still invisible; LIDDON-1889-2,35.362

He has scarcely laid aside the glory which He had with the Father before
the <P_36> world was; LIDDON-1889-2,36.363

He has not yet entered by birth into the world of sense.
LIDDON-1889-2,36.364

Mary has only the angel's promise to fall back upon.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.365

Yet she sees in it a warrant that she will live in the memories of men
to the furthest limits of time.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.366

But Mary not only knows that she will be always remembered;
LIDDON-1889-2,36.367

she declares that she will be congratulated on her blessedness as long
as her memory shall endure among men.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.368

Let us reflect here, that when a memory does survive, it often survives
only to be associated with a very different judgment from that which
was once accorded to it.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.369

A time comes when all who knew a living man or woman have passed away;
when the dead can only be studied in documents, in such documents as
may be still procurable.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.370

And then a reputation is forthwith cast into the crucible of criticism,
which constantly, under the guise of historical impartiality, ministers
to the passions or to the prejudices of the age.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.371

Criticism, indeed, is sometimes just; LIDDON-1889-2,36.372

it destroys unworthy idols, LIDDON-1889-2,36.373

and it redresses the injustice of contemporaries.  LIDDON-1889-2,36.374

But it is a very uncertain guide to absolute truth; LIDDON-1889-2,36.375

and it often illustrates by its capricious activity the point on which
I am insisting; LIDDON-1889-2,36.376

it shows how transient may be an earthly reputation, LIDDON-1889-2,36.377

Scarcely any two writers <P_37> who have discussed him, during the
seventy years that have passed since his death, have agreed as to the
merits or demerits of the first Napoleon.  LIDDON-1889-2,37.378

And if, to come nearer to our present subject, we recall the names of
women who have figured on the scene of human history - Hatapsu, Semiramis
, Zenobia, the Countess Matilda, Catharine of Medici, Elizabeth of
England, Mary Stuart, Maria Theresa, Catharine II. - how various
have been the world's judgments about them!  LIDDON-1889-2,37.379

But of such a vacillation respecting herself Mary has no apprehension
whatever.  LIDDON-1889-2,37.380

Filled with the spirit of prophecy, she looks down the long procession of
the coming ages, with their incessant vicissitudes of races and opinions,
LIDDON-1889-2,37.381

and she knows that her name will ever carry with it associations which
must secure for it a universal welcome.  LIDDON-1889-2,37.382

"From henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. "
LIDDON-1889-2,37.383

And is she not right?  LIDDON-1889-2,37.384

Nearly nineteen centuries have passed since she spoke;
LIDDON-1889-2,37.385

and what man of average information, interested only in the concerns which
affect our race, has not heard of the Virgin Mary?  LIDDON-1889-2,37.386

A man $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help hearing of her; so conspicuously does
she loom in the pages of human history.  LIDDON-1889-2,37.387

True enough it is that around the solid records in the Gospels respecting
her, religious imagination has been especially busy.  LIDDON-1889-2,37.388

<P_38>

Early in the history of Christendom there were documents, which the early
Church rejected as apocryphal, and in which Mary's birth and infancy , and
the exceptional distinctions supposed to have been accorded to her after
her death, are described with a freedom which might have passed as poetry
if only it had not been treated as sacred prose.  LIDDON-1889-2,38.390

Into this subject it is not consistent with our present purpose to enter.
LIDDON-1889-2,38.391

Suffice it to say, that whatever the exaggerations and fables which
have thus gathered around the name of Mary, they $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
obscure the greatness which is assigned to her in the pages of the Gospel
, while in their wildest forms they should remind us to the place which
she herself claimed to occupy, and has occupied ever since her death,
in the minds of man.  LIDDON-1889-2,38.392

Compare Mary, from this point of view, with some of the great ladies
who were nearly or exactly her contemporaries.  LIDDON-1889-2,38.393

While Mary was fetching water day by day from the well of Nazareth, or
gathering <P_39> wood and wild fruits on the hill above the village,
these stately dames, surrounded by a crowd of slaves, swept proudly
through the halls of the Caesar.  LIDDON-1889-2,39.394

But, if we except a professed student of history here or there, what do
men know about them now?  LIDDON-1889-2,39.395

What do you know of Livia, who parted from an honourable husband that
she might be the wife of Augustus; or of Julia, the ill-used daughter of
Augustus and wife of Tiberius; or of Octavia, the sister of Augustus,
whom Antony divorced that he might wed Cleopatra; or of Antonia, the
high-minded daughter of Octavia, who lived, they say, to be poisoned
by her grandson Caligula; or - somewhat later - of such empresses
as Messalina, Agrippina, Poppoea, - better perhaps unmentioned in
a Christian church - who are associated with the courts of Claudius
and Nero.  LIDDON-1889-2,39.396

The names of these ladies were once as familiar to the vast population
of the Empire as are those of the members of our own royal family to
ourselves.  LIDDON-1889-2,39.397

For a few years they filled the thoughts, and - by their crimes or their
misfortunes - they supplied materials for the gossip, of the world.
LIDDON-1889-2,39.398

Now they are, for all practical purposes, forgotten; while the lowly
maiden who was living unknown in a remote province of the vast Empire
that was ruled by their nearest <P_40> relatives, is at this hour more
borne in mind by civilized men than any other member of her sex who
ever lived.  LIDDON-1889-2,40.399

<heading>

II.  LIDDON-1889-2,40.401

<$$heading>

But what is the justification of this astonishing confidence on the
part of Mary that she will be remembered as blessed to the utmost limits
of time?  LIDDON-1889-2,40.403

It is not anything that she has personally achieved.  LIDDON-1889-2,40.404

It is not any grace or excellence peculiar to her mind or character.
LIDDON-1889-2,40.405

That she was personally endowed with graces of the highest excellence
and beauty we may be well assured: LIDDON-1889-2,40.406

in coming among us, the Eternal Son would, by His Spirit, make ready a
fitting temple prepared for Himself.  LIDDON-1889-2,40.407

But Mary dwells on nothing of this kind; on nothing personal to herself.
LIDDON-1889-2,40.408

She only knows that she has been the recipient of an astonishing
privilege, conferred on her by the free bounty of her Creator.
LIDDON-1889-2,40.409

"He That is mighty hath done to me great things; LIDDON-1889-2,40.410

and holy is His Name. "LIDDON-1889-2,40.411

She refers, of course to what was implied in the message of the Angel
Gabriel at the Annunciation: LIDDON-1889-2,40.412

"Hail, thou that are highly favoured, LIDDON-1889-2,40.413

the Lord is with thee: LIDDON-1889-2,40.414

blessed art thou among women.  {COM:ellipsis} LIDDON-1889-2,40.415

<P_41>

Fear not, Mary: LIDDON-1889-2,41.417

for thou hast found favour with God.  {COM:ellipsis} LIDDON-1889-2,41.418

Thou shalt bring forth a Son, LIDDON-1889-2,41.419

and shall call his Name Jesus.  LIDDON-1889-2,41.420

He shall be great, LIDDON-1889-2,41.421

and shall be called the Son of the Highest: LIDDON-1889-2,41.422

and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David:
LIDDON-1889-2,41.423

and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; LIDDON-1889-2,41.424

and of His kingdom there shall be no end. "LIDDON-1889-2,41.425

And in answer to Mary's expression of wonder the Angel added,"The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, LIDDON-1889-2,41.426

and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: LIDDON-1889-2,41.427

therefore also that Holy Thing Which shall be born of thee shall be
called the Son of God. "LIDDON-1889-2,41.428

Mary had received these assurances in submissive faith.
LIDDON-1889-2,41.429

"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; LIDDON-1889-2,41.430

be it unto me according to thy word. "LIDDON-1889-2,41.431

And they were the warrant of the confidence which she expresses, that
"all generations shall call me blessed. "LIDDON-1889-2,41.432

How, indeed, could it be otherwise, if she was to be the Mother of the
superhuman Heir of David's throne and promises?  if He Who was to be
born of her was, in virtue of the supernatural conditions of His Birth,
to be recognized as the Son of God?  LIDDON-1889-2,41.433

Nothing that she had done or could have done, nothing that she was or
could have been, could have merited this extraordinary distinction;
LIDDON-1889-2,41.434

and Mary is bent upon <P_42> ascribing it unreservedly to God.
LIDDON-1889-2,42.435

"He That is Mighty hath done great things to me. "LIDDON-1889-2,42.436

Be careful to observe that Mary dwells here, not on her person, but on
her office in the economy of the Incarnation.  LIDDON-1889-2,42.437

Not once in the Magnificat does she let fall a single word which points
to a sense of personal desert or excellence; LIDDON-1889-2,42.438

her joy is that"He That is Mighty hath done great things to me.
"LIDDON-1889-2,42.439

And she adds,"Holy is His Name. "LIDDON-1889-2,42.440

She does not understand why she should have been singled out for such
high honour; LIDDON-1889-2,42.441

but she is sure that, since He wills it, all is well.
LIDDON-1889-2,42.442

For His Name, which is to her apprehension inseparable from, since it
unveils his Nature, is Holy.  LIDDON-1889-2,42.443

Holiness is the rule and measure of that which He ordains.
LIDDON-1889-2,42.444

Elisabeth had wondered,"Whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord
should come to me? "LIDDON-1889-2,42.445

Mary does not repudiate the honour; LIDDON-1889-2,42.446

to have done so would have been to make little of God's bounty.
LIDDON-1889-2,42.447

But she insists that she is whatever she is by the grace and favour of
God, LIDDON-1889-2,42.448

and in this respect is on a level with all His creatures.
LIDDON-1889-2,42.449

In all this is she not an example to a age like ours, which has no
very robust faith in the Presence and the gifts of God, but does pay
exceptional homage to the merits or accomplishments of individual
<P_43> men?  LIDDON-1889-2,43.450

Even the modern Church of Christ has not wholly escaped the disposition
to think less of a sacred office than of the man who holds it; to dwell
lightly on the gift or the commission which is common to the holder
with all his brethren, and to devote exceptional attention to anything
that is strictly peculiar to the man, and that may be supposed to be
the product of his own industry or character.  LIDDON-1889-2,43.451

It may well be that we of the clergy have not always been sufficiently on
our guard against a tendency to disparage the ministerial character which
Christ has given us in comparison with some fancied or real endowments
which we dream of as our own.  LIDDON-1889-2,43.452

Any such mistake is tacitly rebuked by Mary in her Magnificat.
LIDDON-1889-2,43.453

She never leads us to think of what she personally is;
LIDDON-1889-2,43.454

but we do not for a moment forget that she is by office the Mother of
the Divine Redeemer.  LIDDON-1889-2,43.455

Indeed, when we review the terms in which she refers to her surpassing
privilege, it is impossible not to be struck with their guarded and
reserved tone.  LIDDON-1889-2,43.456

"He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden;" LIDDON-1889-2,43.457

"He That is mighty hath done to me great things"LIDDON-1889-2,43.458

We wonder, perhaps, that she is not more explicit; that, knowing what she
knows of her extraordinary place in the order of <P_44> Divine Providence,
she does not say more about it; does not, at least in outline, describe
what it is.  LIDDON-1889-2,44.459

"He That is mighty hath done to me great things. "LIDDON-1889-2,44.460

An ordinary Christian might say as much, we think, after recovering
from a dangerous illness, or after a spiritual change, which had altered
profoundly all his views and purposes in life.  LIDDON-1889-2,44.461

Mary is designated as Mother of the Eternal Son; LIDDON-1889-2,44.462

she is, as the poet says with literal truth,"favoured beyond archangel's
dream;"LIDDON-1889-2,44.463

and yet she might seem to desire to draw a veil over her prerogatives,
by phrases which, while implying, in her mouth, something extraordinary ,
convey no definite idea of what it is.  LIDDON-1889-2,44.464

Can we venture in any way to account for this?  LIDDON-1889-2,44.465
