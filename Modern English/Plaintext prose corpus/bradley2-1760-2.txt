The British Housewife: or, The <font> Cook, Housekeeper's, and Gardiner's
<$$font> Companion.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.4

SECT. I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.5

<font> of the Nature of fresh Provisions, Pickles, and Preserves.
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.6

CHAP. I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.7

<font> Of fresh Provisions in general.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.8

<$$heading>

We are to conduct the Cook and House-Keeper throughout the Year,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.10

and we begin with the first Month.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.11

<font> January <$$font> is a dead Season: BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.12

In the Course of this Month there is less Variety than in any other;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.13

the Cook therefore is with her utmost Care to make the best of what
Nature affords: BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.14

and we shall instruct her to do that to the greatest Advantage.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.15

We shall here by way of Introduction to the rest, lay before her a general
List or Catalogue of fresh Provisions, that she may in one View see her
Store; BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.16

and we shall, in their proper Places, enter more particularly on their
Qualities and Choice.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.17

This is to be considered as a Chapter of Rembrance rather than
Instruction.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.18

It contains what every one knows, but none is ever to forget.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,3.19

<P_4>

These Provisions are supply'd from four principal Sources, the <font>
Field, <$$font> the <font> Yard, <$$font> the <font> Pond, <$$font>
and the <font> Garden.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.21

From the Field we have the substantial Part, <font> Meat <$$font> of
all Kinds; from the Yard <font> Poultry <$$font>; from the Pond <font>
Fish <$$font>; and from the Garden <font> Greens, Roots <$$font> and
<font> Fruits.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.22

We shall here give a general Catalogue of them together, and hereafter ,
in the Bill of Fare for this and the succeeding Months, shew which of
them are most, and which least in Season; which in their Prime, and
which entirely out.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.23

We have Meat principally from three Sources, the Ox, the Sheep, and the
Hog; BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.24

and from each of these there are several Kinds of Provision, according
to their Age and Management.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.25

From the <font> Ox <$$font> Kind we have <font> Beef <$$font> and
<font> Veal <$$font>; from <font> Sheep, Mutton <$$font> and <font> Lamb
<$$font>; and from the <font> Hog, Bacon, Pork <$$font>, and <font> Pig.
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.26

To these we are to add <font> Venison, <$$font> the Flesh of the <font>
Deer; <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.27

and if we subjoin the Flesh of the <font> Kid, Hares <$$font> and <font>
Rabbets, <$$font> we have in our View all that is furnished by the
four-footed Kind.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.28

The <font> Poultry <$$font> of our Yard are a small Part of the Store
we receive from the winged Kind; BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.29

for those which live wild are more numerous and more valuable.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.30

Among the tame we are to reckon the common <font> Fowl, <$$font> the
<font> Turkey, <$$font> the <font> Goose, <$$font> and <font> Ducks ;
<$$font> to which we may occasionally add the <font> Swan <$$font>
and <font> Peacock.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.31

To the Cock and Hen kind we may also add the <font> Pheasant <$$font>
since it approaches very much to their Nature, and is in a manner kept
tame in many Places.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.32

Among the common Fowls, the Chicken, the Green Goose and the Duckling
differ from the full-grown of their Kinds, in the same manner as Lamb
from Mutton, Veal from Beef, and the like.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.33

Among the wild Fowl are to be reckoned the Wild Duck and its Kind,
the Teal and Widgeon; the Woodcock, Snipe, and Partridge; the Pigeon,
Lark and other small Birds.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,4.34

The other lesser Particulars will be enumerated in their proper <P_5>
Months, with the Ways of dressing: BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.35

This is a general Table.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.36

Fish are extremely numerous, BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.37

and they fall under two distinct Heads, as they are had from the <font>
Sea <$$font> or <font> fresh Waters.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.38

From the Sea we have <font> Turbot, Cod, Soal, Haddock Doree, <$$font>
and a Multitude of others; down to the Whiting and Herring, and that
small but elegant Fish, the Smelt.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.39

The fresh Waters afford the <font> Pike <$$font> and <font> Pearch,
<$$font> the <font> Carp <$$font> and <font> Tench, Salmon, Trout
<$$font>, and <font> Eels, <$$font> with others down to the <font>
Gudgeon <$$font>.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.40

And to these we are to add the <font> Shell-Fish <$$font> of the Sea;
the <font> Oyster, Escalop, Cockle, <$$font> and the like; and those
Kinds which are called <font> Crustaceous Fish, <$$font> such as the
<font> Lobster <$$font> and <font> Crab, <$$font> as well as others
, down to the <font> Shrimp, <$$font> from the Sea, and the <font>
Cray-Fish <$$font> from the fresh Waters.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.41

We come last to the fresh Provisions from the Garden; BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.42

these come in a lower Class than the others, because they are rather
Additions to Dishes than such themselves, BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.43

but they are of great Value.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.44

Among the principal Greens may be reckoned the <font> Cabbage, Brocoli
, Cauliflower <$$font> and <font> Spinage, <$$font> to which we may
add, <font> Celeri, Lettuce, Radish <$$font> and <font> Salleting;
Asparagus, Beans, Pease, <$$font> and <font> French Beans.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.45

Among Roots we have the <font> Carrot, Parsnip, Turnip <$$font> and
<font> Potatoe.  <$$font> And among Fruits the <font> Apple, Pear,
Plumb, Wallnut, Chestnut <$$font> and <font> Filberd <$$font>; with
the <font> Melon, <$$font> and <font> Cucumber <$$font>; Fruits of the
Kitchen Garden.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.46

This is in one View a general Table of these Provisions,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.47

and may be called <font> A Bill of Fare for the Year.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.48

It is the first Thing the House-Keeper should have before her Eye,
because it should be always in her Memory.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.49

None of the Catalogues are here compleat in the lesser Articles,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.50

for that is the Business of the succeeding Parts of the Book, in which
we treat of the Months in which the Things are particularly in, Season ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.51

and here it would have loaded and perplexed the Memory.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,5.52

These are the best and principal <P_6> Kinds, BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.53

and are proper Resources of a Table: BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.54

So much therefore ought never to be out of the Person's Thoughts who is
to provide.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.55

<heading>

CHAP. II.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.57

<font> Of foreign Articles pickled or otherwise preserved.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.58

<$$heading>

Next to the Provisions themselves, the Cook will have Occasion to
recollect what those Things are which serve to give them Flavour, or to
eat with them as Additions in Sauce, or such as supply the Place of it.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.60

Under this Head come Pickles, and other preserved Things of that Kind;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.61

Of these there is a vast Number, BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.62

but the greater Part of them are prepared at Home.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.63

Some we receive from other Countries.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.64

The former Kind will be treated of hereafter in their Places, according
to the Times they are in Season.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.65

The latter, or foreign, we shall speak of here.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.66

These are principally six, Anchovies, Capers, Caviar, Cayan Pepper,
Mangoes, and Soy.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.67

Of these we shall give some Account under their several Names, each in
a separate Article, shewing their Nature and Origin.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.68

<heading>

ARTICLE I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.70

<font> ANCHOVIES.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.71

<$$heading>

The Anchovy is a small Sea fish somewhat like a Pilchard, but of a
distinct Kind; BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.73

$it's proper Name is Encrasicholus.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.74

It is preserved with Salt and $it's own Juices, which dissolving the
Salt make with it that very rich and high Pickle in which we see it.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.75

It is caught upon the Coasts of Provence and Catalonia three Months in
the Year, BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.76

these are May, June, and July.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.77

It does not appear there before May, BRADLEY2-1760-2,6.78

and toward the End of July it goes up the <P_7> Straights of Gibraltar
into the Mediterranean, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.79

and is seen no more till the following Summer.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.80

They are caught in the Night-time by Means of a Light.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.81

The Fishermen go out in small Vessels with Lanthorns at the Stern.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.82

The Flame brings the Anchovies about, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.83

and they take them in their Nets.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.84

When caught they have very little farther Trouble with them.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.85

They cut off the Heads, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.86

for they are bitter, the Gaul lying high; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.87

and they pull out the Guts; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.88

they then lay them regularly in Barrels BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.89

and strew Bay Salt upon them, Layer upon Layer.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.90

Nothing more is done, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.91

for the Richness of their Taste is all their own.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.92

This shews the Folly of attempting to imitate them with Sprats and
other Fishes.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.93

What we value in the Anchovy is the fine Flavour of the Fish itself,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.94

no other has it.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.95

At the Oil Shops they have a Trick of putting right Anchovy Liquor to
pickled Sprats, and then selling them for Anchovies; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.96

and this may deceive the Unwary, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.97

but no other Way can.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.98

The finest are those which have the fairest Look, and the richest Liquor;
that have a red mellow Flesh, and a moist oily Bone.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.99

But the true Way to judge of them is to wash one and open it, and then
taste the pure Flesh.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.100

This should be high flavoured; and the Pickle redish and of a high
Flavour also; BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.101

if watery and poor, it is not the original Pickle.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.102

This will never suffer the Person who considers the true Taste of an
Anchovy to be deceived.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.103

Sprats are made to taste like them by the Pickle, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.104

but that washes off this Way, BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.105

and the Cheat is seen.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.106

<heading>

ARTICLE II.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.108

<font> CAPERS.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.109

<$$heading>

Capers are the Flower-Buds of a small Shrub preserved in Pickle.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.111

The Tree which bears them is called the Caper Shrub or Caper Bush,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.112

and is common in the western Parts of Europe: BRADLEY2-1760-2,7.113

We have it also <P_8> in some Gardens.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.114

But the principal Manufactory for the pickled Capers is near Toulon.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.115

The true high flavoured swelling Capers are the Toulon Kind;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.116

We have some from Lyons, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.117

but they are flatter and less firm; BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.118

and some few are brought from Majorca, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.119

but they are salt and washy.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.120

At Toulon, where the finest are made, the Method is this;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.121

they gather the Buds of the Blossoms before they open,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.122

and spread them upon a Floor in a Room where there is no Sun,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.123

and let them lie till they begin to wither; BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.124

then they throw them into Tubs of sharp Vinegar, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.125

and after three Days add a Quantity of Bay Salt.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.126

When this is dissolved they are fit for packing up for Sale,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.127

and are sent to all Parts of Europe.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.128

The finest Capers are those of a moderate Size, firm, full and close,
and such as have the Pickle highly flavoured.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.129

The soft and flabby, and half open, are of little Value.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.130

<heading>

ARTICLE III.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.132

<font> CAVIARE.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.133

<$$heading>

Caviare is the Roe of the Sturgeon prepar'd and dry'd.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.135

Sturgeon are prodigiously numerous about the Mouths of Rivers
in the Northern Seas, particularly at the Mouth of the Volga.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.136

They are caught there in vast plenty, and the Flesh eat fresh or pickled ,
as we shall shew hereafter.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.137

The Females are, in the proper Season, as full of Roe as our Carp;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.138

this is taken out, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.139

they spread it upon great Tables, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.140

beat it flat, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.141

and sprinkle Salt upon it immediately; BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.142

they let in the Air and Sun, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.143

and turning it at times it quickly begins to dry: BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.144

When half dry they beat it more, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.145

and form it into Cakes, which they thoroughly dry in Ovens, though
without.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.146

In this Condition it is sent all over Russia, BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.147

and vast Quantities are imported here.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,8.148

<P_9>

The Italian Merchants settled at Moscow are the people who principally
trade in it.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.150

We have a great deal of it from Archangel, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.151

but export the most of it again.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.152

It is a very high flavoured thing, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.153

and when good is redish, firm, and strong to the Taste.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.154

When too soft or crumbling, it is always bad.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.155

<heading>

ARTICLE IV.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.157

<font> CAYAN PEPPER.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.158

<$$heading>

The Fruit of a Plant of a lively full red Colour, prepar'd by drying
and powdering.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.160

As we got the taste for Caviare from Russia, we imported this from the
Negroes of our Plantations.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.161

The Fruit is common in Africa, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.162

and they having been accustomed to eat it there, shewed our People the
Way in America, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.163

and they have taught us.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.164

The Herb which bears this Pod is raised in our Gardens;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.165

its proper Name is Capsicum, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.166

and from its growing in Africa it is called Guinea Pepper, as Cayan Pepper
from its natural Growth in that Part of America.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.167

The Pods are as long as one's Thumb, and somewhat thicker;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.168

when ripe they are of a smooth, glossy, fine red Colour, whence they
are called Garden Corall.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.169

We preserve these in the way of a Pickle at home; BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.170

the Method shall be shewn in its proper Place.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.171

We are here speaking of the Powder made of them abroad, and imported.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.172

This is call'd Cayan Pepper, and by some improperly Cayanne Butter.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.173

The Pods are gathered when full ripe and split open, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.174

the Seeds are taken out, and the split Pods laid to dry in the Sun.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.175

When thoroughly dry it is beat to a coarse Powder.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.176

This Powder is Cayan Pepper in the plainest Way, BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.177

but there are many Varieties of it.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.178

Some mix Bay Salt with it, and others Powder of dry'd Mushroons:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.179

These three Kinds are made from the common Plant which is called by the
Indians Chili, and Chilcotes.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,9.180

<P_10>

But besides this there are three distinct Sorts made from so many
different Species of the Plant, and varying in Strength and Sharpness.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.182

The first of these is made from a small Pod of a yellowish red when ripe.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.183

This is sharper than the common Sort, BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.184

and is call'd by them Chilterpin.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.185

The second is made from a larger Pod, which though red when ripe is
often gathered while green; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.186

this is moderately hot, but with a very fine Flavour:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.187

They call this Tonalchiles.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.188

The last Kind is the mildest of all; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.189

it is a short but thicker Pod, BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.190

and is called Chilpelagua.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.191

We seldom have any but the common Kind brought over here;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.192

but the second Sort here mention'd is much better.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.193

When this Pepper is to be bought, the Person must examine whether it be
genuine, for a great deal is adulterated; and in the next Place whether
it be pure or have Salt mix'd with it; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.194

for this naturally reduces the Value by encreasing the Quantity.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.195

We have of late try'd the making it here, by drying our own Capsicum
Pods from the Gardens; BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.196

this does not come up to the Heat or Flavour of the Foreign;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.197

but mix'd with Bay Salt and Mushroon Powder, it makes a very mild and
pretty Kind.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.198

The French use these Pods fresh in making of Vinegar, to give it a
Sharpness, BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.199

and they also pickle and preserve them: BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.200

Pickled they are very fine, as we shall shew hereafter.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.201

<heading>

CHAP. III.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.203

<font> Of Spices and other Ingredients used in pickling and preserving
at Home.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.204

<$$heading>

The two great Ingredients used in all pickling and preserving are <font>
Vinegar <$$font> and <font> Sugar.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,10.206

The first of these being made at Home we shall treat of <P_11> hereafter
, shewing the Manner of making it, $it's various Kinds, and $it's
Distillation.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.207

At present we treat of Things brought from abroad, of which Sugar is
properly one, BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.208

for though refined here, it is the Produce of another Part of the World
, BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.209

The Spices and various Kinds of Salt, are the other chief Ingredients
used in this Article; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.210

and as the former are entirely brought from abroad, and most of the
others, we shall treat of them together.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.211

We shall begin with the Spices, because they are used both in pickling
and preserring, and thence come to the Salts, treating of the Sugars
separately at last.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.212

The principal Spices used in England are <font> Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs
, Cinnamon, Ginger, Pepper, <$$font> and that Fruit called <font>
Allspice, <$$font> or Jamaica Pepper, which has the Flavour of them all.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.213

In the East Indies, as we have observed, they use Galangals, Turmerick ,
and several other Drugs under the same Name; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.214

but these we have nothing to do with in this Account.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.215

We shall treat of the others in so many separate Articles.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.216

<heading>

ARTICLE I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.218

<font> CLOVES.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.219

<$$heading>

The Clove is the Produce of a large and beautiful Tree,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.221

and is the unripe Fruit with the Cup of the Flower; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.222

the Tree has Leaves like the Bay, and very finely flavoured both for
Smell and Taste; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.223

the Clove is green at the first Appearance, BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.224

but it soon grows brownish BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.225

and is then gathered, very long before it comes toward Ripeness;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.226

what are left on the Trees grow very large, BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.227

and alter their Shape; BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.228

they are call'd the Mother of Cloves.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.229

The unripe Fruit is gathered in the Middle of the Day and laid in a shady,
airy Place to dry, BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.230

and nothing else is done to it.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,11.231

<P_12>

We have Cloves from the Dutch; BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.233

they have destroyed the Trees in the Molucca Islands, and propagated them
in their Island of Ternate; so that they supply all the European Nations.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.234

The Tree is called Caryophyllus, which is also the Name of the Fruit.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.235

The best Cloves are such as are dry, brittle, dark coloured, and fiery
hot to the Taste, and of a quick Smell.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.236

ARTICLE II.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.238

<font> MACE and NUTMEG.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.239

<$$heading>

These, though two Spices, and very different in Form and Appearance ,
are to be treated of together, because they are both produced by the same
Tree, and are two Parts of one and the same Fruit.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.241

The Nutmeg Tree is large and beautiful, BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.242

the Leaves are long and of a fine green, BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.243

and the Flower is like an Apple Blossom; BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.244

the Fruit is round, and of the Bigness of a Peach, which it in all
Respects resembles.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.245

The fleshy Part is not valued, BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.246

but within it, by Way of Kernel, lies the Nutmeg, which is covered with
the Mace; BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.247

the Fruit is cut open, the Mace opened and taken off, and that and
the Nutmeg dried in a cool airy Place, and then sent over to us.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.248

Some distinguish the Nutmeg into Male and Female.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.249

In this Case the common Nutmeg is called the Female;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.250

the other is longish and less valuable.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.251

They are produced by the same Tree, but the Male by such as are less
cultivated.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.252

It is the Produce of the East-Indies.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.253

The best Mace is that which is oily, soft, and fragrant.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.254

The Nutmeg should be found, hard, and heavy, of a pale Colour on the
Outside, and finely marbled within.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.255

The Nutmegs differ according to the Season of gathering,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.256

the best are those gathered in April.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,12.257

The Dutch supply us with Nutmegs and Mace, as they do <P_13> with
Cloves; the whole Spice Trade being in a Manner in their Hands.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.258

ARTICLE III.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.260

<font> CINNAMON.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.261

<$$heading>

Cinnamon is the inner Bark of a large and beautiful Tree which grows in
the East-Indies; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.263

the Leaves are like those of the Bay Tree, and of a very fine, and spicey
Taste, and most agreeable Smell.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.264

The Bark, when fresh, has little Taste BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.265

it gains a great deal of it's Flavour as it dries.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.266

It is the most agreeable of all the Spices; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.267

the finest is that which is in small Quills, of a bright Colour and
strong Smell, and of a sharp and biting Taste.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.268

Sometimes an Oil is drawn from Cinnamon before it is brought over to us
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.269

then, it is very insipid: BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.270

And often Cassia Bark is sold among it, BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.271

but that is much inferior in Value; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.272

the Taste is the true Way to judge, BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.273

for that which has lost $it's Oil is less sharp and quick than it should
be; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.274

and the Cassia comes to a Kind of Jelly after holding some Time in
the Mouth.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.275

The Dutch supply all Europe with Cinnamon, which they have in the Islands
of Ceylon in such Abundance that they burn a great deal annually to keep
up the Price.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.276

CHAP. IV.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.278

<font> Of the Nature of Foods, and suiting them to Constitutions.
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.279

<$$heading>

Although the pleasing of the Palate be the main End in Books of
Cookery, we carry the Consideration in this a little farther.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.281

We shall throughout have Regard to the Health as well as the Appetite:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.282

For it is of greater Concern; BRADLEY2-1760-2,13.283

neither can the other.  <P_14> exist without it.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.284

If there were any Man so devoted to his Pleasure in eating, that he
consulted no other, yet the Care of his Health becomes a Part of that,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.285

for if sick he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} relish his Food.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.286

Constitutions are various, BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.287

and they require a different Kind of Diet to keep them well.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.288

Nature has provided in the same manner a great Variety of Foods:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.289

Our Business is to suit these to one another.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.290

There is no Way to do this but by understanding both; which we shall
endeavour here to explain in a very short Compass.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.291

In general Meat is of the heaviest, Fowls of a lighter, and Fish of the
lightest Kind; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.292

they are easy of Digestion in Proportion as they are light in their
Nature; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.293

but on the other Hand they are a richer and stronger Nourishment when
they are of a firmer Texture.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.294

Thus the richest Foods are the several Kinds of Flesh Meat, though there
are some of the Fish kinds extremely nourishing.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.295

The Shell Fish are a Class distinct from all the others, and of a peculiar
Nature, easy of Digestion, and very nourishing.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.296

This is a general Idea of the Nature of Foods: BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.297

We are next to enquire into the Differences of Constitutions, for the
suiting one to the other.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.298

There are two Ways in which the Food is to be suited to the Constitution
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.299

the one is for the Recovery of Health; BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.300

this rather falls under the Consideration of the Physician,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.301

however we shall give some Directions concerning it, so far as is
consistent with our Plan: BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.302

The other is for the preserving of Health, BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.303

and this comes directly and immediately in our Way, BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.304

and should be one material End in all Works of this Kind.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.305

Constitutions depend upon the Temperament of the Body,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.306

and may be divided into four Kinds, with respect to the Effects of Food.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.307

These are the <font> Sanguine, <$$font> the <font> Bilious, <$$font>
the <font> Phlegmatick, <$$font> and the <font> Melancholick.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.308

The two first are in some Degree ally'd to one another, and the two
other more.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,14.309

This is all the Distinction <P_15> needful for the Consideration of
appropriating the Food; BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.310

and therefore the general Direction will divide Eatables for this
Purpose only into two Heads; one Class of them being fit for the
Sanguine and Bilious; and other for the Phlegmatick and Melancholick;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.311

and these two Classes are to be again divided, according to their
particular Kinds, into such as are fittest for the one; and such
as agree best with the other of the two lesser Distinctions.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.312

The Nature of these several Constitutions is this.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.313

The Person who is <font> Sanguine <$$font> has a good Colour in his Cheeks
and a moderate Quantity of Flesh upon his Body, BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.314

and is naturally of an easy Temper and chearful Disposition.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.315

He who is of a bilious Constitution has a more set Colour in his Face,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.316

he is thinner in Flesh, and his Temper naturally quick and hasty.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.317

These are the two Constitutions which are somewhat allied to one another
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.318

the sanguine is the most healthful, and most agreeable,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.319

and the bilious is a Fault of it.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.320

The Person who is phlegmatick is of a pale Complexion, moderately fleshy
, BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.321

but the Flesh is not firm, and his Temper naturally sedate;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.322

he is dull and inactive, BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.323

and is the very opposite of the bilious Constitution.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.324

The Melancholick Constitution shews itself by a lean Body, and little
Colour in the Cheeks; BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.325

the Temper attending this Constitution is generally a grave and severe
Disposition, BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.326

and the Person is apt to be absent, solitary, and careless.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.327

A Man is most perfectly healthful when he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be
properly said to be of any one of these Constitutions but when he is in
a middle Degree between them: As that Temper is best which is neither
so quick as in the bilious, nor so slow as in the phlegmatick Person;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.328

so that State of Body is most healthful in which a Man is neither
so red in the Cheeks as in the first, or so pale as in the latter.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,15.329

What is called the sanguine Constitution, when in a moderate Degree,
is <P_16> the most healthful; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.330

but it is seldom called by that Name, except when it somewhat exceeds
that Degree.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.331

A Man should first acquaint himself with his Constitution, which he may
do by this short Account, examining himself according to these Articles
; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.332

and when he knows this, he is to manage his Diet in such a Manner as to be
continually improving his Health by moderating the Occasions of whatever
is redundant, whether Blood, Gall, or whatever.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.333

And thus he will escape the murderous Hand of the Physician.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.334

The Regulation of the Diet, and the proper Use of Exercise, are the
right Restorers of Health; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.335

the Effect of Medicines is too violent; BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.336

and with due Care in this Respect they will be rarely needed.

BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.342

<$$heading>

We shall divide the particular Bill of Fare for every Month under
certain Heads, as we did the general Table of Provisions, and in each
enumerate not only what Kind is in Season, but what Parts or Joints
are most handsome at Table; in what Manner they appear best, and with
what Additions.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.344

We shall begin with the most substantial.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.345

Soups are made from this Kind, BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.346

and are now very proper.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,16.347

ARTICLE I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.350

<font> BUTCHERS MEAT.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.351

<$$heading>

<font> Beef <$$font> is a kind of Standard Dish, and in Season more or
less throughout the whole Year.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.353

At this Time the Sirloin, or some other good Piece roasted, with
Horse-radish, or the Rump or Ach-Bone boil'd with Greens look well.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.354

From the same Source we have also for this time Tongue and Udder.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.355

A Brisket of Beef stew'd is also proper.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.356

A Chine of Mutton roasted is also good, or any of the other handsome
Joint.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.357

Veal supplies many very good and proper Dishes; as the Loin, Neck,
or Fillet roasted; the Knuckle boiled with Bacon and Greens, the Head
boil'd in the same manner, or roasted, and Ragouts and Scots Collops.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.358

Of Lamb we have the Leg boil'd with Spinage, or the Quarter.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.359

From the Hog Kind we have the Leg of Pork boil'd with Turnips, and Pease
Pudding; and the Pig roasted.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.360

There is also Bacon; BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.361

for that is in Season all the Year, with Greens or Fowls.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.362

The Hog's Head collar'd is good; and the Pig collared;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.363

and the Collar of Brawn is a standing Dish at this Time.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.364

Pickled Pork is also in Season, BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.365

and may be us'd as Bacon, and the Chine with a Turkey.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.366

To the Meat Kind we are to add the Hare in Season now; and dry'd Tongues
of various Kinds as Side Dishes.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,17.367

Greens and Roots in Season in <font> January <$$font> are <font>
Cabbages <$$font> and <font> Savoys, Carrots, Parsneps, Turneps, Potatoes,

and <font> Endive: <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.384

These are in the common Ground.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.385

From Hot-Beds there are <font> Lettuces, <$$font> and young <font>
Salleting, <$$font> as Cresses, Turnep, Radish, Mustard, and Chervil ;
Coriander, Tarragon, and young Mint: BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.386

And there will be <font> Asparagus <$$font> upon the Beds made in November

<font> FRUITS.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.392

<$$heading>

We see the Land and Waters afford plenty of Provisions at this Season,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.394

nor can we want Herbs and Roots: BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.395

Fruit is one of the Articles least numerous at this dead time,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.396

yet we are not without a Supply for the Table.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,18.397

There are several excellent Pears in Season now, as the Lessacherie,
Colmar, Virgoleuse, Ambrette, Epine d'Hyver, St. Germain,
St. Austin, Winter Beurre, Citron d'Hyver, Rousselette d'Hyver,
Francreal, and Bugi; the Rouville, Patail, Besiy de <P_19> Caissoy,
and the Beside Cheaumontelle.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.398

These are for eating; BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.399

they keep them on Espaliers, where they hang longer than on Walls.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.400

For baking there are the Cadillac, the black Worcester Pear, the English
Warden, and the Pickering.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.401

Apples in Season at this time are the Golden Pippin, Nonpariel,
Golden Russet, Wheeler's Russet, and Pile's Russet; the French Pippin,
Harvey Apple, Kentish Pippin, Holland Pippin, Aromatick Pippin, and
Kirton Pippin; the Winter Pearmain, Monstrous Rennet, Pear Russet,
and Aromatick Russet; the John Apple, Winter Queening, and Pomme Roy.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.402

Besides the Pear and Apple Kind, there are Nuts, Almonds, Services,
and Medlars.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.403

Grapes are also to be had with proper Care: BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.404

The Way is to cut the Bunches with a Knot or Shoot, and hang them separate
in a dry airy Room.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.405

These are the Things in Season for the Month of <font> January.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.406

The Housekeeper sees what she may command, BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.407

and we shall proceed to shew her how she is to chuse, and afterwards
how to order them.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.408

CHAP. VI.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.410

<font> Of the Art of Marketing and chusing Fresh Provisions.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.411

<$$heading>

The great Number of Articles will necessarily render this a long Chapter
, BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.413

but we shall separate it into several Divisions.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.414

We have shewn what is in Season in January, BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.415

and the Housekeeper is to consider what she will purchase:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.416

the next Care is how to chuse it, BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.417

for there are good and bad of all Kinds; BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.418

and if the Provision is not good in itself, no dressing can make it so.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.419

Those who sell are ready to impose upon the Buyer, BRADLEY2-1760-2,19.420

she is therefore to be guided by just <P_20> Rules in every Article,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.421

and must trust to her own Reason, not their Speeches.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.422

- We shall begin with Butchers Meat.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.423

<heading>

ARTICLE I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.425

<font> Of chusing BEEF <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.426

<$$heading>

In order to buy Beef, the first Thing is to know rightly what are the
Joints and Pieces.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.428

The first Division is into three Parts, the Quarters, the Head, and
the Entrails.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.429

The Quarters are two, the <font> Fore <$$font> and the <font> Hind;
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.430

in the Fore Quarter there is the Haunch; BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.431

this is a large Piece, BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.432

and includes what may be called four Joints; BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.433

these are, the <font> Clod, <$$font> the <font> Marrow-bone, <$$font>
the <font> Shin, <$$font> and, the <font> Sticking-piece.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.434

Next to the Haunch comes what is called the Leg of Mutton Piece;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.435

this has Part of the Blade Bone.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.436

Then there are these four, the Chuck-piece, the Brisket, the Fore Ribs,
and the Middle Rib.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.437

This last is what is called the Chuck Rib.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.438

These Pieces compose the Fore Quarter.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.439

In the Hind Quarter there are fewer, BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.440

but they are much finer Pieces; BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.441

there are the Sirloin, the Rump, the Thick Flank, the Thin Flank
, the Veiny Piece, the Chuck Bone, the Buttock, and the Leg.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.442

After these Quarters may be named the <font> Head, <$$font> which consists
of the Cheek, Tongue, and Palate; and the <font> Entrails <$$font> which
are, the Sweat-bread and Kidneys; then the Skirt and Tripe; of these
Kinds the Double, the Roll, and the Reed Tripe.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.443

Beef is of three Kinds, <font> Ox, Cow, <$$font> and <font> Bull.
<$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.444

The first is vastly the best, the latter scarce ever brought to Market.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.445

As to Cow Beef $it's Degree of Goodness depends upon the Age;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.446

a Cow past Use is fattened and killed, BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.447

and this is poor: BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.448

But the Beef of a young Heifer is very nearly as good as that of the Ox.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.449

The Housekeeper is therefore to buy Ox Beef, or young Heifer:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,20.450

We shall not advise her to take the Butcher's <P_21> Word, but shew how
she may know one from the other.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.451

In this Article of Marketing to avoid perplexing the Memory, we
shall speak only of those Things we have before mentioned as being in
Season this Month, and afterwards in the proper Months of the others.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.452

The Grain of Beef is a great Mark; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.453

Ox Beef has a fine open Grain; Cow Beef a lesser; and Bull Beef the
closest Grain of all.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.454

When Ox Beef is perfectly fine, the Lean is of a bright red, the Fat
whitish, and the Sewet perfectly white.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.455

When this Beef is young, the Fat is soft and oily.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.456

The Lean of Cow Beef is paler than the Ox, BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.457

the Bones are smaller; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.458

as to the Fat, that is no Mark, BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.459

for it is rather whiter than in the Ox BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.460

To know whether it be young press it with the Finger.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.461

In the Heifer Beef the Mark, will rise and fill up at once, not so in
old Cow Beef.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.462

As to Bull Beef it is of a dark red, and so hard the Finger will scarce
press it; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.463

the Fat is gross, BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.464

and has a strong Scent.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.465

ART. II.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.467

<font> MUTTON.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.468

<$$heading>

The Sheep is divided into three Parts like the Ox, the Quarters, the Head,
and the Entrails.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.470

The Fore Quarter contains the Shoulder, Neck, and Breast; the Hind
Quarter, the Leg, and the Loin; except when the two Loins are cut
together, Saddle-Fashion; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.471

the Head and Entrails are usually sold together, the latter being called
the Pluck.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.472

This contains the Liver, Lights, Heart, Sweatbread, and Melt.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.473

More Care is required in chusing Mutton than Beef; BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.474

for besides that it is of several Kinds, as Beef, according to the Age
, Condition, and Sex of the Creature, it is very often distempered.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.475

The Rot is a common Disorder in Sheep, BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.476

and the Flesh of such as have it is unwholsome.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,21.477

To know this, observe the <P_22> Colour of the Meat;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.478

the Lean is very pale coloured, and the Fat yellowish,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.479

and the whole is loose at the Bone.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.480

For trying it farther, let it be squeezed hard, and there will come out
some Drops like Dew upon the Surface.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.481

To know whether Mutton have not been kept too long, examine in this
Manner; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.482

seek for the Vein in the Neck in a Fore Quarter, BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.483

and observe $it's Colour; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.484

it should be red or Violet coloured; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.485

it is always thus when the Meat is perfectly fresh; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.486

if it looks yellowish, the whole is going; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.487

and if it be green, it is too far gone for Use.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.488

The Fore Quarter consists of the Neck, the Breast, and the Shoulder;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.489

the Hind Quarter is composed only of the Leg and the Loin,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.490

or the two Loins may be cut together; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.491

this Piece is called a Saddle of Mutton from $it's Shape, resembling a
Saddle; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.492

and when it is small fat Mutton, this is an excellent Joint.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.493

This was the first Kind that was cut so; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.494

they now cut the largest and coarsest Meat in that Manner,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.495

and it looks very well; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.496

to know whether this Part be sweet smell under the Kidney;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.497

if any thing be amiss, it will be perceived there.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.498

A good Method also is to bend the Knuckle of the Leg;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.499

if that be stiff, the Meat is fresh; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.500

but if it be very limber, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} a very ill Sign.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.501

As to the different kinds of Mutton, the finest is that which feeds upon
dry hilly Pastures, where the Air is clear and the Grass short and sweet;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.502

this is small and finely flavoured, BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.503

and the best Age for killing is between five and six Years.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.504

Most of the Mutton that is eat, is spoiled by being killed too young.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.505

Weather Mutton is best.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.506

The Fat of this is white and firm, BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.507

and parts easily from the Lean; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.508

and the Lean is of a fine Red and a proper Firmness, neither so hard as
not to give Way under the Finger, nor so soft as to wrinkle upon being
touched; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.509

the best Mutton is that which feels tender and somewhat firm, and that
when dented with a Finger quickly rises again.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.510

Ram Mutton is like Bull Beef, BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.511

but it is oftener sold; BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.512

the Lean is very red and of a rough Grain, BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.513

and the Fat is spungy.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,22.514

<P_23>

The longer Mutton is kept, provided it be sweet, the better, especially
a Leg.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.516

<heading>

ART. III.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.518

<font> VEAL.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.519

<$$heading>

The Calf is divided, like the Sheep, into the fore and hind Quarters,
the Head and Entrails.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.521

The fore Quarter contains, in the same Manner, the Shoulder; Breast
, and Neck, and the hind $Quarter {TEXT:Quarrer}, the Leg and Loin:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.522

But the Leg is usually divided into two Parts, the Fillet and the Knuckle.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.523

The Head is split, and sold entire, and in halves.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.524

The Entrails are very fine; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.525

all together they are called the Pluck, BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.526

but they are sold also separate; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.527

they are the Heart, Liver, Lights and Milt, the Skirts, and the two
Sweet-Breads.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.528

As to the Choice, first observe that the Bull-Calf, and Cow-Calf differ ,
the latter being much the finest; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.529

Then besides this natural Difference, there is a great deal owing to
the Artifice of the Feeder and the Butcher; BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.530

for they use more in Veal than in any other Article.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.531

The Bull-Calf has a firm, reddish, and somewhat larger Grain,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.532

and the Fat is wrinkled: BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.533

The Flesh of the Cow-Calf is whiter, evener, and of a finer Grain,
and the Fat smooth.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.534

They wrap up the Veal in Cloths to whiten it, BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.535

and therefore the Buyer must smell if it be not musty.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.536

Veal taints sooner than any other Meat, BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.537

therefore she must see that it be not going when bought,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.538

for then it will soon be gone.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.539

The Loin taints under the Kidney, and the Neck and Breast at the upper
Part, BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.540

this is the Place therefore to be examined.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.541

The Rules laid down for Mutton hold also here, BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.542

the ruddy Colour of the Neck Vein, and the Stiffness of the Knuckle Joint,
are Proofs of Freshness.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.543

When there is a blackish or greenish Look on any Part, it is surely going.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.544

Good Veal, if ever so young, has a proper Firmness, BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.545

when it is soft and flabby it is decaying.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.546

The Sweet-Bread is always good when it is firm and dry,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.547

when it is flabby and clammy it is spoil'd.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,23.548

<P_24>

For the Choice of a Calf's Head examine the Eyes, BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.550

if they be plump and lively it is fresh, BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.551

if sunk in or wrinkled it is gone.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.552

<heading>

ART. IV.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.554

<font> LAMB.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.555

<$$heading>

Lamb is divided in the same Manner as Mutton, into the fore and hind
Quarters, the Head and Entrails; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.557

but under this last Head there is some Distinction.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.558

The fore Quarter is the Neck, Breast and Shoulder, which are
usually roasted together, the Quarter being considered as a Joint.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.559

In the hind Quarter are the Leg and Loin, BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.560

but they are often separated, BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.561

House Lamb is in high Season this Month.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.562

The Head and common Entrails are usually sold together, under the Name
of Head and Pluck, or Head and Appurtenances.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.563

But there is the Fry also; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.564

this is composed of the Lamb-Stones, Sweetbreads, Skirts, and the finest
Part of the Liver.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.565

Lamb is to be chosen as Veal; the Quarters by the Sweetness under the
Kidney, and Freshness of the Neck Vein, and by the Firmness of the
Knuckle Joint.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.566

The Head is to be chosen by the Eyes, as the Calf's; and the Entrails
by smelling.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.567

<heading>

ART. V.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.569

<font> PORK.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.570

<$$heading>

We have observed that the Hog is to be consider'd in three Conditions;
for Bacon, the Porker, and the Sucking Pig.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.572

We shall hereafter treat of the Bacon Hog and of the Pig separately,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.573

we here speak of the Porker.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.574

This is divided as the others into the fore and hind Quarters, the Head
and Entrails; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.575

but there is great Difference in the cutting up of these;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.576

in the fore Quarter there is the Fore-Loin and the Spring;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.577

and where the Porker is large they cut a Spearrib.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.578

The hind Quarter consists of the Leg and Loin.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.579

The Head is like the Hog's, BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.580

and is frequently sous'd; BRADLEY2-1760-2,24.581

the Entrails <P_25> are numerous, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.582

and several of them together are called the Haslet; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.583

this properly consists of the Liver and Crow, and the Kidneys and Skirts ,
rolled up in the Caul.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.584

The Chitterlings are also to be counted among the Entrails, and the Guts
which serve for Sausages.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.585

The Age of the Porker is a great Article, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.586

for if it be too old the Meat is bad; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.587

but there is a farther Caution also necessary, the same as in Mutton,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.588

for the Porker, like the Sheep, is subject to Disorders, which render
the Meat unwholesome.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.589

We shall shew how to chuse it so as to avoid both Faults.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.590

When the Porker is young, the Skin is tender, the Fat fine and smooth,
and the Lean soft and moist.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.591

When this is harsh, the Fat firm, and the Skin hard, it is old.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.592

When there are a great Number of small Kernels in the Fat, the Creature
has been distempered; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.593

this is nearly rotten, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.594

and should not be eaten, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.595

for it is unwholesome.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.596

One Thing in particular makes the Pork bad, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.597

that is when the Hog has not been gelt till he was grown up.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.598

This should be done while they are very young, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.599

and the Flesh is then always fine and tender; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.600

the Flesh is otherwise harder and reder than of the right Porker,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.601

and has a very disagreeable Rankness.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.602

The Skin of this Sort of Pork is thicker, tougher, and coarser than that
of the other, BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.603

and does not join so closely to the Flesh.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.604

To know whether Pork be fresh we judge in the same Way as in other Meats,
by the.  Sweetness; BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.605

it taints first at the Bone that comes out in the Hands and Legs,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.606

and if one thrusts a Finger in there it will be sure to make a Discovery
on smelling when taken out.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.607

When it grows stale also, the Skin is damp and flabby.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,25.608

ART. VI.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.611

<font> Of the BACON HOG.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.612

<$$heading>

The grown Hog is divided differently from all other Beasts, because of the
Bacon, and other particular Uses, as Ham, pickled Pieces, and the like.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.614

The principal Pieces for eating fresh are three, the Spearrib, the Chine,
and the Griskin; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.615

the principal Entrails are called the Liver and Crow, which are good
fried, BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.616

and the Feet and Ears are good souced; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.617

the rest is as the Porker, BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.618

and need not be repeated.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.619

As to the Choice of the fresh Meat it is altogether the same as that of
Pork; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.620

but there are particular Ways of judging of Bacon.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.621

When it is good the Flesh sticks close to the Bones,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.622

and the Fat and Lean stick close to one another.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.623

If this be not the Case it is bad, BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.624

and $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} suspicious that the Hog Was not found.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.625

The next Care must be, that the Bacon be not rusty, nor tending to it ;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.626

to find this, examine the Fat that lies next to the Rind,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.627

if that be dusky it is bad, BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.628

for it should be as white as any other Part; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.629

the Lean also should be red and firm; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.630

when it is Soft and pale the Bacon is getting rusty.

<$$heading>

We have done with those Meats that are cut and separated into Joints,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.636

and come to Animals sold entire.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.637

The roasting Pig is not divided at all, BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.638

and very little is to be said as to $it's Choice; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.639

it should be young, fat, and newly killed; BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.640

it is not like other Meats that are good as long as they are sweet,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.641

the Pig loses Part of $it's Goodness every Hour after it is killed;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.642

to be in Perfection it should always be killed in the Morning to eat at
Dinner, BRADLEY2-1760-2,26.643

ART. VIII.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.646

<font> Of the Hare.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.647

<$$heading>

The Hare is considered in two Lights, in Respect of $it's Age, and
$it's Freshness.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.649

The Age distinguishes it into two Kinds, the Leveret and Hare,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.650

and it may be thus known.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.651

Feel the fore Legs, and there will be found a Knob on each in the Leveret,
which comes out in the grown Hare; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.652

observe the Cleft of the Lip, BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.653

if it be small and close $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} a Leveret;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.654

if wide, large, and spreading, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} an old Hare.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.655

Next examine the Ears, BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.656

if they tear easily the Hare is young; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.657

if they be tough it is an old one.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.658

Lastly, look to the Feet, BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.659

if the Claws be close and smooth $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} a Leveret;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.660

if far apart and ragged the Hare is old.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.661

These Rules will never fail.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.662

As to the Freshness it is thus known; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.663

if the Body be stiff and the Flesh pale, it is newly killed
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.664

when the Flesh is blackish, and the Body limber, it is growing stale;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.665

but $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} never bad till it smells.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.666

ART. IX.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.668

<font> Of the Rabbit.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.669

<$$heading>

The Rabbit is like the Hare in Shape, BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.671

and it is to be examined in the same Manner; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.672

$it's Goodness depends upon $it's being young and sweet.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.673

To know the Age, examine first the Fur, BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.674

if that be delicate and lie smooth, it is a Sign of Youth;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.675

if it be rough and staring, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} suspicious the Rabbit
is old.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.676

Next look to the Feet, BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.677

if the Claws be short and smooth it is a young one; BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.678

if they be long, and especially if they be rough and ragged, there is
no Doubt but it is an old one.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,27.679

<P_28>

To judge of the Freshness, first smell that it be not musty;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.681

then see that the Flesh be white, clean, and dry, and the Joints stiff;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.682

when growing stale, the Joints become limber, and the Flesh damp and
flabby.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.683

CHAP. VII.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.685

<font> Of Store Dishes, and the Manner of chusing them.  <$$font>
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.686

<$$heading>

Under the Denomination of Store Dishes, come those Articles of the Flesh
or Fish kind, which are kept in the House to be ready on all Occasions.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.688

Some of these can only be bought, because we have no Opportunity of
making them, as Sturgeon and the like; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.689

others may be either bought or made, as Hams, some being foreign and
others English.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.690

We shall hereafter deliver the Method of making such as can be prepared
at home: BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.691

In this Place we are following the Directions given in the last Chapter
for chusing fresh Provisions, with such as are proper for these.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.692

This Section treats only of Marketing.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.693

<heading>

ART. I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.695

<font> Of STURGEON.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.696

<$$heading>

Sturgeon is a vast Fish, sometimes brought fresh to Market, but most
usually pickled; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.698

it is not comparable when fresh to what it is when well pickled,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.699

but we have a great deal that is very poor, and of little Flavour.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.700

To chuse it, see that it be firm and of an even Grain;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.701

to try this, cut it evenly through with a sharp Knife,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.702

if good it cuts tough and firm, BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.703

and seems a little oily: BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.704

if bad, it will break and fall into Pieces, and feel harsh and brittle.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.705

The Colour also is a good Rule for judging; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.706

it should be white, with here and there a blue Vein, and the Gristles
blue; BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.707

such as is brown or yellow is bad.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.708

Finally, a good Way of knowing its Value is by the Skin;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,28.709

when Sturgeon is <P_29> fine this is tender, well-colour'd,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.710

and feels soft; BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.711

but when it is harsh, tough, and dry, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} an ill Sign.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.712

The Smell of Sturgeon also shews its Goodness, BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.713

for when perfectly fine, it has a light pleasant Scent;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.714

and when bad, it is rank, heavy and disagreeable.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.715

There is no Article that requires more Care and Nicety in the Choice
than Sturgeon, BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.716

for when perfectly fine, it is one of the most delicate Fish in the
World, BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.717

but when it is at all defective, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} very poor, and
often quite disagreeable, BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.718

ART. II.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.720

<font> Of PICKLED SALMON.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.721

<$$heading>

Three Things shew the Goodness of Pickled Salmon; First, the Brightness
of the Scales and their sticking fast to the Skin.  Second, the Firmness
of the Flesh; and, third, its fine red Colour.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.723

When the Scales rub off easily, and have a dull Aspect, the Fish has
been bad when pickled; BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.724

and if the Flesh be whitish, crumbly, and break in little rough Flakes,
it has been ill pickled, or in a bad Season.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.725

When Salmon is perfectly fine, the Flesh always is glossy, and as it
were oily, BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.726

and it parts in large regular Flakes, with a delicate and lively Colour.

ART. III.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.729

<font> Of PICKLED HERRINGS.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.730

<$$heading>

The Goodness of a Pickled Herring is known by the Colour of the Bone
and the Texture of the Flesh: BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.732

To try them, let them be cut open to the Back; BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.733

if the Flesh be mellow, soft, and oily, and of a good clear Colour;
and the Bone looks clean, and be either white, or of an agreeable red,
they are good.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,29.734

If the Flesh be dry, and the Bone looks muddy, they are bad.

ART. IV.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.738

<font> Of RED HERRINGS.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.739

<$$heading>

Red Herrings are known to be good by their Colour and Smell;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.741

they should be of a bright, clean, yellowish Hue, and look glossy:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.742

The Smell should be brisk and pleasant, BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.743

and when cut open, the Flesh should easily Part from the Bone.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.744

When they are of a dull Colour they have been ill kept,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.745

and when the Bone will not separate they are never good.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.746

<heading>

ART. V.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.748

<font> Of SALT COD.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.749

<$$heading>

The Cod is known to be good, in some Degree, like the others already
named; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.751

the Flesh is to be mellow, soft, yet firm and oily; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.752

and the Bone is to separate easily.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.753

These are the great Marks of Goodness; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.754

the Flesh should break naturally in large and handsome Flakes,
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.755

and must not look harsh: BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.756

the Back Bone must come away freely, BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.757

and the Colour of the Flesh must be a clean good whitish:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.758

The Smell also assists in judging, BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.759

for when it is rank it is never good.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.760

The larger and sounder the Flakes, always the finer and more delicate
the Fish.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.761

<heading>

ART. VI.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.763

<font> OF LING.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.764

<$$heading>

Ling is to be chosen by its Thickness and Colour, BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.766

that which is thickest about the Head is best BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.767

and the true Colour is a fine pale yellow; BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.768

It should have a soft even Skin, and part from the Bone regularly;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.769

and there should be some Mellowness in the Flesh.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.770

When the Skin is rough, and the whole Fish very hard and dry, it is
not good.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.771

These Rules will serve also for judging of all Kinds of salted Fish
whatsoever.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,30.772

<P_31>

<heading>

ART. VII.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.775

<font> OF HAMS.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.776

<$$heading>

All Hams are so far of the same Kind, that they are made in the same
general Manner, and are liable to the same Defects; so that one Rule
will serve for judging of them all.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.778

The Faults of Hams are to be tainted or rusty; BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.779

this is to be tried by running a Knife into them.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.780

Let a Carving-Knife with a sharp Point be thrust deep into the Middle
of the Ham, on the Inside under the Bone, BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.781

and observe how it comes out; BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.782

first smell to the Hole, BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.783

and if there be an ill Scent at it, the Ham is altogether bad:
BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.784

If the Knife come out clean, and the Flavour on smelling to it be fine,
the Ham is perfect: BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.785

But if it be daubed and smell rank, it is a Proof that the Ham is damp
and tainted within.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.786

Feel also that the Ham be dry, and that the Flesh stick to the Bone.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.787

ART. VIII.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.789

<font> Of BRAWN.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.790

<$$heading>

No Brawn is fine but what has been made from a young Boar;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.792

if he be old it is too hard, BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.793

and if a Barrow or Sow were used instead of a Boar, the Brawn never has
due Firmness.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.794

Examine the Rind, BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.795

if that be firm it is Boar Brawn: BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.796

but if it be too hard the Boar was over aged, BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.797

and it is not so good.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,31.798

A very thick Rind also shews it was an old Boar, and a very soft Rind
that it was Sow or Barrow Brawn, which is always vastly inferior.

SECT. III.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.802

<font> Of Cookery.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.803

<$$heading>

The Mistress of a Family has now seen what Provisions are in Season,
and how she is to chuse them.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.805

We suppose them bought, and good in their Kinds, BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.806

and are to enter upon the main Subject of this Work, the dressing of them.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.807

In all Studies it is the regular Practice to begin with the plainest and
easiest Things, and from these to arise to such as are more difficult
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.808

We shall follow the same Method here, first treating of Roasting and
Boiling, and thence leading the Cook to the most elegant and difficult
Made Dishes.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.809

<heading>

CHAP. VIII.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.811

<font> Of Roasting.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.812

<$$heading>

Cleanliness is the first Article in all Cookery; BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.814

this let the Beginner keep always in her Mind, BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.815

and for the first Preparation toward roasting, let the Spit be clean.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.816

It must be properly cleaned, that is with harmless Things;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.817

some rub their Spits with Brick Dust to get off the Dirt;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.818

and others grease them with Oil to keep them from rusting.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.819

Neither of these is to be allowed, BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.820

for they give a Taste to the Meat.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.821

Let the Spit be cleaned with Sand and Water, nothing else.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.822

When it has been scowered thus, let it be well washed with fair Water,
and dried with a clean Cloth; BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.823

this is, true Cleanliness, BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.824

and is the first Instruction toward roasting.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,32.825

<P_33>

The Fire is to be prepared as well as the Spit; BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.827

and for this two Things are to be regarded, that it be made up in Time,
and that it be proportioned to the Service.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.828

The Chymists talk of their several Degrees of Fire, BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.829

but the Cook has more Need to regard them.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.830

The same Fire that will roast a Sirloin will parch up a lighter Dish.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.831

If the Thing to be roasted be thin and tender, let the Fire be little
and brisk; BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.832

when a large Thing is to be roasted, let there be a sound good Fire
made ready.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.833

Let the Cook see that her Fire be all the while clear at the Bottom;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.834

let her give it a gentle Stirring before she lays the Thing down;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.835

and when it is half done let her remove the Spit and Dripping-pan back,
and rouse it up thoroughly, that it may brisk up for the finishing
with Spirit.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.836

When the Steam from the Meat is drawn toward the Fire, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis}
a Sign it is near done.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.837

This is all that need be said of Roasting in general.
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.838

We shall deliver the particular Rules for separate Things under these
several Articles.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.839

<heading>

ARTICLE I.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.841

<font> Of ROASTING of BEEF.  <$$font> BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.842

<$$heading>

The Fire being proportioned to the Piece to be roasted, the time will be
different in some Measure according to the Season.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.844

The same Piece will be twenty Minutes or half an hour longer roasting
in frosty Weather than in Summer.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.845

In general the Time will be thus proportioned to the Quantity;
BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.846

a Piece of ten Pounds will take an Hour and a Half; one of twenty Pound
Weight three Hours; and so in Proportion: BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.847

But the thicker the Piece is in proportion to its Weight, the longer it
must be down.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.848

This difference is proper to be regarded, BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.849

but it is but little.  BRADLEY2-1760-2,33.850
