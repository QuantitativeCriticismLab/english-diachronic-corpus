<P_104>

<font> Magdalene, BENSON-190X-1,104.2

Ash Wednesday, March <$$font> 8.  BENSON-190X-1,104.3

- A memorable day for me.  BENSON-190X-1,104.4

Cornish writes to say that he deeply <P_105> regrets the turn events
have taken; which means that my letter to the Provost is taken as
final, and that I am released.  For which relief I humbly thank God.
BENSON-190X-1,105.5

Indeed my spirits have gone up with a bound, BENSON-190X-1,105.6

and I feel like a schoolboy.  BENSON-190X-1,105.7

I do not for one instant regret my action, BENSON-190X-1,105.8

and I am quite sure I never shall regret it.  BENSON-190X-1,105.9

What I feared, at the bottom of my heart, was that I should be <font>
cornered; <$$font> that the Governing Body would offer me the post in
such a way that it would have been cowardly and unpatriotic to refuse.
BENSON-190X-1,105.10

I should have done it with fear and trembling, knowing it was not really
my line.  BENSON-190X-1,105.11

{ED:...}

Well, I am honestly very glad indeed; BENSON-190X-1,105.13

I feel like the man in the psalms, whose'{COM:sic} soul had escaped even
as a bird, etc.'BENSON-190X-1,105.14

I feel as if I had recovered my liberty which had been menaced.
BENSON-190X-1,105.15

Providence, I think, has brought me into this anxiety, in order to show
me how dear and precious a thing Liberty is.  BENSON-190X-1,105.16

<font> Libertate me involvo!  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,105.17

Is this a low, selfish, egotistical view?  BENSON-190X-1,105.18

No, because I do honestly mistrust my strength, my patience, my capacity.
BENSON-190X-1,105.19

I think it quite possible that I should have made a fiasco of it.
BENSON-190X-1,105.20

I think that there is a <font> sad <$$font> lack of good candidates,
and that this alone has forced me into prominence; BENSON-190X-1,105.21

but my true life is not there.  BENSON-190X-1,105.22

Of course I feel that Eton is in rather a bad way, intellectually and
morally.  BENSON-190X-1,105.23

I should like to have helped it out.  BENSON-190X-1,105.24

But could I have done it?  BENSON-190X-1,105.25

And after all I gave nineteen years, my best of life, to the place.
BENSON-190X-1,105.26

It is a beautiful bright cool spring morning.  BENSON-190X-1,105.27

Two big pigeons have alighted in the grass just outside my window,
seeking their meat from God.  BENSON-190X-1,105.28

I went to the Commination service at 10 - a very husky affair; three men,
chaplain, Master, Lady Alba, me.  BENSON-190X-1,105.29

The only thing that I carried away, except the sense of the splendour
of the great rhetorical address, was the verse,'thou shalt make me to
understand wisdom secretly. 'BENSON-190X-1,105.30

Now I sit writing, in great thankfulness and contentment.
BENSON-190X-1,105.31

I had not realised what a burden these <P_106> anxieties had been till
they were lifted from my mind, BENSON-190X-1,106.32

and I feel like Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress, when the burden
fell off his back and rolled into a pit that lay in the bottom, <font>
and he saw it no more <$$font>.  BENSON-190X-1,106.33

{ED:...}

I lunched with Donald and Lady Alba alone; BENSON-190X-1,106.35

a pleasant talk about the College, etc. - BENSON-190X-1,106.36

then a walk with Donald to the top of Madingley Hill.
BENSON-190X-1,106.37

Such a sweet day - cold and fresh, but with a real spring wind.
BENSON-190X-1,106.38

{ED:...}

Came down to Coton.  BENSON-190X-1,106.40

We talked out everything, Eton, the Provostship of King's, etc. ,
etc. BENSON-190X-1,106.41

I was glad to find that my contentment only increased, now that
these stately beckoning hands -'Come up hither! '- have withdrawn.
BENSON-190X-1,106.42

I felt no shadow of envy, rather of compassion, for the man who should
be called to Eton.  BENSON-190X-1,106.43

It is a very strange position.  BENSON-190X-1,106.44

{ED:...}

Well, I could, to use an Eton metaphor, <font> run in <$$font> at the
head of a rouge, well pushed by strong men; BENSON-190X-1,106.46

but I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} drag the rouge with me, if they are reluctant
and retrograde.  BENSON-190X-1,106.47

{ED:...}

<font> Magdalene, BENSON-190X-1,106.49

March <$$font> 9.  BENSON-190X-1,106.50

- This morning spent in endless letters, etc. BENSON-190X-1,106.51

It is hopeless work - not a <P_107> line of my proofs.
BENSON-190X-1,107.52

I am again being bombarded about Eton.  BENSON-190X-1,107.53

I am going on quietly with my undergraduates at luncheon;
BENSON-190X-1,107.54

and really I think it rather amuses me.  BENSON-190X-1,107.55

If one could only take things quietly and simply, they would never be
worse than tiresome - never agitating.  BENSON-190X-1,107.56

I am a little bored by always having them; BENSON-190X-1,107.57

but now the instinct of the <font> collector <$$font> comes to my aid,
the desire to <font> complete <$$font> the collection, to tick them
all off!  BENSON-190X-1,107.58

What feeble creatures we are; BENSON-190X-1,107.59

but we ought to use these primeval instincts more.  BENSON-190X-1,107.60

{ED:...}

Then Monty and I walked to Grantchester, BENSON-190X-1,107.62

and <font> daffed <$$font> about many things.  BENSON-190X-1,107.63

Then I contrived to write a passage about religion, which is very careful
and sincere - but too outspoken?  BENSON-190X-1,107.64

Then I dressed BENSON-190X-1,107.65

and went off to Trinity, to the Lodge.  BENSON-190X-1,107.66

What a noble house it is - BENSON-190X-1,107.67

such dignity, amplitude and wealth of pictures and memorials.
BENSON-190X-1,107.68

Mrs. Butler came and talked; BENSON-190X-1,107.69

then came the Master from chapel, very noble to look at, his pale, waxen
face, his kind, tired eyes, his odd beard; in gown and scarf, cassock,
decanal coat and silk stockings.  BENSON-190X-1,107.70

We went into hall by an odd little staircase BENSON-190X-1,107.71

and came out on the dais.  BENSON-190X-1,107.72

He and Aldis Wright read grace, somewhat marred by a crash of falling
trays.  BENSON-190X-1,107.73

{ED:...}

The Master talked suavely, interestingly, continuously.
BENSON-190X-1,107.75

{ED:...}

It is difficult to retain any impression of the stream of his talk.
BENSON-190X-1,107.77

It is remarkable for its range, its knowledge of people, its finish,
its blandness.  BENSON-190X-1,107.78

He has an exaggerated idea of academical success, I think.
BENSON-190X-1,107.79

{ED:...}

Then we stalked out together, very fine; the Master and I leading the way.
BENSON-190X-1,107.81

Another little thing he said amused me.  BENSON-190X-1,107.82

'Do you know,'he said,'Percy Thornton's <font> very <$$font> inferior
book - BENSON-190X-1,107.83

dear Percy Thornton!  - a dear, a very dear and intimate friend of
mine. 'BENSON-190X-1,107.84

In the combination room he spoke very feelingly of his mistakes as a
headmaster, principally of severity - BENSON-190X-1,107.85

his eyes filled with tears.  BENSON-190X-1,107.86

{ED:...}

He is a very beautiful and striking figure, a gracious personality.
BENSON-190X-1,107.88

I felt that I was with a great man, and a man of condescending greatness.
BENSON-190X-1,107.89

<P_108>

Then we went to the Lodge, where he showed us the big judge's bedroom -
on the ground floor, full of interesting pictures of judges.  Then in
the drawing-room a miniature of Byron <paren> <font> not <$$font> very
good <$$paren>.  Then many other pictures: holding a candle aloft with
a tremulous hand with white pointed fingers: BENSON-190X-1,108.91

Mrs. Butler and a shy red-faced girl with a great mop of hair -
BENSON-190X-1,108.92

I never heard her name.  BENSON-190X-1,108.93

Then I went to Henry Jackson; BENSON-190X-1,108.94

a parliament of smokers.  A most dismal business.  BENSON-190X-1,108.95

The great man stood, like a comic mask in a wig, BENSON-190X-1,108.96

and read in a book, which he sometimes showed his neighbour with a
screeching laugh.  BENSON-190X-1,108.97

Ugly and perspiring men, faint with conviviality, stood about.
BENSON-190X-1,108.98

Then I drifted up to Lapsley who paid me compliments -
BENSON-190X-1,108.99

and then went off, after a talk with Cunningham, to Lapsley's rooms,
where I found the old set, Barnes, Laurence, Foakes-Jackson, with
whom I have somehow got included, though they are not at all my sort.
BENSON-190X-1,108.100

How odd these juxtapositions are!  BENSON-190X-1,108.101

Before I knew what I was doing, I was enrolled in a dining-club, to have
free religious discussion.  BENSON-190X-1,108.102

Good God!  - as if that did any good!  BENSON-190X-1,108.103

Then, finding it 12.15, I fled howling, with Foakes-Jackson, whose little
feet, after he left me, I heard pattering down the stony passage by the
Round Church.  BENSON-190X-1,108.104

He said that he dreaded to interview the porter.  BENSON-190X-1,108.105

{ED:...}

I enjoyed the evening very much, BENSON-190X-1,108.107

and ate and drank so moderately that I had a singular lightness of mind.
BENSON-190X-1,108.108

<P_109>

<font> April <$$font> 1.  BENSON-190X-1,109.110

- I plunged early into the fray BENSON-190X-1,109.111

and wrote about thirty letters to all concerned - mostly short notes
just to say what I was doing.  BENSON-190X-1,109.112

The only long letter to Anson.  BENSON-190X-1,109.113

{ED:...}

I must say that, <font> as an omen <$$font>, I had a good encounter.
BENSON-190X-1,109.115

As I came out of my house, having packed off all my letters, I met
J. W. Clark, very red in the face and sleepy-looking,
but with the old nice smile.  BENSON-190X-1,109.116

He said to me,'I suppose I shall soon have to congratulate you on new
honours. 'BENSON-190X-1,109.117

I said,'No, I have just refused to have anything to do with it.
'BENSON-190X-1,109.118

'Then I congratulate you with all my heart,'he said.
BENSON-190X-1,109.119

'You are a man of letters and not an administrator - $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
forget that.  {ED:...}'BENSON-190X-1,109.120

Well, the spirit in which a man takes up a post heavily, nervously,
anxiously, in a spirit of shuddering and sacrifice, hating all the
machinery, etc., is not the proper spirit.  BENSON-190X-1,109.121

I could make a sudden great sacrifice, I believe; BENSON-190X-1,109.122

but the daily self-immolation?  BENSON-190X-1,109.123

I could make it perhaps; BENSON-190X-1,109.124

but all the qualities in me that are worth anything only grow in the
sunshine.  BENSON-190X-1,109.125

I am not one of the people who are effective when they are depressed;
BENSON-190X-1,109.126

I am only really any good when I am blessedly content.
BENSON-190X-1,109.127

I <font> know <$$font> this - BENSON-190X-1,109.128

and this is why I have felt disqualified.  BENSON-190X-1,109.129

If all the staff had been with me, set on the same objects as myself,
ready to make concessions and compromises, and valuing the principle
above the detail; if the Governing Body had <font> summoned <$$font>
me cogently and <P_110> constrainingly, I would have gone, not gladly,
but willingly.  BENSON-190X-1,110.130

But with a G. B. who $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know their own
mind, and with a staff who distrust me, and with a hopeless dislike of
the whole business of administration, how <font> could <$$font> I go?
BENSON-190X-1,110.131

My work is meant to be done in a corner.  BENSON-190X-1,110.132

I have no doubts <font> really <$$font> about this; BENSON-190X-1,110.133

and such as I had seem to melt out of my mind like clouds on a bright
summer morning.  BENSON-190X-1,110.134

Just a little soreness remains - BENSON-190X-1,110.135

'these are the wounds with which I have been wounded in the house of my
friends. 'BENSON-190X-1,110.136

I was anxious to help on the G. B. - BENSON-190X-1,110.137

I was <font> prepared <$$font> to help now; BENSON-190X-1,110.138

but they $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} have me.  BENSON-190X-1,110.139

But I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} want to make myself out <font> both
<$$font> as happy in my refusal <font> and <$$font> pathetic.
BENSON-190X-1,110.140

I <font> am <$$font> happy, unreasonably and absurdly happy.
BENSON-190X-1,110.141

I feel, as I think I said, like a mouse who hears the trap snap just
behind him.  BENSON-190X-1,110.142

The pathos lies further away, the pathos of being somehow, in
spite of certain gifts and powers, a failure; just not effective.
BENSON-190X-1,110.143

It is the secret core of weakness, selfishness, softness in me coming out.
BENSON-190X-1,110.144

But after all, it is He that hath made me.  BENSON-190X-1,110.145

And one fine and beautiful lesson I have lately learnt,
BENSON-190X-1,110.146

and that is the hollowness of personal ambition.  BENSON-190X-1,110.147

I feel as if I should like never to see Eton again, except in dreams.
BENSON-190X-1,110.148

I gave her my money's worth, I think; BENSON-190X-1,110.149

but I could not <font> go up higher.  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,110.150

<font> Dorchester, BENSON-190X-1,110.151

April <$$font> 18.  BENSON-190X-1,110.152

- A mass of letters - BENSON-190X-1,110.153

but we went off early by train.  BENSON-190X-1,110.154

Corfe Castle, sitting on a lonely hill, between two black downs,
with a misty valley behind, looked astonishingly romantic and dim.
BENSON-190X-1,110.155

I liked Poole harbour; BENSON-190X-1,110.156

but there was an old boring talking man in the carriage.
BENSON-190X-1,110.157

{ED:...}

We were at Wimborne by 11.0.  BENSON-190X-1,110.159

The Minster interesting, but rather disappointing.  BENSON-190X-1,110.160

It has a central Norman tower and a western one.  BENSON-190X-1,110.161

But it is a low church, BENSON-190X-1,110.162

<P_111>

and the brown stone with which it is restored is ugly.
BENSON-190X-1,111.164

The town very uninteresting.  BENSON-190X-1,111.165

Found service going on BENSON-190X-1,111.166

and sate it out.  BENSON-190X-1,111.167

Three clergy, and about 30 women!  BENSON-190X-1,111.168

It seemed very false and weak and sentimental.  BENSON-190X-1,111.169

One old parson read aloud in a feeble voice from the choir steps a very
intimate and strained meditation <paren> by Thomas a` Kempis?  <$$paren>
- the sort of thing one might read, in a morbid mood, in one's bedroom,
but not fit to be publicly recited.  BENSON-190X-1,111.170

Then came a hymn; BENSON-190X-1,111.171

the women squeaked feebly, BENSON-190X-1,111.172

but a fine strong bass sang with much feeling - one of the clergy.
BENSON-190X-1,111.173

Then the ante-communion, long Gospel.  BENSON-190X-1,111.174

The whole thing seemed to me dilettante and silly.  BENSON-190X-1,111.175

One felt that the clergy had no business to be sitting there dressed up,
feebly wishing things were otherwise, and bending in prayer, I $dare
$say {TEXT:daresay} quite sincerely.  BENSON-190X-1,111.176

It seemed unmanly, antiquarian.  BENSON-190X-1,111.177

They ought to have been trying to <font> mend <$$font> the World,
if they felt like that, not engaged in sleepy mooning orisons.
BENSON-190X-1,111.178

I felt a hatred of all priestly persons, eating the bread of superstition
and sentiment.  BENSON-190X-1,111.179

I am full of sentiment myself, BENSON-190X-1,111.180

but it ought not to be organised.  BENSON-190X-1,111.181

Then, with two silly women, we were taken all round by an intolerable,
stupid, deaf, vain old clerk, who could not understand one's questions ,
and repeated his lesson.  BENSON-190X-1,111.182

{ED:...}

He said that there was an enlarged photo of himself in the town, in robes.
BENSON-190X-1,111.184

'I am known to thousands of people,'he said.  BENSON-190X-1,111.185

Horrid old wretch!  BENSON-190X-1,111.186

I remembered that it was here that Cornish wooed and won Mrs.
C. BENSON-190X-1,111.187

I liked to remember that.  BENSON-190X-1,111.188

{ED:...}

Then we found in a little village called <font> Anderson <$$font> a simply
enchanting manor-house with a big farmyard attached.  A house of brick,
with gables and oriels, in a wild garden, with a stream running through
big laurels.  BENSON-190X-1,111.190

How I should like to live there!  BENSON-190X-1,111.191

A little church close by.  BENSON-190X-1,111.192

Here we lunched, with a friendly spaniel who shared our sandwiches.
BENSON-190X-1,111.193

A big black dog made demonstrations of displeasure; BENSON-190X-1,111.194

but the peace of the whole place, in this quiet green valley, among
water-meadows, BENSON-190X-1,111.195

the old gables of the manor above the trees!  BENSON-190X-1,111.196

<P_112>

It is to be sold next week.  BENSON-190X-1,112.198

One could live there very happily, I think.  BENSON-190X-1,112.199

But <font> coelum non animum.  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,112.200

{ED:...}

Then we rode on, BENSON-190X-1,112.202

but took different turns BENSON-190X-1,112.203

and missed; BENSON-190X-1,112.204

but rejoined again at a big pine-clad hill-top.  BENSON-190X-1,112.205

Then by Kingston, a house like Addington in a green park;
BENSON-190X-1,112.206

and into Dorchester by the water-meadows, giving a fine view of the town.
BENSON-190X-1,112.207

Another quite delightful day, full of the sweetest impressions of this
beloved earth.  BENSON-190X-1,112.208

A lot more letters.  BENSON-190X-1,112.209

A <font> fine <$$font> letter, full of sense and courage from Herbert
Winton, approving my decision.  BENSON-190X-1,112.210

An interesting letter about books from E. Horner, a moan or two
from the Vice-Provost.  BENSON-190X-1,112.211

A sensible letter from the Master of Peterhouse about Le Bas prize -
BENSON-190X-1,112.212

from Lady St. Germans, President of Magdalen, Willie Strutt,
North S. Hamilton, and others - BENSON-190X-1,112.213

a very interesting batch.  BENSON-190X-1,112.214

I sate down at once BENSON-190X-1,112.215

and wrote fifty, or to be accurate, 25; BENSON-190X-1,112.216

and did not dislike it.  BENSON-190X-1,112.217

Then a peaceful dinner; and letters and diary.  BENSON-190X-1,112.218

<font> Magdalene, BENSON-190X-1,112.219

May <$$font> 5.  BENSON-190X-1,112.220

- I dabbled about with letters all morning.  BENSON-190X-1,112.221

Young paid me a long visit, BENSON-190X-1,112.222

and we talked Eton out; BENSON-190X-1,112.223

but I protest before heaven I will not speak more of it unless I am
obliged.  BENSON-190X-1,112.224

He was very affectionate and blithe.  BENSON-190X-1,112.225

{ED:...}

Then I got a bike out.  BENSON-190X-1,112.227

I had slept indifferently BENSON-190X-1,112.228

and was a little heavy.  BENSON-190X-1,112.229

But the day was simply enchanting - BENSON-190X-1,112.230

a cool north wind, BENSON-190X-1,112.231

the air exquisitely clean and clear.  BENSON-190X-1,112.232

{ED:...}

There is a wold, perhaps sixty feet high, above Swaffham;
BENSON-190X-1,112.234

and Swaffham is just on the edge of the huge fen that stretches to Ely
and Soham, and of which one bit, Wicken, is still <paren> undrained
<$$paren> fen.  BENSON-190X-1,112.235

Well, by the mill up there the view was gigantic and glorious:
BENSON-190X-1,112.236

the long, pure lines of fen and dykes from verge to verge:
BENSON-190X-1,112.237

and on the edge was Ely, in a dim, blue majesty, the sun shining on
the leads as FitzGerald saw it from Newmarket heath sixty years ago!
BENSON-190X-1,112.238

{ED:...}

<P_113>

Then I rode back; BENSON-190X-1,113.241

and by the Devil's Dyke a cuckoo flew beside me, moving his grey,
shimmering wings slowly, and when he perched manoeuvring his ribbed tail.
BENSON-190X-1,113.242

He seemed loath to leave me.  BENSON-190X-1,113.243

I wonder what gift he will bring, false and pretty bird?
BENSON-190X-1,113.244

Do I, like him, want others to hatch my eggs, content with flute-like
notes of pleasure?  BENSON-190X-1,113.245

I wrote a passage on returning: BENSON-190X-1,113.246

dined in hall.  BENSON-190X-1,113.247

{ED:...}

Then H. W. paid me a call: a nice boy, full of anxiety
and good feeling: in the midst of <font> Sturm und Drang <$$font> ,
finding what he calls his"dearest convictions"failing him: very pathetic
in one way, and rather sadly amusing in the other.  His admiration of
and confidence in my literary powers and oracularity of speech rather
embarrassing.  BENSON-190X-1,113.249

We had a long mixed vague talk; BENSON-190X-1,113.250

but I knocked a few nails in, I think.  BENSON-190X-1,113.251

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} help feeling that if this boy finds the art
of expression he may be a good writer; BENSON-190X-1,113.252

at least he seems to me to have ten times the <font> fire <$$font>
I ever possessed.  BENSON-190X-1,113.253

When I realise the intense vehemence and impulsiveness of a boy like
this , his"exultations, agonies,"I feel what a very <font> mild <$$font>
person I was; BENSON-190X-1,113.254

I fell into depression as a young man, BENSON-190X-1,113.255

but even that I bore with angelic meekness; BENSON-190X-1,113.256

I never had the least vestige of a <font> kick <$$font> in me!
BENSON-190X-1,113.257

He discoursed of the dons at Emmanuel, BENSON-190X-1,113.258

and opened my eyes somewhat to the light in which we harmless persons
are regarded.  BENSON-190X-1,113.259

If a don is crusty and silent he is held to be arrogant;
BENSON-190X-1,113.260

if he talks he is a bore.  BENSON-190X-1,113.261

What the devil then <font> is <$$font> he to do?  BENSON-190X-1,113.262

My young friend smiled: BENSON-190X-1,113.263

'Oh, it is in the nature of things,'he said.  BENSON-190X-1,113.264

<font> Monday.  BENSON-190X-1,113.265

May <$$font> 8.  BENSON-190X-1,113.266

- A letter from Edward Lyttelton summoned me to town:
BENSON-190X-1,113.267

I went up, after writing many letters.  BENSON-190X-1,113.268

Found Shipley going up to the Grouse Disease <P_114> Commission.
BENSON-190X-1,114.269

He is amused to find that it is almost entirely in the hands of crack
shots, responsible for the death of many more grouse than even the
disease itself.  BENSON-190X-1,114.270

It is a humorous idea, people trying to stamp out the disease that they
may have the fun of killing the grouse themselves.  BENSON-190X-1,114.271

I drove to the House of Lords.  BENSON-190X-1,114.272

I found Gosse in the library, BENSON-190X-1,114.273

and had a pleasant talk.  BENSON-190X-1,114.274

{ED:...}

Then I went to National Club.  BENSON-190X-1,114.276

Found Edward, brown as a berry, full of tranquillity, good spirits
and confidence.  BENSON-190X-1,114.277

He unfolded to me his schemes.  BENSON-190X-1,114.278

{ED:...}

I thought that this interview might have tried my philosophy and
fortitude; that I might find myself wishing myself in his place, with
a free hand to carry out ideas.  BENSON-190X-1,114.280

But I did not for a single instant.  BENSON-190X-1,114.281

Indeed it was very much the other way.  BENSON-190X-1,114.282

Again and again I said to myself,'Can it be that I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
really wish to have the carrying out of these things, and to hold this
great position? 'BENSON-190X-1,114.283

And not the slightest echo of desire or envy or chagrin came back.
BENSON-190X-1,114.284

That is worth something, I think: worth the long and wearing anxiety of
the candidature.  BENSON-190X-1,114.285

We sate BENSON-190X-1,114.286

and walked up and down in the little garden at the back of the National
Club; BENSON-190X-1,114.287

it was sunny, BENSON-190X-1,114.288

and a fresh wind blew BENSON-190X-1,114.289

and stirred the bushes, which were all green.  BENSON-190X-1,114.290

I liked Edward's candid gaze, the smile which broke out all over his face,
his splendid laugh.  BENSON-190X-1,114.291

He is a mere brown skeleton; but his hands still red and stumpy as of old.
BENSON-190X-1,114.292

I felt an odd mixture of confidence in his strength, and entire mistrust
in his judgment.  BENSON-190X-1,114.293

We finished our talk looking over the little wall above the embankment.
BENSON-190X-1,114.294

Sir A. Bateman passed BENSON-190X-1,114.295

and regarded us with grave surprise.  BENSON-190X-1,114.296

Then Edward biked off to a doctor in Harley Street, about his throat; and
I back to King's Cross; and through a sunny calm evening to Cambridge ,
revolving schemes for Eton, and heartily glad that the burden was not
on my back.  BENSON-190X-1,114.297

{ED:...}

<font> May <$$font> 15.  BENSON-190X-1,114.299

- I seem never to have a moment to write in this book now.
BENSON-190X-1,114.300

I am really as much <paren> or more <$$paren> hustled <P_115> as I was
in old days at Eton.  BENSON-190X-1,115.301

I struggled desperately with letters; BENSON-190X-1,115.302

but had to go off at 11.15 to Pembroke Lodge to see the Bishop of
St. Andrew's by appointment.  BENSON-190X-1,115.303

I found him at the door, pacing about in the sun: looking very tired;
but with just the kind and wistful look of old; the only sign of age a
certain heaviness and slowness.  BENSON-190X-1,115.304

I took him to the Granary BENSON-190X-1,115.305

and he asked me about everyone and everything, looking very long at
E. W. B.'s pictures, especially at the Vanity Fair, which
he liked.  BENSON-190X-1,115.306

Then to Magdalene; where he asked me about myself and my soul, and spoke
very beautifully and simply, like a wise and tired child, half on the
verge of tears, of walking in the Will of God, holding to His hand.
BENSON-190X-1,115.307

Then I took him to the chapel; BENSON-190X-1,115.308

and he knelt down on the step in front of the altar BENSON-190X-1,115.309

and motioned me to kneel by him.  BENSON-190X-1,115.310

He prayed <font> very <$$font> tenderly and wistfully about me and my dear
ones, alive and dead, himself, my work and his.  BENSON-190X-1,115.311

And then he rose BENSON-190X-1,115.312

and with great dignity and simplicity laid his hands on my head
BENSON-190X-1,115.313

and blessed me, with a beautiful form of words of which the music remains
with me, though I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} remember the words themselves -
to be guided, led, helped, comforted.  BENSON-190X-1,115.314

I drew very near to him in that moment; BENSON-190X-1,115.315

and I felt, too, a strange solemnity, a consecration about it, coming
just at the time when I have refused and missed great opportunities;
BENSON-190X-1,115.316

perhaps it was a kind of consecration of my life to Magdalene -
BENSON-190X-1,115.317

who knows?  BENSON-190X-1,115.318

- and yet I do not feel as if Magdalene was to be my home for long.
BENSON-190X-1,115.319

But anyhow, it was just the peaceful patriarchal blessing I wanted
and needed.  BENSON-190X-1,115.320

{ED:...}

And so we walked out in the sun BENSON-190X-1,115.322

and I tried to thank him, BENSON-190X-1,115.323

but could not; BENSON-190X-1,115.324

and he got into the cab BENSON-190X-1,115.325

and drove away with a smile and a wave of the hand, carrying my love
with him.  BENSON-190X-1,115.326

His pale face, the dark circles under the closed eyes, the wistful
, smiling, tearful lips, the black hair, will long live with me.
BENSON-190X-1,115.327

{ED:...}

Of course I am not in line with him in the superficial tones of belief;
BENSON-190X-1,115.329

but I am with him below <P_116> and within, though we $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} call things by the same names.  BENSON-190X-1,116.330

{ED:...}

Then I rode off alone, Monty having thrown me over; BENSON-190X-1,116.332

and again I had one of the most curiously beautiful rides of my life.
BENSON-190X-1,116.333

I got to Milton: BENSON-190X-1,116.334

saw the church, in its green shade, with its elaborately written
monuments, its glorious little window of Jacob, with hands like parsnips
: BENSON-190X-1,116.335

then crossed the line, among the green pastures, so full of great
thorn-thickets: BENSON-190X-1,116.336

and then along the tow-path, riding slowly down the Cam.
BENSON-190X-1,116.337

Such a sweet clear, fresh day.  BENSON-190X-1,116.338

I wound slowly along past Baitsbite and the Waterbeach bridge, into the
heart of the fen.  BENSON-190X-1,116.339

The space below the tow-path full of masses of cow-parsley:
BENSON-190X-1,116.340

the river sapphire blue between the green banks - BENSON-190X-1,116.341

the huge fields running for miles to the right, with the long lines of
dyke and lode; BENSON-190X-1,116.342

far away the blue tower of Ely, the brown roofs of Reach, and the low
wolds of Newmarket.  BENSON-190X-1,116.343

It was simply <font> enchanting!  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,116.344

Such a sense of peace, and happy loneliness, and space and silence.
BENSON-190X-1,116.345

I found a trench full for a mile of the sweet water-violet;
BENSON-190X-1,116.346

pale lilac flowers, with a heavenly scent, on green slim stalks;
leaves like hair: this flower an old friend of mine from Eton days.
BENSON-190X-1,116.347

So I wound on and on, full of peace and content; BENSON-190X-1,116.348

I declare that the <font> absolutely <$$font> flat country, golden with
buttercups, and the blue tree-clumps far away backed by hills, and over
all the vast sky-perspective, is the most beautiful thing <font> of all.
<$$font> BENSON-190X-1,116.349

I got to Upware; BENSON-190X-1,116.350

was ferried across in an old boat; BENSON-190X-1,116.351

spun before the wind to Cambridge.  BENSON-190X-1,116.352

Then Monty came in to tea, very solemn and well-dressed, blue suit and
black tie; BENSON-190X-1,116.353

the <font> Provost!  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,116.354

How strange it all seems, BENSON-190X-1,116.355

and yet how natural; BENSON-190X-1,116.356

that mouth-filling word, with such dim and awful associations.
BENSON-190X-1,116.357

{ED:...}

We talked away, BENSON-190X-1,116.359

and he told me how he was sent for after the first scrutiny and asked
if he would accept.  BENSON-190X-1,116.360

There was a green table set out by the choir door inside, and fellows
in nearly all the stalls.  BENSON-190X-1,116.361

He accepted, BENSON-190X-1,116.362

and they filed out shaking hands.  BENSON-190X-1,116.363

He told me too how the choir-boys asked to see him, and did him a simple
homage in their vestry.  BENSON-190X-1,116.364

Very nice!  BENSON-190X-1,116.365

<P_117>

Then Hall with Jones; BENSON-190X-1,117.367

and a Concert Committee in Sawday's rooms.  BENSON-190X-1,117.368

S. seems resourceful and energetic; BENSON-190X-1,117.369

then a little work; BENSON-190X-1,117.370

but I was tired.  BENSON-190X-1,117.371

<font> Tremans, BENSON-190X-1,117.372

June 2.  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,117.373

- It is very sweet to be here, though a hot soft wind this
morning roars in the pines, and the laburnums are all dishevelled.
BENSON-190X-1,117.374

I wrote, read, talked all morning.  BENSON-190X-1,117.375

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} find courage to attack the Q. V.
bundle.  BENSON-190X-1,117.376

Then walked with Hugh, in sweet woods and lanes; down by the lake,
by Danehurst; and back by the green lane that comes out by Townplace
and Freshfield.  BENSON-190X-1,117.377

He is a strange nature.  BENSON-190X-1,117.378

He is entirely unworldly; BENSON-190X-1,117.379

hates cruelty, rudeness, lack of consideration above everything.
BENSON-190X-1,117.380

Yet he is himself in a way very inconsiderate.  BENSON-190X-1,117.381

Table and ledge, all over this house, are heaped with books he has torn
out of shelves and thrown down.  BENSON-190X-1,117.382

The litter in the little smoking-room is fearful.  BENSON-190X-1,117.383

Last night he would not leave dear Beth in peace till she had found him
a box, BENSON-190X-1,117.384

and she trotted about far more than was good for her.
BENSON-190X-1,117.385

He has a great charm; though I often feel that in my absence he thinks
little of me.  BENSON-190X-1,117.386

He has, indeed, all the charm, the <font> bonhomie <$$font>
, the attractiveness, the hardness of the artistic nature.
BENSON-190X-1,117.387

I wrote away about Pater and Cuckoos.  BENSON-190X-1,117.388

Then found M. at dinner, looking well and strong.
BENSON-190X-1,117.389

We rather lapsed into vague scrappiness about the Mission, etc.
BENSON-190X-1,117.390

Then I read a little paper which aroused some discussion.
BENSON-190X-1,117.391

Then prayers, cutting short the thread, with a hymn which I can only call
damnable; bearing the same relation to poetry and music that onions and
toasted cheese do to claret and peaches; strong, coarsely flavoured ,
ugly, untrue <font> nonsense.  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,117.392

It is odd to me that the dear ladies who are so refinedly critical in
<P_118> other regions $do $n't {TEXT:don't} see that this is vulgar.
BENSON-190X-1,118.393

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} myself believe that vulgarity is a sin at all,
BENSON-190X-1,118.394

but I happen to dislike it; BENSON-190X-1,118.395

and in this short life, that is enough.  BENSON-190X-1,118.396

{ED:...}

<font> Saturday, June <$$font> 3.  BENSON-190X-1,118.398

- They are celebrating the Fourth of June at Eton, BENSON-190X-1,118.399

and thank God I am not there in any capacity whatever.
BENSON-190X-1,118.400

I wrote letters all the morning.  BENSON-190X-1,118.401

{ED:...}

Then I took a bicycle BENSON-190X-1,118.403

and rode by Chailey and Plumpton, on to Wivelsfield, and back by
Hayward's Heath.  BENSON-190X-1,118.404

It was a perfect day; BENSON-190X-1,118.405

and this great undulating plain, full of oak-woods, with the pure
austere line of the downs, so dark and dusky, coming out at every turn
over the bright and fretted green of the uncrumpling oak leaves, was a
perpetual joy.  BENSON-190X-1,118.406

The view from North Common is one of the most beautiful in England,
I think.  BENSON-190X-1,118.407

I pondered many things, not unhappily, though my thoughts had a melancholy
tinge to-day.  BENSON-190X-1,118.408

Life races past so swiftly; BENSON-190X-1,118.409

there is so much to see, to enjoy, to feel; such endless beauty,
so many dear and interesting relations with others to experience.
BENSON-190X-1,118.410

I feel like a man at a huge banquet, lamenting his slender appetite.
BENSON-190X-1,118.411

The white heads of daisies, floating on the top of deep meadow grass,
affected me tyrannously.  BENSON-190X-1,118.412

I felt as if I could have ridden for ever in that quiet joy, feasting
my eyes and heart on quiet beauty and grace, until the evening.
BENSON-190X-1,118.413

Yes, and what then?  BENSON-190X-1,118.414

Since then I have written a little at Pater, and my book, really finishing
the latter, I think.  BENSON-190X-1,118.415

The proofs arrive.  BENSON-190X-1,118.416

Every now and then a gun is fired in a field near; BENSON-190X-1,118.417

a fierce twitter of sparrows and starlings rises in the ivy,
BENSON-190X-1,118.418

and the peacock blows his harsh trumpet.  BENSON-190X-1,118.419

{ED:...}

The evening falls slowly; BENSON-190X-1,118.421

a warm air steals in.  BENSON-190X-1,118.422

The laburnums hang heavily, BENSON-190X-1,118.423

and the birds sing faintly.  BENSON-190X-1,118.424

All is breathlessly still.  BENSON-190X-1,118.425

Dear old Beth comes trotting up with a rose which she has tied for me.
BENSON-190X-1,118.426

Well, I have had another very happy day, BENSON-190X-1,118.427

and am grateful.  BENSON-190X-1,118.428

<P_119>

<font> The Old Granary, BENSON-190X-1,119.430

June <$$font> 12.  BENSON-190X-1,119.431

- Having next to no letters and no paper I began work immediately after
breakfast on the Q. V. letters, BENSON-190X-1,119.432

and did a great batch.  BENSON-190X-1,119.433

But it is too hot for comfort.  BENSON-190X-1,119.434

{ED:...}

After lunch I went off in a calm and leisurely spirit on a bicycle.
BENSON-190X-1,119.436

It was a peculiar pleasure to get out of Cambridge, which was crammed
with Whit-Monday folk, as well as the bevies of sisters and friends,
led about by excited undergraduates.  BENSON-190X-1,119.437

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} at all wish to depreciate this background.
BENSON-190X-1,119.438

It is rather pleasant when one is living independent and secure, to feel
this gaiety going on, which would be unendurable if one had to take part
in it.  BENSON-190X-1,119.439

I rather like the perpetual swish of waves beneath my window, the
creaking of oars, the cheerful chatter of irresponsible persons;
BENSON-190X-1,119.440

it sets the slow melody of my own thoughts to a cheerful descant.
BENSON-190X-1,119.441

{ED:...}

I saw a goldfinch, and a large finch unknown to me, I imagine a hawfinch.
BENSON-190X-1,119.443

Then on by Babraham, over the Gogs, with a splendid view, richly coloured
and tranquil; BENSON-190X-1,119.444

and so home, BENSON-190X-1,119.445

a good ride and very happy.  BENSON-190X-1,119.446

Tea.  BENSON-190X-1,119.447

Then wrote a fantasy for my <font> House of Neville <$$font> book.
BENSON-190X-1,119.448

Then O. B. came to dinner.  BENSON-190X-1,119.449

This was a severe trial.  BENSON-190X-1,119.450

But I got an odd, pathetic interest out of it.  BENSON-190X-1,119.451

He talked for two hours without a moment's cessation of his influence,
the ambitions he had had, his services to education, his services
to King's, the malignity and jealousy of everyone in the world.
BENSON-190X-1,119.452

He said that his habitual feeling here was that of a whipped hound
, that everyone was in a conspiracy to belittle and insult him.
BENSON-190X-1,119.453

And yet it was all full of fine flashes of insight, of purpose, of wisdom.
BENSON-190X-1,119.454

{ED:...}

He indulged in many acute characterisations of people.
BENSON-190X-1,119.456

He described his farewell to Uncle Henry, which he said was very
affecting.  BENSON-190X-1,119.457

It <P_120> appears that O. B. talked, according to his
own confession, entirely about himself, in the same vein; his ambitions,
his services, his disappointments.  BENSON-190X-1,120.458

It never enters the man's head that he is in the <font> least <$$font>
to blame; BENSON-190X-1,120.459

I $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} say it makes me miserable, BENSON-190X-1,120.460

for there is a lurid interest about it all; BENSON-190X-1,120.461

but it is really the saddest thing; because the man is a genius, and
because he <font> has <$$font> done a great work, in his odd, selfish
way; BENSON-190X-1,120.462

but he is all coated and scaled with egotism, and covered with prickles.
BENSON-190X-1,120.463

He had brought a lot of documents with him, BENSON-190X-1,120.464

and the evening ended by his reading to me in his fat utterance the
testimonials he had received when he stood for a Professorship at Glasgow.
BENSON-190X-1,120.465

He never said a word about anyone except to malign them;
BENSON-190X-1,120.466

he never asked for an opinion; BENSON-190X-1,120.467

he did not attend to anything that I said, BENSON-190X-1,120.468

and interrupted me again and again.  BENSON-190X-1,120.469

The only remarks which he listened to were those that were couched in
flattering terms.  BENSON-190X-1,120.470

The effect is indescribable.  BENSON-190X-1,120.471

I felt, when he waddled off, as if I had been turned over and over in
somewhat ill-smelling waves; BENSON-190X-1,120.472

and yet I $could $n't {TEXT:couldn't} help realising his force, his
brilliancy and his genius.  BENSON-190X-1,120.473

He set me thinking somehow; BENSON-190X-1,120.474

and gave one an inspiration to try and keep up an intellectual standard.
BENSON-190X-1,120.475

He made one ill jest about - and his wife, which is really incomparably
humorous, but rather too broad to reproduce.  BENSON-190X-1,120.476

<font> Je m'y perds!  <$$font> BENSON-190X-1,120.477

The strangeness of the creation of such a man, so fine, so gross, so
public-spirited, so mean, so intellectual, so dull, so great, so little,
is a perfect mystery.  BENSON-190X-1,120.478

The tares and the wheat grow together in rich luxuriance, inextricably
intertwined.  BENSON-190X-1,120.479

His ruling passion seemed to be to make King's a great college,
and to make all the money and credit out of it that he could.
BENSON-190X-1,120.480

He has done a great work and covered himself with discredit, and deserved
discredit.  BENSON-190X-1,120.481

He has created a school here, BENSON-190X-1,120.482

and he is detested.  BENSON-190X-1,120.483

He has fought the battle of intellectual things, BENSON-190X-1,120.484

and he is a holy terror.  BENSON-190X-1,120.485

He is a genius and a bore, a man of light and darkness; Hyperion and a
satyr, Jekyll and Hyde.  BENSON-190X-1,120.486

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} defend him BENSON-190X-1,120.487

and yet I admire him; BENSON-190X-1,120.488

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} respect him BENSON-190X-1,120.489

and yet I like him; BENSON-190X-1,120.490

I pity him with <P_121> all my heart, BENSON-190X-1,121.491

and yet the one thing he does not desire is pity.  BENSON-190X-1,121.492

He is half baker and half devil; BENSON-190X-1,121.493

and the odd thing is that he is not now one, now another, but both
at once.  BENSON-190X-1,121.494

There is no theory of God which will explain the existence of a man like
O. B. BENSON-190X-1,121.495

And the result of my talk has been that the mystery of the Universe
presses fiercely on my mind.  BENSON-190X-1,121.496

<font> Skelwithfold, BENSON-190X-1,121.497

July <$$font> 20.  BENSON-190X-1,121.498

- I wrote a long letter to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, congratulating him
on his accession, and bidding him rule well.  BENSON-190X-1,121.499

Odd to find oneself advising a little Monarch how to rule.
BENSON-190X-1,121.500

I do wish him well with all my heart.  BENSON-190X-1,121.501

{ED:...}

A cloudy morning, rather close and grey.  BENSON-190X-1,121.503

{ED:...}

The afternoon was <font> most <$$font> interesting.  BENSON-190X-1,121.505

We drove through Ambleside, BENSON-190X-1,121.506

and I recognised the house where the pert girl was in 1870 -
BENSON-190X-1,121.507

it was just below Belle Vue, BENSON-190X-1,121.508

and belonged to a cousin of Wordsworth's - BENSON-190X-1,121.509

now a training college.  BENSON-190X-1,121.510

We went to Fox Howe.  BENSON-190X-1,121.511

This place was built and planted by Arnold, just sixty years ago;
BENSON-190X-1,121.512

yet it has all the look of an old, settled, peaceful place.
BENSON-190X-1,121.513

It is odd that the time required is <font> just <$$font> too long for
a man to enjoy it himself.  BENSON-190X-1,121.514

If he built at forty, and few people can do it before, he would <font>
begin <$$font> to have it right at eighty.  BENSON-190X-1,121.515

The house is bigger and more stately than I had thought; in the
semi-ecclesiastical taste of the'forties.  BENSON-190X-1,121.516

The garden beautiful - BENSON-190X-1,121.517

it is embowered in tall trees and lawns - one with the oddest curved
flower-bed I have ever seen; BENSON-190X-1,121.518

all this planned by Wordsworth.  BENSON-190X-1,121.519

From the windows you see green water-meadows, leafy hillsides, may-trees ,
and great green mountains; BENSON-190X-1,121.520

but it is rather a hothouse; BENSON-190X-1,121.521

and the ceaseless cries of trippers in their char-a`-bancs on <P_122>
the road hard by are horrible.  BENSON-190X-1,122.522

Miss Arnold received us - a dear old lady - BENSON-190X-1,122.523

rich complexion, big smiling mouth, full of teeth, long nose, rippled
hair, slight cast of eye; but with such a sweet, courteous manner, so
that one hangs on the simplest words that come from her lips as seeming
to have a flavour and a quality denied to others.  BENSON-190X-1,122.524

We talked of her relations and mine - BENSON-190X-1,122.525

I wish I had a beautiful, dignified, courteous manner!
BENSON-190X-1,122.526

It comes from those qualities in the mind, joined with a certain timbre
of voice and distinctness of utterance.  BENSON-190X-1,122.527

{ED:...}

We walked about the garden a little; BENSON-190X-1,122.529

and then drove away; BENSON-190X-1,122.530

I valued this sight of an interesting house and a gracious lady very
deeply.  BENSON-190X-1,122.531

Then we drove on to Rydal Mount; BENSON-190X-1,122.532

and were fortunate again - BENSON-190X-1,122.533

Mrs. Fisher-Wordsworth at home; BENSON-190X-1,122.534

we passed by the way houses inhabited by all sorts of familiar names,
Quillinan, Rawnsley, Wordsworth.  BENSON-190X-1,122.535

Rydal Mount is invisible from the lower road.  BENSON-190X-1,122.536

You walk up past the church.  BENSON-190X-1,122.537

It is a very tiny place - like a farmhouse - BENSON-190X-1,122.538

but the gardens with trees and terraces, and the odd Mount of
Meeting, which gives its name to the place, are all impressive.
BENSON-190X-1,122.539

I remembered seeing it in'70 - the slate steps leading up to the front
of the house, through rhododendrons, BENSON-190X-1,122.540

recalled it.  BENSON-190X-1,122.541

Papa gave me a Wordsworth, bought at Lincoln Station, in honour of
the visit.  BENSON-190X-1,122.542

The rooms tiny - and a <font> fearful <$$font> smell of dry-rot - but
deeply moving and interesting.  BENSON-190X-1,122.543

Portraits and busts everywhere - such as Haydon's.  BENSON-190X-1,122.544

But it must have looked very different in the Poet's time - much newer,
much more <font> raw; <$$font> he was making the garden then, and adding
to the house - and of course <font> much <$$font> simpler in furniture,
etc. BENSON-190X-1,122.545

The garden struck me greatly - the view of Windermere, the beautiful fall
of the ground, the trees, the almost tropical luxuriance of everything.
BENSON-190X-1,122.546

I felt a good deal of emotion about the whole thing - much more than at
Fox Howe.  BENSON-190X-1,122.547

The stiff, self-absorbed, commonplace-looking man <paren> Wordsworth
, I mean <$$paren> was, after all, a high priest of mysteries -
BENSON-190X-1,122.548

and the house stands for much high and beautiful <font> joy.  <$$font>
BENSON-190X-1,122.549

He lived here thirty-five years.  BENSON-190X-1,122.550

<P_123>

They are terribly harried by trippers.  BENSON-190X-1,123.552

But Mrs. F. W., rather a pretty woman, showed
us everything, the chests, the little old parlour, etc., with
great zest.  BENSON-190X-1,123.553

I wish I could copy the dignity of Wordsworth, in refusing to do <font>
anything <$$font> but what he loved.  BENSON-190X-1,123.554

I will aim at that.  BENSON-190X-1,123.555

The lines of Milton kept running in my head as we walked about, with a
deep thrill: BENSON-190X-1,123.556

On this mount he appeared; BENSON-190X-1,123.557

under this tree Stood visible; BENSON-190X-1,123.558

among these pines his voice I heard; BENSON-190X-1,123.559

here with him at this fountain talked.  BENSON-190X-1,123.560

P. L., xi, 320.  BENSON-190X-1,123.561

The two places together filled me with interest.  BENSON-190X-1,123.562

School-mastering and poetry!  BENSON-190X-1,123.563

To see the abodes of two of the prophets, masters in these two arts, both
of which I have practised, and in both of which I have meekly and humbly
failed, was a kind of humiliating inspiration.  BENSON-190X-1,123.564

After this I decided to walk over the Fell.  BENSON-190X-1,123.565

Not a breath stirring, BENSON-190X-1,123.566

and a close, unutterable heat.  BENSON-190X-1,123.567

I went slowly up among the ferns, dripping, buzzed about by flies;
but with fine backward glances at Nab Scar and the dark lake below.
BENSON-190X-1,123.568

As I rose, the great mountains rose to look at me, behind the nearer
hills.  BENSON-190X-1,123.569

I know nothing, BENSON-190X-1,123.575

but it is of no use bemoaning it; BENSON-190X-1,123.577

I remember what interests me.  BENSON-190X-1,123.578

I expect I read as many books as he did!  BENSON-190X-1,123.579

I lunched off cold fragments - very nice.  BENSON-190X-1,124.590

Took a train to Hayward's Heath, and then by Burgess Hill right out to

{ED:...}

I found at last such a pretty out-of-the-world place, Twineham, with
a little brick Jacobean church, at the end of a lane - small, dark and
comfortable; BENSON-190X-1,124.593

an old Italian picture <paren> a bad copy, I expect <$$paren>, of a holy
family, which might have some appeal to imagination, poked away over the
chancel arch, without misgivings, in order to make room for Mr.
Kempe at his worst.  BENSON-190X-1,124.594

A sly, ferret-faced angel, incredibly involved in raiment, as though
the celestial temperature were arctic, making his announcement to
a Virgin, who looks as if she were being photographed, very demure.
BENSON-190X-1,124.595

The colours inoffensive, BENSON-190X-1,124.596

but a poor work of art.  BENSON-190X-1,124.597

From the pretty little lonely churchyard, over a wheatfield, the
outline of the down rose and fell, like a green and shadowy wave.
BENSON-190X-1,124.598

A school feast at the vicarage.  BENSON-190X-1,124.599

I read epitaphs, BENSON-190X-1,124.600

and sate long on the broad, low slab of a grave, wondering who and what
my host, that lay below, had been.  BENSON-190X-1,124.601

It was very sweet in that little secluded churchyard,
BENSON-190X-1,124.602

and for once I had no sense of hurry.  BENSON-190X-1,124.603

Twineham Place, an old farm-house, held up its timbered gables and rusty
chimneys very pleasantly over a grove of oaks.  BENSON-190X-1,124.604

which is rich and dim, like a cathedral, full of villainous, yet joyful,
glass.  BENSON-190X-1,124.612

It has an incomparable view from the churchyard; BENSON-190X-1,124.613

yet I suppose that man $can $n't {TEXT:can't} live on views alone.
BENSON-190X-1,124.614

I spent rather a feeble morning; BENSON-190X-1,124.615

a hot, damp southwest wind was blowing, BENSON-190X-1,124.616

and the mind was unstrung.  BENSON-190X-1,124.617

I <P_125> went out bicycling, BENSON-190X-1,125.618

and worked down against the wind to Burgess Hill, returning to
Wivelsfield, BENSON-190X-1,125.619

and I saw many beautiful vignettes; a deserted byre, with a big
stone-tiled barn, doors open, BENSON-190X-1,125.620

and a water-wagtail, with head on one side, looked curiously in to the
raftered dark; BENSON-190X-1,125.621

a little timbered, ancient house, the front walls all scored with pale
half-circles, where the roses swung to and fro; BENSON-190X-1,125.622

a deep, silent lane, overhung with close hazels, up which I went in
gratified silence.  BENSON-190X-1,125.623

We were going to have had a talk, when J. W. Clark came in

Then back BENSON-190X-1,126.665

and wrote.  BENSON-190X-1,126.666

I had noticed in King's in the morning a fine-looking boy, evidently a

lo and behold the same came to call on me, BENSON-190X-1,126.668

and turns out to be Mallory, from Winchester, one of our new exhibitioners
at Magdalene.  BENSON-190X-1,126.669

He sate some time; BENSON-190X-1,126.670

and a simpler, more ingenuous, more unaffected, more genuinely interested

He seemed full of admiration for all good things, and yet with no touch

I wrote feverishly after that - BENSON-190X-1,127.675

or gather in groups.  BENSON-190X-1,128.706

I got stuck on a sofa with Sedgwick, BENSON-190X-1,128.707

and enjoyed the talk of this positive, brusque, pleasant scientist,
interlarded with oaths.  BENSON-190X-1,128.708

He has a curious admiration for literature, BENSON-190X-1,128.709

and talked books hard - with a half-regretful air, as a man
might talk about vintages, without being able to tell them apart.
BENSON-190X-1,128.710

I grew weary, not of him, but of myself.  BENSON-190X-1,128.711

I did not want to sit in one place, boring one man to death;
BENSON-190X-1,128.712

why $can $n't {TEXT:can't} there be more ease and simplicity about
these things?  BENSON-190X-1,128.713

Meanwhile a group scintillated at the fire, BENSON-190X-1,128.714

talked BENSON-190X-1,128.715

and laughed shrilly.  BENSON-190X-1,128.716

How well I know that kind of false convivial excitement, which is not
even pleasant.  BENSON-190X-1,128.717

At midnight the V.C.  rose, BENSON-190X-1,128.718

and crept downstairs, BENSON-190X-1,128.719

and so we parted.  BENSON-190X-1,128.720

Let me note that the funny little yellow coach or sedan, which draws
a lady from the great gate to the Master's Lodge, was standing out,
there being a party at the Lodge.  BENSON-190X-1,128.721

No one knows where it is kept.  BENSON-190X-1,128.722

It must be quite an ancient relic.  BENSON-190X-1,128.723

Finally to bed late, BENSON-190X-1,128.724

and dreamt horrible and elaborate dreams.  BENSON-190X-1,128.725

So much for conviviality - an overrated thing.  BENSON-190X-1,128.726

{ED:...}

<font> Sunday, December <$$font> 10.  BENSON-190X-1,128.728

- I was much grieved last night to hear of Jebb's death.
BENSON-190X-1,128.729

He had a great attraction for me - both the thought of his delicate and
beautiful mind, as well as of the secluded scholarly character of the man.
BENSON-190X-1,128.730

Of late, it seemed as if I had <P_129> come nearer to him.
BENSON-190X-1,129.731

He was always very cordial when we met.  BENSON-190X-1,129.732

The last time I saw him was at the Board of Education, when he sate
opposite me, and slept all the afternoon - he was obviously unwell.
BENSON-190X-1,129.733

His wide blue eye, his veined and almost scarred face, thin whiskers ,
much brushed up hair and great stoop, gave him an odd distinguished look -
half common, half refined.  BENSON-190X-1,129.734

His sonorous, clear, poetical, resonant voice, always very beautiful.
BENSON-190X-1,129.735

It was strange to see him <font> oar <$$font> himself along with his hand,
as with a paddle, beating the air.  BENSON-190X-1,129.736

He used to speak warmly of my English style.  BENSON-190X-1,129.737

I felt somehow that he liked me.  BENSON-190X-1,129.738

{ED:...}

Gosse in good spirits - BENSON-190X-1,129.740

we went to King's Chapel together BENSON-190X-1,129.741

and sate in the antechapel.  BENSON-190X-1,129.742

The service very sweet: <font> BENSON-190X-1,129.743

Hark!  a thrilling, <$$font> etc., made me want to be up and doing,
though not necessarily on clerical lines.  BENSON-190X-1,129.744

Then I talked to W. D., etc., in the court;
BENSON-190X-1,129.745

wrote; BENSON-190X-1,129.746

lunched; BENSON-190X-1,129.747

walked with Gosse round Coton.  BENSON-190X-1,129.748

A sunset of quite extraordinary beauty - the leafless trees, seen over
bare fields, the hamlet roofs, the world beyond, and the sun sinking
orange into smoky wisps of cloud, which he seemed to draw with him.
BENSON-190X-1,129.749

We watched the crimson orb slip behind the hill.  BENSON-190X-1,129.750

Horace Darwin and his daughter watched it too.  BENSON-190X-1,129.751

We talked of many things.  BENSON-190X-1,129.752

{ED:...}

He told me of a little autobiographical book he meant to write - his
early days with his calvinistic father - the contest of paganism with
rigid faith.  BENSON-190X-1,129.754

{ED:...}

He seemed glad to be here, and to feel better after his quiet day.
BENSON-190X-1,129.756

<font> The Old Granary, BENSON-190X-1,129.757

December <$$font> 16.  BENSON-190X-1,129.758

- Such a beautiful day of calm, golden, chilly sun; BENSON-190X-1,129.759

everything sparkling and subdued, too.  BENSON-190X-1,129.760

Letters and business in much mass all morning.  BENSON-190X-1,129.761

A welcome letter from Esher to say that the King will now be
able to look at proofs, etc., now that the crisis is over.
BENSON-190X-1,129.762

A nice letter from the new Postmaster-General.  BENSON-190X-1,129.763

{ED:...}

In the afternoon Monty came for me just as I was going to bike - so we
walked together by Coe Fen, the <P_130> avenue, and out to Cherry Hinton.
BENSON-190X-1,130.765

We went into the church, BENSON-190X-1,130.766

and looked at the delightful monument to a young Serocold, with the
extract from Lord Hood's despatch, which begins,'I have to regret,
and which I do most sincerely,'etc. BENSON-190X-1,130.767

We also admired the beautiful Early English chancel, so light and
clean and ascetic in air, with its slender shafts and rich mouldings.
BENSON-190X-1,130.768

Monty, this great academical dignitary, in loose grey suit, white
Homburg hat, small, ill-tied shoes, shuffling along merrily, pleased me.
BENSON-190X-1,130.769

We rambled along inconsequently in talk as we are wont to do - always
quite delightful.  BENSON-190X-1,130.770

He is one of the few people to whom I can and do say exactly what I
think and as I think it.  BENSON-190X-1,130.771

He never misunderstands, BENSON-190X-1,130.772

is always amused, always appreciative.  BENSON-190X-1,130.773

And yet I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} recollect what we talked about.
BENSON-190X-1,130.774

We came back by an abandoned road by the huge cement works, which
contrived to look sombre and solemn in the gathering dusk, with their
huge chimneys belching smoke, their powdered roofs, their odd retorts
and towers: the lights beginning to be lighted within, and giant
shapes of moving beams and rods to move shadowily before the windows.
BENSON-190X-1,130.775

It is all very well to think these huge places unromantic and ugly,
BENSON-190X-1,130.776

but what would a mediaeval knight have said if he had seen one at the
end of a forest avenue?  BENSON-190X-1,130.777

We came back in the dark by a long lighted road, the shops wearing a
Christmas air.  BENSON-190X-1,130.778

Then by Parker's Piece, the R. C. Cathedral standing up very
beautiful over dark houses against a sunset sky.  BENSON-190X-1,130.779

Then to a book-shop where he bought books - BENSON-190X-1,130.780

and so back to tea.  BENSON-190X-1,130.781

Then I worked hard, BENSON-190X-1,130.782

a review of <font> In Memoriam <$$font> with Tennyson's own notes,
a series of gruff growls and snorts of disdain - and other pieces.
BENSON-190X-1,130.783

{ED:...}

Then dined alone; afterwards reading and writing till late.
BENSON-190X-1,130.785

I like these solitary evenings now, BENSON-190X-1,130.786

and need no companion.  BENSON-190X-1,130.787

I am reading the life of William Morris again.  BENSON-190X-1,130.788

The frank and beautiful youth, so unconscious, so vivid, of these
interesting creatures - he, Burne-Jones, Dixon, C. Price and the
rest - pleases me by its fragrance and affection.  BENSON-190X-1,130.789

And I regard it, too, as one of the best written biographies of the
century, <P_131> if not of all English biographies.  BENSON-190X-1,131.790

It is so perfectly balanced and proportioned - so just, so beautiful.
BENSON-190X-1,131.791

But it makes one sad, too, to think that all these lives have faded
into dust!  BENSON-190X-1,131.792

If I could but get hold of a belief that would bring the death of
sweet things into line with hope, what a difference would be there!
BENSON-190X-1,131.793

I slept very ill, BENSON-190X-1,131.794

and read W. M. in the quiet hours between 3.0 and 5.0,
the weir rushing outside, the night still and cold.  BENSON-190X-1,131.795

<font> Magdalene, BENSON-190X-1,135.800

February <$$font> 8, 1906.  BENSON-190X-1,135.801

- After Hall I looked over the Prize Poems for the Chancellor's English
Medal - ten in all.  BENSON-190X-1,135.802

Two were <font> good <$$font>, one in blank verse the best, I think -
but one in pretty triplets, decidedly poetical.  BENSON-190X-1,135.803

Another had some fine stanzas: BENSON-190X-1,135.804

'The cheerless-whirling wheel'struck me as a Tennysonian touch of
high merit.  BENSON-190X-1,135.805

The rest worthless.  BENSON-190X-1,135.806

<font> Friday, February <$$font> 9.  BENSON-190X-1,135.807

- A disgusting morning of letters - BENSON-190X-1,135.808

I wrote about 30.  BENSON-190X-1,135.809

{ED:...}

Then I had a great pleasure - BENSON-190X-1,135.811

it was bitterly cold, BENSON-190X-1,135.812

but I bicycled alone, on frozen roads, out to Boxworth by Huntingdon Road.
BENSON-190X-1,135.813

I had not realised how <font> thirsty <$$font> I was becoming for the
country.  BENSON-190X-1,135.814

Never did a sun-baked man drain a cup of well-water more greedily than I
took in the impression of the fields wrinkled with cold, the low hills,
the black pinfold-lighted tower of Lolworth, the partridges calling in
the grass, the broad misty fen.  BENSON-190X-1,135.815

I came back the same way; and then by invitation to tea with the
charming Mallory, in his rooms in the corner of the court, over the road.
BENSON-190X-1,135.816

We talked like old friends, mostly of mountaineering,
BENSON-190X-1,135.817

and I was pleased at my entertainment.  BENSON-190X-1,135.818

Then worked hard at various things.  BENSON-190X-1,135.819

To Hall, which was cheerful and pleasant; BENSON-190X-1,135.820

and then I had to rush to St. John's to read a paper before the
Theological Society.  BENSON-190X-1,135.821

It met in rooms in the top of the furthermost corner of the New Court.
BENSON-190X-1,135.822

I had never been here {COM:sic} before.  BENSON-190X-1,135.823

The stone corridors and iron-railed staircases are <font> horrible
<$$font> - BENSON-190X-1,135.824

but the rooms have a certain dignity and style.  BENSON-190X-1,135.825

In a long room, with green Gothic doorways, quite small, I found more
men assembled than I could have believed <P_136> could have got in -
forty, I should think.  BENSON-190X-1,136.826

We began with prayer, very solemn.  BENSON-190X-1,136.827

Then I read my elaborate and inappropriate paper on Personality
in Art, sitting in a low chair in the corner with a glaring lamp.
BENSON-190X-1,136.828

Then a few questions were asked, BENSON-190X-1,136.829

and I discoursed fluently but not well about Ruskin, Carlyle, etc.,
etc. BENSON-190X-1,136.830

Then it was brought to an end, BENSON-190X-1,136.831

coffee came in, BENSON-190X-1,136.832

and a group of very nice boys came round BENSON-190X-1,136.833

and asked me all sorts of questions.  BENSON-190X-1,136.834

I only wish I did not feel so big and stupid, and so little like the
celebrity they seem to regard me as.  BENSON-190X-1,136.835

One, whose questions had struck me, with a very odd crop of black tangled
hair, strangely parted, was most attentive; BENSON-190X-1,136.836

and finally walked with me to the gate, discoursing softly.
BENSON-190X-1,136.837

The great tower looked very fine in the moonlight, as we passed through
the great splendid courts.  BENSON-190X-1,136.838

{ED:...}

I like my young friend - BENSON-190X-1,136.840

asked him to lunch; BENSON-190X-1,136.841

came back, BENSON-190X-1,136.842

smoked, BENSON-190X-1,136.843

worked fitfully at trifles, BENSON-190X-1,136.844

and eventually to bed, though dreading my cold room; BENSON-190X-1,136.845

and dreamed horribly - a confused dream of being back at Eton as a boy,
of swinging by a rope from the ceiling of a great hall, my aim being to
swing myself into a balcony at the side.  BENSON-190X-1,136.846

{ED:...}

I forgot to say that on Thursday afternoon, about 2.0, one of the
strangest storms I have ever seen came on.  BENSON-190X-1,136.848

The air became dim and black - BENSON-190X-1,136.849

there were furious flashes of a sort of purple lightning, heavy peals
of thunder, and then a furious shower of hail, so that the garden was
whitened with it.  BENSON-190X-1,136.850

They have not only felled the pretty alder, but pruned the plane, so that
the houses of the Chesterton Road look in as by a window into the garden.
BENSON-190X-1,136.851

It is rather pathetic that my original offer of trees to the College
was just to fill this ugly increasing gap; BENSON-190X-1,136.852

and now, as long as I hold my fellowship, the scar will gape, and show
the brick and slated houses through.  BENSON-190X-1,136.853

The little slated turret which I see <font> hurts <$$font> my mind as
often as I think of it.  BENSON-190X-1,136.854

The garden is now full of mounds of earth, pits, trees and branches piled
in heaps, tree-roots, ladders, <P_137> etc. BENSON-190X-1,137.855

Such a routing it has not had for a hundred years.  BENSON-190X-1,137.856

I suppose it is right, BENSON-190X-1,137.857

but it is sad at the time, somehow.  BENSON-190X-1,137.858

The very thing I want to do with the public schools!
BENSON-190X-1,137.859

In rather a sad and fretted hour before the dawn to-day the following
came into my head, BENSON-190X-1,137.860

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know why - BENSON-190X-1,137.861

I seem to have taken leave of poetry.  BENSON-190X-1,137.862

{COM:poem_omitted}

<font> Magdalene, BENSON-190X-1,137.864

February <$$font> 19.  BENSON-190X-1,137.865

- Woke early, much vexed at having to go away again.
BENSON-190X-1,137.866

No letters!  BENSON-190X-1,137.867

{ED:...}

Went pleasantly through to town, through a rain-soaked landscape, much
flood-water out.  BENSON-190X-1,137.869

Sent my things to club; BENSON-190X-1,137.870

and then off to Paddington BENSON-190X-1,137.871

and ran down the familiar line.  BENSON-190X-1,137.872

We were soon at Slough; BENSON-190X-1,137.873

and then the well-known scene, which I have not seen for a year, began
to unfold itself; BENSON-190X-1,137.874

Eton, in its rain-splashed meadows, under a bleared and hurrying sky,
with a hoarse, muddy river plucking at the osiers; BENSON-190X-1,137.875

every window and chimney and tree and hedgerow known to me like my own
body - BENSON-190X-1,137.876

and yet there was I, looking out upon it absolutely without emotion;
rather pleased to know it all so well, as a bird might fly over well-known
fields, but neither desiring to be back, nor regretting the past, nor
wishing <P_138> anything otherwise - with no feeling of tenderness or
sorrow, only glad to be out of it all.  BENSON-190X-1,138.877

It was rather degrading and discreditable; BENSON-190X-1,138.878

but still it is absolutely true.  BENSON-190X-1,138.879

Then I got to the Castle, BENSON-190X-1,138.880

was greeted smilingly by the familiar police and flunkies;
BENSON-190X-1,138.881

found Childers upstairs, everything all exactly the same - the
rooms very comfortable, and Miss Williams working away next door.
BENSON-190X-1,138.882

We did a lot of work, BENSON-190X-1,138.883

went right through all the strong-room papers, BENSON-190X-1,138.884

looked at everything, BENSON-190X-1,138.885

and I went through a whole batch of typewritten papers which had not
been gone through before.  BENSON-190X-1,138.886

Then we lunched BENSON-190X-1,138.887

and worked away quietly; BENSON-190X-1,138.888

then caught 4.25.  BENSON-190X-1,138.889

The Dean in the train.  BENSON-190X-1,138.890

The panorama rolled past me again, with the same insensibility on my part.
BENSON-190X-1,138.891

Then up to London; BENSON-190X-1,138.892

and I had a little talk with the Dean; BENSON-190X-1,138.893

drove off with Childers BENSON-190X-1,138.894

and left him in Trafalgar Square.  BENSON-190X-1,138.895

Then to the National Club - BENSON-190X-1,138.896

read and wrote; BENSON-190X-1,138.897

and then found Gosse, tired and excited, from a long day at House
of Lords.  BENSON-190X-1,138.898

He told me that he had been praising my educational views to Haldane.
BENSON-190X-1,138.899

P. Lubbock to dine.  BENSON-190X-1,138.900

{ED:...}

Then we went BENSON-190X-1,138.902

and talked to Gosse in the smoking-room; BENSON-190X-1,138.903

he was very brilliant and full of finished, amusing, polished
reminiscences of his father and the Plymouth Brethren.
BENSON-190X-1,138.904

Then Gosse fled; BENSON-190X-1,138.905

and Percy and I had some more talk.  BENSON-190X-1,138.906

{ED:...}

I read over what I have written about Eton - BENSON-190X-1,138.908

perhaps I ought not even to put it down - BENSON-190X-1,138.909

'Cast no least thing thou lovedst once away'- BENSON-190X-1,138.910

but I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} put it down as to my credit,
BENSON-190X-1,138.911

only record it as a fact that I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}, and $can $not
{TEXT:cannot}, in thinking it over, feel the <font> least <$$font>
emotion about the place.  BENSON-190X-1,138.912

I am simply glad my time there is over; BENSON-190X-1,138.913

and I saw it as a man might see the galley where he had rowed.
BENSON-190X-1,138.914

<P_139>

<font> Sunday, February <$$font> 25.  BENSON-190X-1,139.916

- Sleepy and stupid.  BENSON-190X-1,139.917

I preached in chapel; BENSON-190X-1,139.918

but the boat had gone to Hunstanton, so the congregation was very small.
BENSON-190X-1,139.919

But I had a pleasure, BENSON-190X-1,139.920

for Rogers came in to my rooms afterwards, to thank me for my sermon.
BENSON-190X-1,139.921

He is an interesting boy.  BENSON-190X-1,139.922

{ED:...}

Then I went for a walk with P. L. BENSON-190X-1,139.924

We found Warre in the garden, in high spirits, trampling among the
flower-beds.  BENSON-190X-1,139.925

{ED:...}

Then P. L. and I walked on, BENSON-190X-1,139.927

and had a long talk about relations with other people - very interesting.
BENSON-190X-1,139.928

I have a sort of feeling, in discussing this subject with him, that
he has a kind of secret, hidden from me, a secret which others share,
in the matter.  BENSON-190X-1,139.929
