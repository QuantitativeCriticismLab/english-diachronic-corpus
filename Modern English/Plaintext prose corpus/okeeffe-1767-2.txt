Scene I.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.5

<font> A Street.  <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.6

<$$heading>

<font> Enter <$$font> Delamour <font> and <$$font> Thady <font> in
travelling dresses, meeting Young <$$font> Woodville.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.8

Young <font> Woodville.  <$$font> Ha!  <font> Delamour!  <$$font> welcome
from <font> Paris <$$font>, my dear friend <font> <paren> embrace;
<$$paren> <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.9

and honest <font> Thady <$$font>, how dost do?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.10

<font> Tha. <$$font> Je vous remercies; I am bravely, sir;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.11

thank your axing.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.12

<font> Del. <$$font> The sight of my dear <font> Woodville <$$font>
, in good health, gives me infinite pleasure.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,1.13

I am well, <P_2> you see; OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.14

but my heart, ah, <font> Woodville <$$font>, not all the sparkling
beauties of the <font> Louvre <$$font> have had power to efface my
charming <font> Emily's <$$font> dear, dear idea.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.15

But how does the lovely girl?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.16

- say, is she in town, that I may fly - OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.17

ha!  what?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.18

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> I am extremely sorry that I am oblig'd
, like your evil genius, to meet you with ill news on your arrival;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.19

but all the consolation I can afford my dear friend, is an assurance of
my sister's constancy - OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.20

To keep you no longer in suspense - my father has promis'd her hand to
Sir <font> Geofry Ginkle <$$font> - OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.21

<font> Del. <$$font> Cursed, infernal avarice!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.22

What motive else could have induced, the hitherto kindest parent, to
make a sacrifice of his darling, his blooming <font> Emily <$$font>,
to such an old - OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.23

By Heaven $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go this instant, OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.24

and - OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.25

<font> Tha. <$$font> Arrah sir, sir, your putting yourself into
passions, and flurries, is mighty silly - mighty silly, upon my soul -
OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.26

Couggar - $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be bound to put you in a way, that you
may have your own game with him.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.27

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you, $d $'ye {TEXT:d'ye} see, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll}
watch this Mr. <font> Gingle <$$font>, if $it $'s {TEXT:it's}
<font> Gingle <$$font> you call him, and Marumshandoul, if I $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} put the speak out of him, OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.28

- and then, when the old devil is quiet in his grave, you may cuckold
him as fast as you please.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.29

Eh, sir, <font> <paren> turning to <$$font> Woodville, <$$paren> $wou'd
$n't {TEXT:wou'dn't} there be some fun in that?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.30

<font> <paren> All this while <$$font> Delamour <font> walks about in
great disorder.  <$$paren> <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,2.31

<P_3>

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> What, <font> Thady <$$font>, sure you
would not commit murder.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.33

<font> Tha. <$$font> Murther, arrah fat {COM:sic}, murther,
OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.34

an ould son of a whore that has one leg already in the grave, and if I
trip the other after it, is that murther?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.35

Oh the devil a murther in that, sure.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.36

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> Come, come, <font> Delamour <$$font>
, OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.37

$do $n't {TEXT:don't} be so uneasy, OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.38

your case is not desperate, OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.39

the indissoluble knot is yet to be tied.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.40

<font> Del. <$$font> Happy <font> Woodville <$$font>, happy in
being conscious you posses my sister's heart unrivall'd, free from
the harsh injunctions of an obdurate parent to thwart your loves -
OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.41

but I - OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.42

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> Ah, <font> Delamour <$$font>, I am
no object to be envied, and far from having an assurance of <font>
Florimel's <$$font> affections; OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.43

happy, then, indeed should I be; OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.44

but she is still the same gay, unthinking, lovely, witty rogue;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.45

if in the most unfeign'd rapture I breathe my love, the return is a loud
laugh, an opera tune, or a ridiculous simile, which, faith, sometimes
makes me look very silly; OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.46

indeed, in her more serious moments, which are but few, she, perhaps,
gives me an hearing, when all at once a crowd of gayer thoughts rush on,
and kill at once the hopes wherewith I was elated a few minutes before.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.47

<font> Del. <$$font> You shall find me a powerful advocate in
your cause, OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.48

but excuse me for deviating from the maxims of our modern professors of
the law; OKEEFFE-1767-2,3.49

my proceedings in your favour, will not be <P_4> wholly disinterested;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.50

you must give me all the assistance in your power, to break the measures
of your father and Sir <font> Geofry <$$font>; OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.51

but how such a notion enter'd into his doating brain, is to me amazing.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.52

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} often heard him express the utmost abhorrence to
matrimony; OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.53

but then, when I reflect upon my <font> Emily's <$$font> beauty,
I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} wonder at his being caught; old goat -
OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.54

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> Love is far from being the sole motive
of Sir <font> Geofry <$$font>'s addresses to <font> Emily; <$$font>
OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.55

the vain hopes of having an heir of his own begetting, to inherit
his estate, <paren> which, you know, is considerable, <$$paren> and to
mortify his nephew; these are the spurs which prick him on , in the road.
which has hitherto appear'd so dreadful to him.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.56

I dare say, you know this nephew; OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.57

as Sir <font> Geofry <$$font> had no children of his own, and intended
never to marry, he bred him up under his own care, OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.58

placed his chief felicity in having him receive those accomplishments ,
proper for a person, who <paren> as he was to inherit Sir <font> Geofry
<$$font>'s estate after his decease <$$paren> probably might make a
figure in the great world; OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.59

these accomplishments, join'd to a natural fine genius, a graceful
person, and a beneficent courteous disposition, gain'd him the esteem
of all who knew him - OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.60

He was the darling of his uncle.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,4.61

But in this happy state, he, following the dictates of love before those
of his interest, unknown to his uncle, espous'd a young lady whose only
want was a fortune sufficient to render <P_5> her a match suitable for
the heir of Sir <font> Geofry.  <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.62

<font> Tha. <$$font> Upon my word I commend his notion.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.63

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> This imprudence of the young gentleman
so exasperated the old knight, that, when he heard of it, he swore he
should never be a shilling the better for him; refus'd to see him ;
and now this unfortunate couple are oblig'd to subsist upon a small
patrimony, left him by his father, in a remote part of <font> Cornwall.
<$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.64

<font> Del. <$$font> By your account, I really pity them,
OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.65

and wish with my soul, for their sake as well as my own, the current of
his affections cou'd be turn'd to its former channel.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.66

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> Oh $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} the most
inflexible, positive Curmudgeon; OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.67

you might as soon persuade a <font> Jewish Rabbi <$$font> to turn <font>
Jesuit.  <$$font>.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.68

<font> Tha. <$$font> A Rabbit turn Jeshit - upon my soul a
comical change.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.69

Howsomever, $they $'ve {TEXT:they've} very pretty boroughs;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.70

where we were they call'em Colleges.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.71

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> $He $'s {TEXT:He's} so fix'd on the
completion of this marriage, that, to make sure of my father's consent
, he has offer'd to take <font> Emily <$$font> without a portion;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.72

there he touch'd the vein; OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.73

my father, at first, shock'd at such an odd proposition, gave his old
friend very little encouragement; OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.74

but the mention of no fortune, together with Sir <font> Geofry's <$$font>
great estate, stifled all parental tenderness, OKEEFFE-1767-2,5.75

and he now exerts all his authority, to <P_6> oblige poor <font> Emily
<$$font> to name the day, and, till then, to look upon Sir <font> Geofry
<$$font> as a gentleman, whom his prudence has destin'd her for a husband.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.76

You may judge the distress these commands gave her, and the conflict she
suffers, between her aversion to Sir <font> Geofry <$$font> , and the
consequence of her acquiescence to her father's will.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.77

<font> Del. <$$font> Poor dear girl!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.78

But cou'd I not get a sight of her?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.79

<font> Wood.  <$$font> Oh, by no means, OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.80

if my father knew of your arrival, $'t $would {TEXT:'twould} bar all
access to your future happiness, as $he $'d {TEXT:he'd} oblige her to
marry Sir <font> Geofry <$$font> immediately; OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.81

as yet, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} not inform <font> Emily <$$font> $you $'re
{TEXT:you're} in town; OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.82

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} meet you this evening at <font> Fynmore's <$$font>
in <font> Pall-mall <$$font>, where, I hope, $we $'ll {TEXT:we'll}
think of some expedients, for our mutual advantages; OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.83

adieu, dear <font> Delamour.  <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,6.84

Emily <font> is discovered sitting melancholy.  <$$font>
OKEEFFE-1767-2,8.123

<font> Emily.  <$$font> How cruel is it for fathers to assume so
unjust a prerogative, as to oblige children to marry who they please.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,8.124

- Because they are the means of bringing us into the world, they think
to be ever after the sole disposers, and masters of our inclinations,
OKEEFFE-1767-2,8.125

and will make us happy, or miserable, according to their capricious
tempers.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,8.126

Ah, unkind <font> Delamour!  <$$font> after repeated vows of inviolable
constancy, to leave me to the perils I now suffer - on the eve of being

Let me think now of all the different disasters which I suffered last
night; OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.596

first, after putting myself in a good sweat, by limping after an hackney
coach, and to no effect, I must cool myself, by tumbling over head and
heels, in a filthy kennel, by way of a Somerset; OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.597

then I was in danger of suffocating, and the breaking of my neck;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.598

next, I that was never over valiant, must make a trial of my prowess ,
on an <font> Irishman <$$font> a fellow with muscles, firm as his country
oak; OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.599

but, indeed I must do him the justice to own, that he exercis'd some of
the generosity of an <font> Irishman <$$font>, by not pounding me to
mummy, when he got me down, which I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} deny but I
deserv'd; OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.600

then to be lugg'd to the Round-house, like a thief, where I was almost
stifled with tobacco - OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.601

Well, that expell'd viler scents, with which, I suppose, the place
abounded, among cut-throats, pickpockets - OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.602

Oh, here comes Sir <font> Anthony.  <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.603

OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.608

Sir <font> Anthony <$$font>, I thank you, OKEEFFE-1767-2,26.609

Sir <font> Ant. <$$font> But what?  what?  OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.612

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Tho'for reasons which, perhaps, you may

my marriage with your daughter - OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.613

Sir <font> Ant. <$$font> How!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.614

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Yes, sir, with your daughter;

Stop the proceedings of the marriage!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.619

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Yes, sir, upon cool and proper reflection,
$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} consider'd $'t $would {TEXT:'twould} be a very
imprudent thing for a person of my age, in the wane of life, to espouse
a lady so young, and possessed of so much beauty, as Miss <font> Emily.
<$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.620

Sir <font> Ant - <$$font> Sir <font> Geofry <$$font>, Sir <font> Geofry

OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.622

and $do $n't {TEXT:don't} think it shall pass with impunity -
OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.623

But, sir, I see, I see thro'the shallow gloss $you $'ve {TEXT:you've}

I see your mean, sordid reason for recanting, your repentance of the offer
you made me of taking my child without a portion; OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.625

Fye!  fye!  fye!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,27.627

<font> Delamour <$$font> accidentally dropt it out of his pocket,
OKEEFFE-1767-2,28.637

and I pick'd it up; OKEEFFE-1767-2,28.638

your exposing her in that manner would be wrong, quite wrong.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,28.654

Give me leave to advise you - OKEEFFE-1767-2,28.655

Keep the whole a secret, <P_29> even from your servants;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.656

as for <font> Betty <$$font>, she has been her confidant;
OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.657

OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.659

I know his circumstances perfectly, as some of his land borders upon mine.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.660

He has a very pretty estate, but a little encumbered, owing to some
extravagancies incident to young men of his volatile disposition.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.661

The fortune which I refused with <font> Emily <$$font>, will help to clear
his estate, and pay off his sister <font> $Florimel $'s {TEXT:Florimel's}
<$$font> fortune; OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.662

these considerations, joined to an innate principle of honour, which
I never knew him deviate from, till now, perhaps may influence him to
accept of your offer; OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.663

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you mention the least knowledge of their

But though she has gone astray, yet she is still my child.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,29.669

- Were I sure $he $'d {TEXT:he'd} cover her shame by marriage, with

a likely thing, a young fellow, like him, would for himself for life to

OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.778

<font> Del. <bracket> They both kneel.  <$$bracket> <$$font>
And now, sir, on my knees, I thank you for this precious gem, which to

<font> Enter Sir <$$font> Geofry, <font> who starts back at seeing them

Sir <font> Ant. <$$font> Heaven bless my children,

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Ha, this, indeed, is joyful!
OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.785

Adod, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} glad of it; OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.786

$'t $was {TEXT:'twas} more than I expected.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.787

<font> Enter <$$font> Florimel <font> and Young <$$font> Woodville,
<font> hand in hand, follow'd by <$$font> Thady <font> and <$$font>
Betty, <font> in the same manner - OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.788

The two former kneel to Sir <$$font> Anthony.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.789

Y. <font> Wood.  <$$font> Dearest father, extend to us
your blessing, that we may participate in the general joy -
OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.790

<font> Sir Ant. <$$font> How!  since $'t $is {TEXT:'tis}
so, if your father's blessing makes you happy, my children be so.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,34.791

<P_35>

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Rare doings!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.793

- <font> Tha. <$$font> Ohono, since $you $'re {TEXT:you're}
sharing the blessing, I hope my spouse and $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} come in
for snacks - OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.794

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Oh, ho, are you there?
OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.795

<font> Del. <$$font> So, <font> Thady <$$font>, $you $'ve
{TEXT:you've} got a mate: OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.796

Well, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} do something more than wish you joy -
OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.797

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} comprehend the
meaning of all this rightly; OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.798

aded, I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} fathom it - OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.799

Ah, $there $'s {TEXT:there's} a great deal of the profound in it.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.800

- <font> Flor. <$$font> Then, sir, since your $sagacity $'s
{TEXT:sagacity's} not of a sufficient length to reach the bottom, I
must give you a line to eke it out, and to right my innocent friend,
who has suffered so much in your opinions.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.801

Now, Sir <font> Geofry <$$font>, and you, Sir <font> Anthony <$$font>
, look upon <font> Emily <$$font> in a different light than what $you
$'ve {TEXT:you've} lately done - OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.802

She had a gallant, OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.803

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} true, OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.804

and here he stands, in the circumference of this simple petticoat, to
hinder a preposterous match between Sir <font> Geofry <$$font> and my
dear <font> Emily <$$font>, which would render her inevitably miserable.
OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.805

I wrote you, Sir <font> Geofry <$$font>, that anonymous letter, to which
you gave so much credit; OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.806

and in that suit of cloaths, which now my brother wears, I personated
your imaginary rival, OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.807

dropt the billet of assignation, which you found and shew'd Sir <font>
Anthony.  <$$font> OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.808

These machinations of mine having had such happy effects, and as my
real motive for deceiving you both, proceeded from my eagerness to
serve my dear <font> Emily <$$font>, - I hope $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll}
both forgive me.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,35.809

<P_36>

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> And is this all orthodox?
OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.811

<font> Bet. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know what <font>
dox <$$font> it is, OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.812

but indeed, sir, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} true.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.813

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> Ay, ay, you were a party concern'd:
OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.814

Well, I forgive you.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.815

Sir <font> Ant. <$$font> So, $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} a Female

<font> Del. <$$font> $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} as much amaz'd at this,
as any one here; OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.819

for upon my honour, till now, I was entirely ignorant of every single
particular.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.820

Sir <font> Geo. <$$font> And so, you mad wench, you were the
Cuckold-maker I so much dreaded, OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.821

and $you $'ve {TEXT:you've} bilk'd me of my wife.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.822

- <font> Delamour <$$font>, with your leave, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} <font>
salute <$$font> your intended - <bracket> <font> Kisses.  <$$font>

Ah, you are a happy dog!  OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.824

for, by the la, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} settle a thousand pounds upon the
first boy.  OKEEFFE-1767-2,36.826

Flor. <font> And you.  wise father, when you wou'd compel Your
