<$$heading>

Scene, - <font> A fashionably furnished Apartment in Peter Popple's
Villa at Norwood.  COYNE-1855-2,3.6

The apartment is semi-circular at the upper end, with three large French
windows opening on the ornamental grounds of the Villa; COYNE-1855-2,3.7

a breakfast table laid, <$$font> C. R.; COYNE-1855-2,3.8

<font> a lady's work table, L. C.; <$$font> COYNE-1855-2,3.9

<font> door of Popple's private room, <$$font> R. 2 E.;
COYNE-1855-2,3.11

<font> a parrot on a perch at back.  <$$font> COYNE-1855-2,3.12

James, <font> a footman, discovered asleep in an easy chair, <$$font>
R. C.; COYNE-1855-2,3.13

<font> a newspaper lies at his feet.  COYNE-1855-2,3.14

Enter <$$font> Mincing, L. D. COYNE-1855-2,3.15

Mincing.  James, James.  COYNE-1855-2,3.16

Goodness, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} asleep!  COYNE-1855-2,3.17

<paren> <font> goes to him and calls loudly <$$font> <$$paren> James!
COYNE-1855-2,3.18

James.  <paren> <font> starting up <$$font> <$$paren> Hey!  $What $'s
{TEXT:What's} the matter?  COYNE-1855-2,3.19

Haw - <paren> <font> yawning <$$font> <$$paren> - Mincing, I believe I
was obliverous.  COYNE-1855-2,3.20

Mincing.  Obliverous!  COYNE-1855-2,3.21

You were fast asleep, James.  COYNE-1855-2,3.22

James.  Really, the Parliament speeches is so dreadful heavy,
COYNE-1855-2,3.23

and we were late at the hoprer last night.  COYNE-1855-2,3.24

Mincing.  Yes, $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} near two o'clock before mistress
came home.  COYNE-1855-2,3.25

James.  <font> Aproposs, <$$font> as we say in the classics, Mincing,
I was quite shocked at a report I heard.  COYNE-1855-2,3.26

Mincing.  What report?  COYNE-1855-2,3.27

James.  Why, they say $we $'re {TEXT:we're} <font> parwenews.  <$$font>
COYNE-1855-2,3.28

Mincing.  <font> Parwenews!  <$$font> Good gracious!  COYNE-1855-2,3.29

James.  $Is $n't {TEXT:Isn't} it disgusting?  COYNE-1855-2,3.30

Mincing.  Dreadful!  COYNE-1855-2,3.31

But are you sure of this, James?  COYNE-1855-2,3.32

James.  Sure!  COYNE-1855-2,3.33

Sir William Fluke's tiger pledged his honor it was a fact!
COYNE-1855-2,3.34

Mincing.  Oh, if Sir William's tiger pledged his honor, there can be no
doubt about it.  COYNE-1855-2,3.35

James.  I always suspected Mr. Popples since I see him eat green
peas with his knife.  COYNE-1855-2,3.36

Mincing.  Hush, here he comes.  COYNE-1855-2,3.37

<font> Exit <$$font> James, L. D. COYNE-1855-2,3.38

<font> Enter <$$font> Popples <font> from room, R.,
COYNE-1855-2,3.39

he casts a glance at breakfast table, COYNE-1855-2,3.40

and looks at his watch.  <$$font> COYNE-1855-2,3.41

Pop. Mistress not down yet, Mincing?  COYNE-1855-2,3.42

Mincing.  Not yet, sir; COYNE-1855-2,3.43

but $she $'ll {TEXT:she'll} be here presently.  <font> Exit, <$$font>
L. COYNE-1855-2,3.44

Pop. Twelve o'clock, and not down to breakfast yet.
COYNE-1855-2,3.45

A few months ago, when I was a happy doll maker, she used to rise with
<P_4> the lark - that is, not exactly with the lark, for larks $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} rise in Mile End - but with the earliest sparrow in the
neighbourhood; COYNE-1855-2,4.46

but ever since I came into this unlucky fortune, her poor little head
has been turned, COYNE-1855-2,4.47

and nothing will serve but I must take a country villa, and give up my
shop, and my dolls, and my old friends; and eat, drink, sleep, and dress
as she pleases - because, as she says, $it $'s {TEXT:it's} fashionable.
COYNE-1855-2,4.48

<paren> Mrs. Popples <font> is heard laughing outside.  <$$font>
L. <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.49

There she is at last, COYNE-1855-2,4.50

bless her dear merry laugh - COYNE-1855-2,4.51

it reminds me of the happy days when she $was $n't {TEXT:wasn't} afraid
to be natural.  COYNE-1855-2,4.52

<font> Enter <$$font> Mrs. Popples, L., <font> in an
elegant morning costume, COYNE-1855-2,4.53

Mrs. P. Six!  COYNE-1855-2,4.59

Mercy on me, how have you contrived to amuse yourself all this time?
COYNE-1855-2,4.60

<paren> Alphonse, <font> who has poured out coffee, hands it to <$$font>
Mrs. Popples <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.61

Pop. A - hem - <paren> <font> embarrassed <$$font> <$$paren>
For the first three hours, I watched the gold fish wagging their little
tails in the glass globe; COYNE-1855-2,4.62

but the study of natural history becoming tiresome, I turned my attention
to passing events COYNE-1855-2,4.63

and counted the cabs and shays on the road.  COYNE-1855-2,4.64

Mrs. P. Chaises, my love.  COYNE-1855-2,4.65

Pop. Well chayzes - COYNE-1855-2,4.66

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} all the same, COYNE-1855-2,4.67

only $you $'re {TEXT:you're} so particular with your French, because
you spent twelve months with your aunt, the schoolmistress, at Boulogne.
COYNE-1855-2,4.68

Mrs. P. Ha, ha, ha, ha!  - $You $'re {TEXT:You're}
delightfully droll.  COYNE-1855-2,4.69

You may go, Alphonse - ha, ha, ha!  COYNE-1855-2,4.70

<paren> Alphonse <font> is going <$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.71

Mrs. P. Ha, ha, ha!  <paren> <font> Changing her tone
<$$font> <$$paren> Popples, why will you expose yourself and me in this
manner, before your domestics?  COYNE-1855-2,4.74

You forget that our position in life is not now what it once was.
COYNE-1855-2,4.75

Pop. I have a painful conviction of the fact.  COYNE-1855-2,4.76

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} take a cup of tea, my dear.  COYNE-1855-2,4.77

<paren> <font> she pours out tea <$$font> <$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,4.78

Mrs. P. You ought to be the happiest man in existence.
COYNE-1855-2,4.79

Blessed with an ample fortune - Pop. Which I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
know how to spend.  COYNE-1855-2,4.80

Mrs. P. My love, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} do that for you.
COYNE-1855-2,4.81

You live in an elegant villa at Norwood - COYNE-1855-2,4.82

Pop. I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} like it - COYNE-1855-2,4.83

I was more comfortable at Mile End.  COYNE-1855-2,4.84

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} too much fresh air going to waste here;
COYNE-1855-2,4.85

$it $'s {TEXT:it's} a shameful expenditure of nature's property.
COYNE-1855-2,4.86

<paren> Mrs. Popples <font> hands him a cup of tea <$$font>
<$$paren> Thank you, my dear.  COYNE-1855-2,4.87

Mrs. P. Then you have a host of friends who are all
sincerely attached to you.  COYNE-1855-2,4.88

Pop. I know it; COYNE-1855-2,4.89

attached to me, and to my dinners; COYNE-1855-2,4.90

attached to my old wines, and my young - hem - COYNE-1855-2,4.91

$there $'s {TEXT:there's} a leaf left on it to devour.  COYNE-1855-2,4.94

<P_5>

Mrs. P. Ridiculous!  COYNE-1855-2,5.96

<paren> <font> he pours his tea from his cup into the slop basin <$$font>
<$$paren> COYNE-1855-2,5.97

Why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you drink your tea from the cup, my dear?
COYNE-1855-2,5.98

Pop. Because I like it better from a bowl, my dear -
COYNE-1855-2,5.99

you remember I always had my tea in a bowl when I made dolls at Mile End.
COYNE-1855-2,5.100

Mrs. P. I wish you would try and forget Mile End and your
dolls, Mr. Popples.  COYNE-1855-2,5.101

Pop. $That $'s {TEXT:That's} impossible, Mrs. Popples -
morally impossible.  COYNE-1855-2,5.102

I can never forget the lovely creatures, with their soft flaxen hair
curling round their little pink cheeks, and those beautiful blue eyes
turning all manner of ways, that bring tears to mine when I think of them.
COYNE-1855-2,5.103

Forget my dolls!  COYNE-1855-2,5.104

No, Mrs. Popples, I trust I have the feelings of a doll maker too
strong in my bosom, ever to forget the sweet smiling innocents that owed
their existence to these hands.  COYNE-1855-2,5.105

Mrs. P. Well, my dear, I only hope you will suppress your
feelings in the presence of our aristocratic friends, who are coming to
spend a few days with us.  COYNE-1855-2,5.106

Pop. What, move?  COYNE-1855-2,5.107

Why the house will be full of them: COYNE-1855-2,5.108

they swarm to it like blue-bottles to a pastry cook's window in the dog
days, COYNE-1855-2,5.109

and nearly drive me mad.  COYNE-1855-2,5.110

Mrs. P. How strangely tastes differ.  COYNE-1855-2,5.111

For my part, I like the excitement of a house full of company -
COYNE-1855-2,5.112

nature, I suppose, formed me for fashionable life.  COYNE-1855-2,5.113

Pop. $Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} blame nature, Polly: COYNE-1855-2,5.114

- nature formed you for a good sensible little wife, COYNE-1855-2,5.115

but art has well nigh spoiled you.  COYNE-1855-2,5.116

Nature never taught you to turn day-light into wax-light, to risk your
money at a card table, or to lose your complexion at night in a ball room
, and buy a fresh one in the morning at a perfumer's.  COYNE-1855-2,5.117

Mrs. P. <paren> <font> laughing <$$font> <$$paren> I
protest, Popples, COYNE-1855-2,5.118

you wrong me about my complexion.  COYNE-1855-2,5.119

As yet, I have not been obliged to mend my damaged charms by art like
Lady Oldham, who spends the morning stuccoing and patching her face,
and comes out in the evening like one of those repaired portraits one
sees in a picture cleaner's window, where they write up,"Heads restored
in this style. "COYNE-1855-2,5.120

Pop. Well, I suppose I must - COYNE-1855-2,5.128

these are arguments that no man can resist.  COYNE-1855-2,5.129

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} sorry though $they $'re {TEXT:they're} coming to-day,
COYNE-1855-2,5.130

for I expect a visitor who may not perhaps be the sort of person who -
COYNE-1855-2,5.131

Mrs. P. A visitor - COYNE-1855-2,5.132

who is it?  COYNE-1855-2,5.133

Pop. Our old friend Skrymsher - Sam Skrymsher from Lincolnshire.
COYNE-1855-2,5.134

Mrs. P. What, Skrymsher, that vulgar creature?
COYNE-1855-2,5.135

Oh, Popples, how could you?  COYNE-1855-2,5.136

- what will our friends say?  COYNE-1855-2,5.137

Do contrive some plan to keep him out of the way - COYNE-1855-2,5.138

or, better, if you were to let him perceive that his visit is not
agreeable, that he is <font> de trop <$$font>.  COYNE-1855-2,5.139

Pop. What, give the cold shoulder to Sam Skrymsher?
COYNE-1855-2,5.140

No, Polly, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} be hanged if I do that.  COYNE-1855-2,5.141

I $can $n't {TEXT:can't} forget that he was my best friend when I
wanted one, that he lent me three hundred <P_6> pounds when we married
to set up in business, and that he used to send us up the fattest goose
in Lincolnshire, and buy the biggest doll in my shop every Christmas.
COYNE-1855-2,6.142

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} ask me to cut such a man.  COYNE-1855-2,6.143

you $do $n't {TEXT:don't} love me any longer.  COYNE-1855-2,6.147

Pop. My darling Polly, you know - COYNE-1855-2,6.148

Mrs. P. I know I am an unhappy woman.  COYNE-1855-2,6.149

Reach me a chair.  COYNE-1855-2,6.150

COYNE-1855-2,7.212

You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} look so brisk as you used to.
COYNE-1855-2,7.213

Any thing wrong?  COYNE-1855-2,7.214

Come, what is it?  COYNE-1855-2,7.215

I see $you $'re {TEXT:you're} not happy.  COYNE-1855-2,7.216

Pop. <paren> R. <$$paren> Well, I $do $n't {TEXT:don't}
think I am; COYNE-1855-2,7.217

in fact, I suspect $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} very miserable.  COYNE-1855-2,7.218

This sort of life $do $n't {TEXT:don't} suit me; COYNE-1855-2,7.219

a thousand times a day I wish that my uncle Jackson had left his fortune
to somebody else.  COYNE-1855-2,7.220

$It $'s {TEXT:It's} too much for me.  COYNE-1855-2,7.221

Skrym. <paren> L. <$$paren> Hob!  I knew it.
COYNE-1855-2,7.222

Always said that the sweets of fortune would not agree with you.
COYNE-1855-2,7.223

$You $'re {TEXT:You're} smothered in prosperity, Peter.
COYNE-1855-2,7.224

Pop. You $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know my sufferings, trying to get
through the day doing nothing.  COYNE-1855-2,7.225

I should have died in a month if I had not contrived a little amusement
for myself, unknown to Mrs. P. COYNE-1855-2,7.226

Skrym. Nothing irregular I hope, Peter?  COYNE-1855-2,7.227

Pop. Oh dear no!  COYNE-1855-2,7.228

Polly reigns sole mistress of the little tenement inside my waistcoat -
COYNE-1855-2,7.229

but there is a secret which $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} confide to you, Sam.
COYNE-1855-2,7.230

You must know that Mrs. P. $can $n't {TEXT:can't} abide
the sight of a doll, COYNE-1855-2,7.231

the very mention of one makes her ill, lest people, as she says, should
suspect the fact of my having been a doll maker.  COYNE-1855-2,7.232

Skrym. Bah!  A weak woman!  COYNE-1855-2,7.233

Pop. Yes; but the weakest of them are too strong for us, Sam.
COYNE-1855-2,7.234

Skrym. Perhaps so - COYNE-1855-2,7.235

$can $n't {TEXT:can't} say as I never speculated in the article.
COYNE-1855-2,7.236

Go on.  COYNE-1855-2,7.237

Pop. Now in this respect I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} at all coincide
with Mrs. P. COYNE-1855-2,7.238

- $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} an enthusiast in dolls, COYNE-1855-2,7.239

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} made them and lived among them all my life,
COYNE-1855-2,7.240

and I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} mind confessing that my earliest love was
for a splendid wax doll, with joints and turning eyes: COYNE-1855-2,7.241

- she was sent to Russia, Sam, COYNE-1855-2,7.242

and I afterwards married Polly, because she was like that doll.
COYNE-1855-2,7.243

Skrym. Well, but the secret?  COYNE-1855-2,7.244

Pop. $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} coming to it.  COYNE-1855-2,7.245

$I $'ve {TEXT:I've} had a notion for a long time, that a great improvement
might be made in the construction of dolls, COYNE-1855-2,7.246

so as I had nothing better to do, I set to work in that room, <paren>
<font> points to <$$font> R. <$$paren> of which I keep the key,
COYNE-1855-2,7.247

and every hour that I can manage to steal away, I employ making a model
doll that will astonish the world.  COYNE-1855-2,7.248

Skrym. You think so?  COYNE-1855-2,7.249

Pop. $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} certain of it.  COYNE-1855-2,7.250

By a curious complication of springs and bellows, I can make it imitate
the human voice, COYNE-1855-2,7.251

and already it calls"mamma,"in the sweetest infantine tone you ever heard.
COYNE-1855-2,7.252

Skrym. Nonsense - $you $'re {TEXT:you're} losing your wits,
Peter - COYNE-1855-2,7.253

$you $'ve {TEXT:you've} run doll mad.  COYNE-1855-2,7.254

Pop. Ah, you think $it $'s {TEXT:it's} impossible,
COYNE-1855-2,7.255

but come with me and you <P_8> shall judge for yourself;
COYNE-1855-2,8.256

you shall see it, Sam - COYNE-1855-2,8.257

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} show you how it works.  COYNE-1855-2,8.258

Skrym. Ay!  Well it must be curious.  COYNE-1855-2,8.259

You always had a wonderful head - COYNE-1855-2,8.260

but $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you think a little refreshment might be
agreeable at the same time?  COYNE-1855-2,8.261

Pop. Refreshment - ah, to be sure!  COYNE-1855-2,8.262

I forgot that you have had a ride from town.  COYNE-1855-2,8.263

<paren> <font> aside <$$font> <$$paren> A thought strikes me;

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} try to keep him in the doll room till my wife's

I say, Skrymsher, as Mrs. P. $do $n't {TEXT:don't} dine
till six, what do you say to an early bit of dinner to ourselves in my
room, amongst the dolls, eh?  snug and quiet, eh?  COYNE-1855-2,8.266

nobody to disturb us - and a comfortable pipe afterwards, eh?
COYNE-1855-2,8.267

Skrym. The very thing $I $'d {TEXT:I'd} like; COYNE-1855-2,8.268

none of those fellows with a top dressing of flour upon their heads,
standing behind our chairs.  COYNE-1855-2,8.269

Pop. Nothing of the kind - perfectly private, COYNE-1855-2,8.270

nobody is ever permitted to set foot in that room but myself.
COYNE-1855-2,8.271

You go in, Sam, COYNE-1855-2,8.272

COYNE-1855-2,8.277

Good heavens!  $there $'s {TEXT:there's} Captain Hawkshaw, my sporting
friend!  COYNE-1855-2,8.278

The sight of him throws me into a cold perspiration - COYNE-1855-2,8.279

$he $'s {TEXT:he's} always getting me to bet upon some horse that
never starts.  COYNE-1855-2,8.280

I should not, however, mind losing my money, if he $had $n't {TEXT:hadn't}
a design upon my life.  COYNE-1855-2,8.281

It was only last week he persuaded me to buy a splendid horse, that he
told me was going a dead bargain - COYNE-1855-2,8.282

but, egad, it was I who was near being the dead bargain,
COYNE-1855-2,8.283

for the brute tumbled on his nose, COYNE-1855-2,8.284

Flap. Thank you, Mr. Popples.  COYNE-1855-2,8.297

My friend, Hawkshaw, knowing how anxious I was to make your acquaintance ,
drove me down.  COYNE-1855-2,8.298

Hawk. Twenty minutes and fifteen seconds from Charing Cross in
my phaeton; COYNE-1855-2,8.299

not bad going that.  COYNE-1855-2,8.300

By-the-bye, you $have $n't {TEXT:haven't} seen my pair of duns!
COYNE-1855-2,8.301

Pop. Your duns?  COYNE-1855-2,8.302

No, where are they?  COYNE-1855-2,8.303

Hawk. In the phaeton, at the door.  COYNE-1855-2,8.304

Pop. They stick pretty close to you.  COYNE-1855-2,8.305

Do you owe them much?  COYNE-1855-2,8.306

Hawk. Owe them?  COYNE-1855-2,8.307

Oh, $you $'re {TEXT:you're} in the wrong stall.  COYNE-1855-2,8.308

$They $'re {TEXT:They're} none of your rascally creditors, but a pair

I brought them down on purpose to show them to you.  COYNE-1855-2,8.310

$They $'re {TEXT:They're} the very things you want, Popples.

you know $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} your friend, and would not advise you to do

On second thoughts you had better take the phaeton with the horses,
COYNE-1855-2,9.328

it would be a thousand pities to separate them.  COYNE-1855-2,9.329

Mrs. P. Amazingly cheap.  COYNE-1855-2,9.332

Mrs. P. My dear Poppy, you should be exceedingly obliged

every gentleman should learn to drive, COYNE-1855-2,9.345

Mrs. P. And you have really forsaken the brilliant soirees

Veneer.  Nay, madam!  the circle of which Mrs. Popples forms the

Mrs. P. Very pretty and complimentary.  COYNE-1855-2,10.406

I permit you to make me these flattering speeches in the absence of the

Oh dear, no!  COYNE-1855-2,11.419

Perhaps some forty years hence, when I have drained the wine from the

the dregs with some fortunate woman.  COYNE-1855-2,11.420

Veneer.  Well, positively, there is something in the idea of marriage,
