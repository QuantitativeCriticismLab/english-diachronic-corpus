Sermon XIV.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.3

Lord's Prayer: HARE-183X-2,2,240.4

Fourth Part.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.5

God's Will, Not Ours.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.6

Luke xi. 2.  Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
HARE-183X-2,2,240.7

<$$heading>

In my last sermon I spoke to you about the nature of God's kingdom,
for the coming of which our Lord teaches us to pray.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.9

I shewed you that it was a threefold kingdom.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.10

I explained to you that, when we say, Thy kingdom come, we pray first
for God's spiritual kingdom, that it may be set up and established in
our hearts; secondly, for his visible kingdom, or Church, that it may
increase and spread, until it fill the whole earth; and lastly, for
his heavenly kingdom, that it may soon drive away and put an end to
every kind of sin and sorrow, and leave nothing to be seen in the new
heavens and the new earth, which God will then create, but a glorious
God, filling all things with his presence, and ruling with a father's
love over his dutiful and holy children.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.11

In a word, when we say, Thy kingdom come, we pray God to put forth
his royal power, and to shew himself the sovereign of all the earth
so plainly and openly, that we and all the other sons of men may, both
outwardly with our eyes, and inwardly in our hearts, see and feel and
own him to be our king.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.12

But a king must have subjects.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.13

A king without subjects to obey him, a king without a people to love
and follow him, would be a sorry sight.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.14

He would be merely the mockery of a king, and no more a real one, than
a shadow is a living man.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.15

It is not enough therefore that we call God King, and Jesus Lord, unless
we do the things which they command us.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.16

It is not enough for God's kingdom to come, HARE-183X-2,2,240.17

in fact it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come properly and as it ought to come
, HARE-183X-2,2,240.18

it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come in all its fulness and excellence,
unless God's will be also done.  HARE-183X-2,2,240.19

This however is so unpleasant to man, HARE-183X-2,2,240.20

- this doing God's will is so hard and grating to flesh and blood,
especially in the beginning of our course, - that perhaps there is no
truth in the whole Gospel which we are readier and more anxious to forget
, than this great one, that it is <P_2,242> doing, and not saying only,
that God requires of us.  HARE-183X-2,2,242.21

The promises of the Gospel are great and glorious; HARE-183X-2,2,242.22

and we are glad to lay claim to them.  HARE-183X-2,2,242.23

The forms of religion may seem a little tiresome to us;
HARE-183X-2,2,242.24

still we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} feel comfortable, if we keep away from
them altogether; HARE-183X-2,2,242.25

and so we bring ourselves not to neglect them.  HARE-183X-2,2,242.26

But the doing God's will as he would have us, - though this, you must be
aware, is the pith and kernel of the whole matter, - the doing it wholly
and thoroughly, at all times and in all places, the obeying God with that
perfect obedience which he demands of us, - an obedience which extends
to all our words and thoughts, as well as to all our outward actions, -
an obedience which brings every power of our minds, and every feeling
of our hearts, and every member of our bodies, under ready subjection
to the will of God, - this is the great difficulty which stops so many
in their Christian journey.  HARE-183X-2,2,242.27

It is like a great steep mountain, which blocks up the road to heaven:
HARE-183X-2,2,242.28

and some of us waste our time in trying to find a path round it;
HARE-183X-2,2,242.29

and some of us fall asleep at the foot of it; HARE-183X-2,2,242.30

and some of us in despair turn our backs on it, HARE-183X-2,2,242.31

and set our faces toward the way of sin and death: HARE-183X-2,2,242.32

but few, very few have the wisdom and the courage to say within
themselves,"The city of our God and King is at the top of that steep
mountain: HARE-183X-2,2,242.33

unless <P_2,243> I climb the mountain, I can never get there:
HARE-183X-2,2,243.34

so the sooner I begin the better.  HARE-183X-2,2,243.35

True, the mountain does seem very steep now that I am looking up it from
the bottom: HARE-183X-2,2,243.36

but the ascent may not be so difficult as it appears: HARE-183X-2,2,243.37

and at any rate, in the strength of my God and King, and through
faith in Jesus Christ, the Bible assures me I can do all things.
HARE-183X-2,2,243.38

Therefore I will begin to climb at once. "HARE-183X-2,2,243.39

Few persons have wisdom and courage enough to make up their minds
to follow the will of God in this plain straightforward manner.
HARE-183X-2,2,243.40

Most men want to avoid it if they can.  HARE-183X-2,2,243.41

Some would compound for their duty, by keeping God's law whenever they
have a mind to it, or whenever they are not particularly tempted to the
contrary; HARE-183X-2,2,243.42

or perhaps they might consent to keep the greater part of it, provided
they are allowed to indulge now and then in some little darling sin.
HARE-183X-2,2,243.43

But the trying to keep the whole of the perfect law of God, the endeavour
to act up to all the heavenly precepts delivered in the Sermon on
the Mount, this is so distasteful to flesh and blood, we have need
to be continually reminded that God will not be satisfied with less.
HARE-183X-2,2,243.44

Therefore Christ has taken care to remind us of it, by making it a part
of our daily prayers.  HARE-183X-2,2,243.45

He has commanded us, when we pray, to say, not only, Thy kingdom come,
but also, Thy will be done.  HARE-183X-2,2,243.46

<P_2,244>

This indeed is the petition with which we have the closest concern.
HARE-183X-2,2,244.48

It shews us what ought to be the great aim and end of our lives, -
that we may be able to do the will of God.  HARE-183X-2,2,244.49

After praying to our Father that his name may be hallowed, and that his
kingdom may come, we pray that his will may be done: HARE-183X-2,2,244.50

for unless his will be done, his kingdom $can $not {TEXT:cannot} come,
HARE-183X-2,2,244.51

his name $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be hallowed.  HARE-183X-2,2,244.52

Or can a father be said to be honoured by his children, while they are
disobeying him?  HARE-183X-2,2,244.53

Can a king be said to reign over his subjects, while they are rebelling
against him?  HARE-183X-2,2,244.54

Here I would have you mark our Lord's word.  HARE-183X-2,2,244.55

He does not bid us pray that God's laws may be obeyed, or that
his commandments may be kept, but that his will may be done.
HARE-183X-2,2,244.56

Now why is this?  HARE-183X-2,2,244.57

Plainly, because the doing God's will embraces everything else.
HARE-183X-2,2,244.58

It includes all obedience and submission and patience and humility,
the virtues most desirable in a Christian.  HARE-183X-2,2,244.59

Besides, by teaching us to pray that God's will may be done, or, in other
words, by teaching us that we are to strive to make God's will our own,
which of course is the thing meant, Jesus struck at the taproot of the
evil in our fallen and corrupted nature.  HARE-183X-2,2,244.60

The great mischief of the fall of Adam was, that it burst the golden
chain which bound man to God.  HARE-183X-2,2,244.61

Man broke loose from God, HARE-183X-2,2,244.62

and made himself independent of <P_2,245> him, HARE-183X-2,2,245.63

and left the safe and the straight way of his commandments, to walk
in the light of his own eyes, and after the devices of his own heart.
HARE-183X-2,2,245.64

In short, man at the fall set up his own will against God's;
HARE-183X-2,2,245.65

and so his will became corrupt and tainted, as everything must become
when God's purifying spirit leaves it.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.66

Man set up his own will.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.67

This is the great disease and the main evil of our nature.
HARE-183X-2,2,245.68

It comes to us from our parents: HARE-183X-2,2,245.69

it shews itself soon after our birth: HARE-183X-2,2,245.70

and the seeds of it continue to lurk, even in the best of men, as long
as they remain in the body.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.71

The disease, I say, shews itself soon after our birth.
HARE-183X-2,2,245.72

If you doubt this, look at infants.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.73

Mark how violent and fretful they become, even while they are still in
arms, if you do the least thing to cross them.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.74

But perhaps you will say,"They are only babies, HARE-183X-2,2,245.75

and $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know any better. "HARE-183X-2,2,245.76

Well!  wait till they do know better; HARE-183X-2,2,245.77

wait till they are five or six years old.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.78

Is the matter improved then?  HARE-183X-2,2,245.79

You know that, generally speaking, it is not.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.80

You know that your complaint of your child at six years old is the
same that it was at fifteen months:"The child will have its own way.
"HARE-183X-2,2,245.81

You are quite right: HARE-183X-2,2,245.82

the child will have its own way, unless you take great pains to teach
it better.  HARE-183X-2,2,245.83

And when it grows up to be a boy, it will try to have its own way as a
boy: HARE-183X-2,2,245.84

and when it grows up to be <P_2,246> a man, it will try to have its own
way as a man.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.85

Nay, at threescore and ten, if God spares its life so long, unless its
heart has been renewed before hand, we should still have the very same
story: HARE-183X-2,2,246.86

we should still see the old man, with white hairs on his head, and a
crutch in his hand, and one foot in the grave, HARE-183X-2,2,246.87

- if we could read his heart, we should still see him making a point of
having his own way.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.88

Another proof of the same thing, were further proof needful, might be
found in the common saying,"I will do it, because I choose it, ". ...
not because I think it right, not because I shall do myself any good by
it, but because I choose it: that is, because it is my will, and I have
the power of doing it, and nobody shall hinder me.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.89

A foolisher answer than this, or a worse answer, or an answer more
unworthy of a Christian, or even of a reasonable being, there $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.90

Yet I dare say most of you must have heard it.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.91

I have myself often heard it made by boys.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.92

And though men, when they are grown up, are mostly too much on their
guard to avow so absurd a feeling, yet the same love of doing a thing
merely because one chooses it, without any better reason, is far too
common among men also: HARE-183X-2,2,246.93

in truth, it lies at the bottom of half the foolish obstinacy in the
world.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.94

But it is useless to argue the matter further.  HARE-183X-2,2,246.95

It is <P_2,247> a question of mere fact; HARE-183X-2,2,247.96

every one, without argument, may decide it for himself by looking into
his own heart.  HARE-183X-2,2,247.97

Ask yourselves, Do not you like to have your own way, because it is your
own way?  and that too even when some other way, which a neighbour points
out to you, is clearly more for your good.  HARE-183X-2,2,247.98

Now what is the cause of all this?  HARE-183X-2,2,247.99

What is the cause of this desire, which shews itself in us at all
the different stages of life, from the earliest down to the latest?
HARE-183X-2,2,247.100

What is the origin of this distempered feeling, which stands us in
stead of reason, and which will often lead a man to act against his
plain interest?  HARE-183X-2,2,247.101

The cause is that unreasonable and corrupt selfwill {COM:sic}, which we
have all inherited from Adam, which shews itself differently in different
men, but which in some way or other is sure to shew itself in every one
not thoroughly converted.  HARE-183X-2,2,247.102

Having thus found out the cause of the disorder, we may more easily see
how it is to be cured.  HARE-183X-2,2,247.103

We must get rid of that cause: HARE-183X-2,2,247.104

we must root out that selfwill, which is the source of the whole evil.
HARE-183X-2,2,247.105

We must take God's will for our rule and guide, HARE-183X-2,2,247.106

and must endeavour by all the means in our power, by prayer, by
meditation, by selfdenial {COM:sic}, to bring our own will first
into complete obedience to God's, and then to make it one with God's.
HARE-183X-2,2,247.107

We must <P_2,248> learn to look upon our own wills as impious
and rebellious, because they set themselves in opposition to God.
HARE-183X-2,2,248.108

We must learn to look upon them as mad, because they set themselves in
opposition to reason.  HARE-183X-2,2,248.109

We must learn to look upon them as tyrants, because they govern us
absolutely, without law, and against law.  HARE-183X-2,2,248.110

This mad, rebellious, impious tyranny of the will must not be allowed
to trample on us any longer.  HARE-183X-2,2,248.111

It must be overthrown: which can only be done by setting up God's will
in its place.  HARE-183X-2,2,248.112

Accordingly this is the very remedy which Jesus Christ has pointed out
to us, by teaching us to pray to our heavenly Father that his will,
and not ours, may be done: HARE-183X-2,2,248.113

Remember then, when you are making this petition to God, you are in fact
asking him to cure the great disorder of your nature, and to remedy the
evil brought upon you by Adam's fall.  HARE-183X-2,2,248.114

By that fall our wills were cut off from God's; HARE-183X-2,2,248.115

and the evil and mischief can never be done away, until they are joined
to God's will again.  HARE-183X-2,2,248.116

I said a while ago that the doing God's will includes obedience,
and submission, and patience, and several other Christian graces.
HARE-183X-2,2,248.117

At first perhaps, when we say, Thy will be done, we think only of
that portion of God's will which is to be done by us, such as keeping
his commandments, and doing our duty toward him, and toward <P_2,249>
our neighbour.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.118

But there is another portion of God's will, which must also be taken
into account.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.119

I mean that portion of it which is done toward us, and which exercises
our patience and our faith, as that portion of it which is to be done
by us, exercises our obedience and activity.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.120

Most of us are ready to acknowledge, when any extraordinary
affliction or unforeseen accident befalls us, that it comes from God.
HARE-183X-2,2,249.121

In seasons of sorrow, or of grievous sickness, nothing is commoner than
to hear the sufferer say,"It is the will of God, HARE-183X-2,2,249.122

and I must bow to it. "HARE-183X-2,2,249.123

Now though this is good and right, as far as it goes, it does not go
far enough.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.124

It is like the fault of the Syrians, who said,"Jehovah is God of the
hills; HARE-183X-2,2,249.125

but he is not God of the vallies"<paren> 1 Kings xx. 28 <$$paren>.
HARE-183X-2,2,249.126

So we are apt to speak and think of the Lord our God, as if he were God
only of death, and sickness, and the greater visitations or escapes of
life, but not God of the daily wants and common business of our calling.
HARE-183X-2,2,249.127

The Lord is God of the small things, just as truly as he is God of the
great things.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.128

He orders and appoints and controlls {COM:sic} them all, as seems to
him most fitting.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.129

If we were duly aware of this, we should recognize the voice of God,
and see his hand, in our calling and station.  HARE-183X-2,2,249.130

Therefore, instead of wishing to be something different from what we
are, we should be satisfied that he has <P_2,250> placed us all in the
stations best suited to our characters.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.131

We, my friends, live here away from the world, and in comparative
obscurity.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.132

Shall we repine thereat?  HARE-183X-2,2,250.133

No: it was God who set us here.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.134

Let us feel grateful to him for having sheltered us from the cares and
temptations of more exposed spots, and be careful to make our light
shine in a dark place.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.135

Others are raised to eminence, or born to live amid the bustle of
the world.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.136

Shall they say within themselves,"We could serve God better somewhere
else, with fewer cares to distract us, and fewer temptations to assail
us? "HARE-183X-2,2,250.137

No: they too must recollect that they are set to be lights upon a hill,
by the same hand which has set us in the valley.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.138

They $can $not {TEXT:cannot} change, they ought not to wish to
change their station, any more than we ought to wish to change ours.
HARE-183X-2,2,250.139

Let each endeavour to do God's will, by filling his own station,
if it be lowly, with contentment, if it be lofty, with humility:
HARE-183X-2,2,250.140

and the higher they are placed, the more careful let them be to make
their light so shine before men, that they may see their good works,
and glorify their Father which is in heaven.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.141

Thus have I set before you the duty of sacrificing our wills to the
will of God, not merely by doing his will, but by suffering his will,
with faith and submission and contentment.  HARE-183X-2,2,250.142

It only remains <P_2,251> for me to speak to you of the measure and
degree in which God's will ought to be done by us, - namely, as it is
done in heaven.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.143

The measure which Christ lays down for us is always an infinite measure
, HARE-183X-2,2,251.144

and the pattern is always a heavenly pattern.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.145

As Moses was commanded to make the tabernacle for the children of Israel
in all things according to the pattern shewn to him in the mount,
so we too are to frame the tabernacle of our Christian life, and all
things belonging thereto, according to the perfect model of heaven.
HARE-183X-2,2,251.146

We are to pray, and to strive, that God's will may be done on earth as it
is done in heaven.  That is, we are to do it, as the angels do it, wholly,
readily, cheerfully, and out of the love of God.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.147

We are to do it wholly; HARE-183X-2,2,251.148

for who can fancy an angel leaving any part of his errand unperformed?
HARE-183X-2,2,251.149

We are to do it readily; HARE-183X-2,2,251.150

for they are winged messengers, HARE-183X-2,2,251.151

and run swift as thought to do God's bidding.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.152

We are to do it cheerfully, and with the hearts of angels, which are
the abodes of joy and gladness.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.153

The mere doing God's will is little.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.154

The devils themselves, we may be sure, will be constrained to go as far
as that.  HARE-183X-2,2,251.155

Only, while the angels do it with joy, and find all their happiness in
doing it, the evil spirits do it unwillingly, HARE-183X-2,2,251.156

and would fain shake it off if they could.  So that, unless we bring our
hearts to do God's will cheerfully, we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <P_2,252>
be said to do it as the angels do it, we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be said
to do it as it is done in heaven.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.157

Above all we must do it out of the love of God, for his glory, and not
for our own.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.158

Glory to God in the highest, was the song of the angels at our Saviour's
birth.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.159

The glory of God then is their great object; HARE-183X-2,2,252.160

the love of God is their chief motive.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.161

It is only by the union of love with duty, that the will of God can
be done as it is in heaven, where he rules in the sight of all,
and issues his commands as it seems good to his eternal wisdom.
HARE-183X-2,2,252.162

The angels leave their places before the sapphire throne at God's bidding.
HARE-183X-2,2,252.163

They are his servants, HARE-183X-2,2,252.164

and run to and fro whithersoever he sends them: HARE-183X-2,2,252.165

and they go joyfully, deeming it a blessing to be charged with the least
of his commands.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.166

Have we anything of this feeling about us?  HARE-183X-2,2,252.167

Do not say that it is above the measure of earth, that flesh and blood
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} know it.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.168

Many a good soldier has felt in this manner toward a great and beloved
commander: HARE-183X-2,2,252.169

many a loyal subject has so felt toward his king.  HARE-183X-2,2,252.170

And is not God our king?  HARE-183X-2,2,252.171

Is not the Captain of our salvation our commander?  HARE-183X-2,2,252.172

Let us feel toward him as his subjects and soldiers, happy to be employed
by him, ready to obey him, active in his service, but at the same time
prepared to endure hardships, to stand still at our post, to bear the
taunts and reproaches of the enemy, whenever he <P_2,253> orders us to
do so.  HARE-183X-2,2,253.173

I once read a story of a great captain, who after a battle was talking
over the events of the day with his officers.  HARE-183X-2,2,253.174

He asked them, who had done best that day?  HARE-183X-2,2,253.175

Some mentioned one man who had fought very bravely, some another.
HARE-183X-2,2,253.176

"No <paren> said he <$$paren> you are all mistaken: HARE-183X-2,2,253.177

the best man in the field to-day was a soldier, who had his arm lifted
up against an enemy, but who, on hearing the trumpet sound a retreat
, checked himself, and dropt his arm without striking the blow.
HARE-183X-2,2,253.178

That perfect and ready obedience to the will of his general is the
noblest thing that has been done to-day. "HARE-183X-2,2,253.179

Think over this story, my brethren; endeavour to obey God in all things ,
as that soldier obeyed his general; and you will find out in time what
our Saviour meant by commanding us to pray that God's will may be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.  HARE-183X-2,2,253.180

He meant what he himself did.  HARE-183X-2,2,253.181

For, as by coming down from his glory to take our nature upon him, he
shewed how earth might be lifted up into heaven, so by his activity
in doing, and by his meekness in suffering God's will, he shewed
how his Father's will might be done on earth as it is in heaven.
HARE-183X-2,2,253.182

Look at his diligence in doing that will, which was so great that he
had not time so much as to eat: HARE-183X-2,2,253.183

look at his devotion to it, which <P_2,254> made the doing it meat and
drink to him: HARE-183X-2,2,254.184

think how careful he was to set forth and exalt, not his own glory,
but the glory of him that sent him: HARE-183X-2,2,254.185

call to mind the lowliness and patience, and the readiness to suffer as
well as to do his Father's will, which he shewed throughout his blessed
passion, so that even in the moment of that fearful agony the only cry
that burst from his troubled spirit was,"Father, not my will, but thine
be done! "HARE-183X-2,2,254.186

Such was the example he left us, that we might walk in his steps, both
in our doing and in our praying.  HARE-183X-2,2,254.187

Remember therefore, that when you pray to God that his will may be done,
you pray the very prayer which our Lord prayed.  HARE-183X-2,2,254.188

Remember that, when you pray that it may be done on earth as it is done
in heaven, you are in fact praying that you may be enabled to do it as
perfectly as Jesus Christ did: HARE-183X-2,2,254.189

for he came down from heaven.  HARE-183X-2,2,254.190

Take him for your model; and, as he came down to shew you how God's will
should be done, so will the Holy Ghost come down, if you pray for him,
and enable you to do it.  HARE-183X-2,2,254.191

So long as your lives are continued to you, God will be with you on
earth; HARE-183X-2,2,254.192

and death itself will not separate you.  HARE-183X-2,2,254.193

Rather will it unite you to the Godhead by new and closer bonds.
HARE-183X-2,2,254.194

For Christ will then lift you up, and take you to himself, that, where he
is, you may be also, beholding his glory, partaking in his <P_2,255> joys,
and continuing to do the work which you began on earth , continuing to
do God's will, but without the hinderance {COM:sic} and alloy of human
weakness and earthly imperfections, in the eternal peace of heaven.
HARE-183X-2,2,255.195

Sermon XVI.  HARE-183X-2,2,276.198

Lord's Prayer: Sixth Part.  HARE-183X-2,2,276.199

Forgiveness.  HARE-183X-2,2,276.200

Luke xi. 4.  HARE-183X-2,2,276.201

And forgive us our sins; HARE-183X-2,2,276.202

for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.
HARE-183X-2,2,276.203

<$$heading>

I ended my last sermon by reminding you of the comparisons so common in
the Bible, in which our life is likened to a journey and to a warfare;
HARE-183X-2,2,276.205

and I told you, that, in praying to God for our daily bread, we are
in fact praying to him for what is needful in order that we may have
strength to reach the end of our journey, and to fight our way through
all the hindrances that beset us, to the city of our Lord and Saviour.
HARE-183X-2,2,276.206

But suppose a <P_2,277> man to be a wayfarer, HARE-183X-2,2,277.207

whether, a soldier or a traveler, what is the thing which above all
others would encumber and fatigue him on his march?  HARE-183X-2,2,277.208

Assuredly a heavy weight, a great pack or load to carry, would be more
against a man in a long journey than anything else one could mention.
HARE-183X-2,2,277.209

Many of you can lift a sack of wheat, HARE-183X-2,2,277.210

and can carry it some little way.  HARE-183X-2,2,277.211

But think of being condemned to walk from here to Devizes, or rather
from here to Bath, with a sack of wheat on your shoulder every day for
a month together.  HARE-183X-2,2,277.212

How soon would the stoutest man among you break down under such a load!
HARE-183X-2,2,277.213

He might contrive to stagger on a little way: HARE-183X-2,2,277.214

but his strength before long would fail him; HARE-183X-2,2,277.215

and if he did not drop his load, it would crush him.
HARE-183X-2,2,277.216

Now sin, - when a man is in his right senses, when he knows whither he
ought to be going, - is a weight on the soul, HARE-183X-2,2,277.217

and presses it down, just as a weight on the back presses down the body.
HARE-183X-2,2,277.218

Many of you must have read or heard of poor Christian in the Pilgrim's
Progress, how, after he had read a while in a book given him by one,
Evangelist, that is, after he had studied the word of God, he felt a
burthen on his back so heavy that it almost bowed him to the earth.
HARE-183X-2,2,277.219

That burthen is an allegory to express the painful weight of sin, which is
indeed a burthen to awakened conscience, yea, a sore burthen too <P_2,278>
heavy for it to bear.  HARE-183X-2,2,278.220

When thus overweighted with the sense of guilt, how can the christian
warrior march forward?  HARE-183X-2,2,278.221

Nay, under such a load, how can he act the soldier in the field?
HARE-183X-2,2,278.222

A man who fights needs to be nimble and strong, HARE-183X-2,2,278.223

and should have all his limbs free and unshackled.  HARE-183X-2,2,278.224

He must not go into battle tottering under a load: HARE-183X-2,2,278.225

else a slight thrust will push him over, HARE-183X-2,2,278.226

a slip will lay him on the ground.  HARE-183X-2,2,278.227

Therefore our Lord, after teaching us to ask for food, to support us
through the toil of our daily Christian march, and to carry us through
the hardships of our daily Christian warfare, had us ask for the pardon
of our sins; because, unless we are pardoned, we can neither fight nor
march to good purpose.  HARE-183X-2,2,278.228

This is the second petition in that part of the Lord's prayer which we
are now considering, the second petition which our Lord commands us to
offer up for ourselves: HARE-183X-2,2,278.229

"Forgive us our sins; HARE-183X-2,2,278.230

for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. "
HARE-183X-2,2,278.231

While a sense of guilt is lying heavy on a man, I said, he $can
$not {TEXT:cannot}, at least he will not, serve God to good purpose.
HARE-183X-2,2,278.232

He will not move forward on the road to heaven: HARE-183X-2,2,278.233

he will not stand his ground against temptation.  HARE-183X-2,2,278.234

The children of this world indeed tell a different story.
HARE-183X-2,2,278.235

According to them the forgiveness of sins so freely offered to
sinners <P_2,279> in the New Testament only encourages men to sin on.
HARE-183X-2,2,279.236

And so it may some.  HARE-183X-2,2,279.237

There may be, and I fear there are, persons so wretched and so foolish, as
to abuse the blessed doctrine of forgiveness through the blood of Christ,
to the dishonour of God, and their own ruin.  HARE-183X-2,2,279.238

There may be, and I fear there are, persons who think to take
advantage of God's mercy, and put off repenting year after year,
saying to themselves,"We shall have time to repent by and by.
"HARE-183X-2,2,279.239

Thus they go on, until God's judgement falls on them, and death overtakes
them with all their sins unrepented of, and gives them over to judgement
and to hell.  HARE-183X-2,2,279.240

What spirit can such persons be possest by!  HARE-183X-2,2,279.241

Do they fancy that they can cheat God?  HARE-183X-2,2,279.242

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} they hear the voice of Scripture, which
plainly declares that man $can $not {TEXT:cannot} repent at will?
HARE-183X-2,2,279.243

Does not the Bible say plainly to men of this stamp, -" Can the Ethiopian
change his skin, or the leopard his spots?  HARE-183X-2,2,279.244

then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil"<paren>
Jerem. xiii. 23 <$$paren>.  HARE-183X-2,2,279.245

Does not our own experience too shew the truth of this?
HARE-183X-2,2,279.246

Is it not the rarest of all things, to see a man, who has spent his life
in sin and in forgetfulness of God, turn to God in good earnest in his
old age?  HARE-183X-2,2,279.247

You must have known many old people, some, I hope, religious, and some,
I am afraid, irreligious.  HARE-183X-2,2,279.248

Now of those who really and truly died in the fear <P_2,280> and
love of God, after spending their latter days in his service, how
many were converted and began to turn to God after they became old?
HARE-183X-2,2,280.249

Do you know three such?  HARE-183X-2,2,280.250

If you do, you know a great number.  HARE-183X-2,2,280.251

But I feel almost certain you can none of you recollect so much as three
old persons, who died a godly death, after having lived ungodly till
they grew old.  HARE-183X-2,2,280.252

If this be so, is it not a folly and a madness deserving stripes, -
HARE-183X-2,2,280.253

alas!  what has a Christian minister to do with stripes!
HARE-183X-2,2,280.254

- let me rather say, deserving our pity and our prayers,
HARE-183X-2,2,280.255

- is it not a sad, pitiable folly, brethren, for a man to stake his
soul on this desperate chance of a late repentance, after a life of sin
and ungodliness?  HARE-183X-2,2,280.256

But, though the doctrine of free forgiveness to all who sue to God for
mercy through the blood of Christ may be thus perverted, and abused,
it is still a blessed and a holy doctrine, HARE-183X-2,2,280.257

and is well fitted to make men holy.  HARE-183X-2,2,280.258

Were men no better than beasts or devils, it might encourage them to sin.
HARE-183X-2,2,280.259

But considering what the true nature of man is, - that he has a conscience
to be aroused, and feelings to be touched, and affections to be won,
- this doctrine of forgiveness ought to lead him, and does lead many,
to God.  HARE-183X-2,2,280.260

Nothing can be more certain than that sin cuts man off from God, and
raises a bar which keeps him away.  HARE-183X-2,2,280.261

The Scripture compares it to a chain, which binds a man <P_2,281> and
holds him prisoner.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.262

Would you set the man free?  HARE-183X-2,2,281.263

You must break the chain: HARE-183X-2,2,281.264

and that can only be done by forgiveness.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.265

If you ask me how sin is a chain, I answer, it is like a chain, because
it hangs about a man, and clogs him and hinders him from seeking God.
HARE-183X-2,2,281.266

None of us like to go to a person, to whom we know we have given just
cause of offense.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.267

The sight of such a person is irksome to us: HARE-183X-2,2,281.268

we feel awkward and ill at ease in his company; HARE-183X-2,2,281.269

we stay away from him as much as we can: HARE-183X-2,2,281.270

if we are forced to go to him, we feel it a relief to get away again.
HARE-183X-2,2,281.271

So it is between man and man: HARE-183X-2,2,281.272

so too is it between man and God.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.273

While we believe God to be offended with us, while our consciences tell
us that we are at variance with him, we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be at
ease in his presence.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.274

We dare not think of him; HARE-183X-2,2,281.275

we dare not pray to him; HARE-183X-2,2,281.276

we get away from him as far as we can.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.277

This is no new effect of sin: HARE-183X-2,2,281.278

it has been so from the beginning.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.279

After Adam and Eve had committed the first sin, by eating the forbidden
fruit, we read, that they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in
the garden.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.280

Now mark what follows: HARE-183X-2,2,281.281

And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God
amongst the trees of the garden.  HARE-183X-2,2,281.282

And the Lord God called to Adam, HARE-183X-2,2,281.283

and said to him, Where art thou?  HARE-183X-2,2,281.284

And Adam said, {TEXT:missing_open_quote} I heard thy voice in the garden
, HARE-183X-2,2,281.285

and I was afraid, <P_2,282> because I was naked; HARE-183X-2,2,282.286

and I hid myself. "HARE-183X-2,2,282.287

Naked he was indeed, with the worst of nakedness: HARE-183X-2,2,282.288

his soul was naked: HARE-183X-2,2,282.289

it was lying bare and open with the black stain of sin upon it;
HARE-183X-2,2,282.290

and Adam felt that it was so.  HARE-183X-2,2,282.291

This was the nakedness he was afraid of.  HARE-183X-2,2,282.292

He could not bear to feel the eye of God looking on that black spot;
HARE-183X-2,2,282.293

so he went HARE-183X-2,2,282.294

and hid himself.  HARE-183X-2,2,282.295

And do not sinners in the present day just the same?
HARE-183X-2,2,282.296

Do they not try to hide themselves from God in business, in pleasure,
in revelings, in idle company?  HARE-183X-2,2,282.297

Do they not try all means in their power to fly from their own thoughts,
and from their own conscience?  HARE-183X-2,2,282.298

Do they not hate and dread serious self-examination above all things?
because they know that in such moments God causes his presence to
be felt; and they are afraid to feel that God is looking on them.
HARE-183X-2,2,282.299

They $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear to tear the rag off from their festering
sins: HARE-183X-2,2,282.300

they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear the torture of probing their hearts:
HARE-183X-2,2,282.301

they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} abide the shame of seeing and knowing how
bad their condition is.  HARE-183X-2,2,282.302

So they turn away from all serious thoughts of God in private, and from
all serious talk about him with their neighbours.  HARE-183X-2,2,282.303

They shun all self-examination, HARE-183X-2,2,282.304

and shut their eyes to their danger, with the desperate cowardice of
a ruined man, who will not face a creditor, nor look into a bill, nor
cast up an account-book.  HARE-183X-2,2,282.305

How must this end?  HARE-183X-2,2,282.306

How <P_2,283> does it always end with those who dare not face their
earthly creditors?  HARE-183X-2,2,283.307

Common sense and experience tell us: sooner or later in utter ruin.
HARE-183X-2,2,283.308

How then must such a course end with those who have God Almighty for
their creditor?  HARE-183X-2,2,283.309

Reason and conscience unite to tell us: sooner or later in utter ruin.
HARE-183X-2,2,283.310

The man who will not look into the state of his affairs in this world,
must be ruined in this world: HARE-183X-2,2,283.311

the man who will not look into the state of his soul, must be ruined
for ever.  HARE-183X-2,2,283.312

Here are two sad truths plainly made out, that the consciousness of being
sinners keeps men away from God, and that, in keeping away from God;
we keep away from happiness; HARE-183X-2,2,283.313

in turning from him, we rush into ruin.  HARE-183X-2,2,283.314

How was this evil to be remedied?  HARE-183X-2,2,283.315

Looking at it with the eyes of a man, one should have said, there was
no way.  HARE-183X-2,2,283.316

For the more men became sinners, the more need they had of God:
HARE-183X-2,2,283.317

yet the more they became sinners, the more afraid they were of coming
to him.  HARE-183X-2,2,283.318

But God seeth not as man seeth: HARE-183X-2,2,283.319

in the depths of his merciful wisdom he discovered a remedy for the evil.
HARE-183X-2,2,283.320

That remedy in one word is forgiveness.  HARE-183X-2,2,283.321

He has come to us in the person of his Son, HARE-183X-2,2,283.322

and has called to us in the midst of our sinful courses, saying, "Why
will ye die?  HARE-183X-2,2,283.323

I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth.  HARE-183X-2,2,283.324

Only turn to me, and ye shall live. "HARE-183X-2,2,283.325

Return to the Lord, and he <P_2,284> will have mercy upon you;
HARE-183X-2,2,284.326

return to our God, for he will abundantly pardon you.
HARE-183X-2,2,284.327

This is the plan which our Father has devised for melting the stubborn
naughtiness of men's hearts.  HARE-183X-2,2,284.328

He has begun with offering them forgiveness.  HARE-183X-2,2,284.329

It is easy to see how that one offer wholly changes the state of the
question.  HARE-183X-2,2,284.330

A God who offers us forgiveness is no longer a terrible God, whom we
need be afraid to look upon.  HARE-183X-2,2,284.331

He comes to us in a character of mercy, bringing hopeful gifts.
HARE-183X-2,2,284.332

Nay, he comes to us in a human form, like one of ourselves, that
we may be less frightened at him, and readier to listen to him.
HARE-183X-2,2,284.333

Above all, he comes to us as a suffering man, to move our pity, as a
man suffering undeservedly for our sakes, to awaken our gratitude and
love; that so all the gates of our hearts may be thrown open to him,
and that he may enter and take possession of them the more easily.
HARE-183X-2,2,284.334

Was I wrong then in saying that the offer of free forgiveness through
Christ ought to lead sinners to God?  HARE-183X-2,2,284.335

So it does lead those who have sense enough to feel that they are sinners.
HARE-183X-2,2,284.336

He who is labouring and fainting under the burthen of his sins will creep
to the cross of Christ to be rid of his burthen.  HARE-183X-2,2,284.337

But he who does not feel the lump of sin to be a deformity and a disgrace
to him, he who does not desire to run the race set before him , and
therefore does not feel the weight of those <P_2,285> offenses, which make
him crawl, instead of running - these men of course will not be anxious
to be freed from a burthen which they do not feel: HARE-183X-2,2,285.338

they will not be anxious for God's forgiveness; because they are not
aware that they need it.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.339

The first lesson for us all to learn then is the evil and wickedness
of sin.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.340

We must get a sense of our own unworthiness and guiltiness in the sight
of God.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.341

Now this can only be done by a diligent study of the Bible, especially
of the New Testament.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.342

Everything in the world about us is fitted to stupefy us, and to blind
us to the true nature of sin.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.343

In the world it wears a mask and a disguise.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.344

But in God's book it appears without a mask: HARE-183X-2,2,285.345

we may see it there in all its hideousness.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.346

It is spoken of there, as they speak of it in heaven, and as Christ will
speak of it when he casts it into hell.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.347

Therefore it is only by a diligent study of the New Testament and of
other godly books, that a man can gain a right sense of his guiltiness
in the sight of God.  HARE-183X-2,2,285.348

But you must read with both your eyes open, HARE-183X-2,2,285.349

and must listen with both your ears open: HARE-183X-2,2,285.350

and one eye must be turned inward on your own soul; HARE-183X-2,2,285.351

one ear must be opened inward to the whispers of your conscience.
HARE-183X-2,2,285.352

When you meet with any of those awful threats, which are scattered through
Scripture against every kind of sin, you must not say to yourselves,"That
does not <P_2,286> apply to me.  "HARE-183X-2,2,286.353

Your first thought should be rather. "It does apply to me, and was set
there to give me warning. "HARE-183X-2,2,286.354

The effect of sin, we have seen, is to frighten us away from God, to
make us hide ourselves from him, as Adam and Eve hid themselves from
him, to make us fly away from him, as Jonah fled from the presence of
the Lord to Tarshish.  HARE-183X-2,2,286.355

Thus has it been more or less with all such as have had to struggle and
to squeeze through the narrow gate which separates the ways of death
and life.  HARE-183X-2,2,286.356

Everyone, with the exception of the few who have had the happiness to
enter the kingdom of heaven as little children, and to abide therein, -
every one who has allowed the burthen of unrepented sin to grow upon him
, must have felt at the outset of his Christian march how that burthen
encumbered him and pressed him down: HARE-183X-2,2,286.357

he must have felt too that, had it not been for the hope of being
delivered from his burthen sooner or later, he should never have had
the courage to persevere.  HARE-183X-2,2,286.358

It is hope, the hope of being forgiven for Christ's sake, the hope,
if we turn to God, of being received mercifully, as the prodigal son
was received by his forgiving father, - it is this firm hope that
bears a man up through the dark and dreary season of repentance.
HARE-183X-2,2,286.359

For repentance, true repentance, is oftentimes a dark and stormy season.
HARE-183X-2,2,286.360

Were it <P_2,287> not for the unfailing promises of Christ, which, like
the rainbow in the clouds, are a sure sign to the sinner that his trials
shall have an end, and that the flood of his sorrows and iniquities shall
not swell so as to drown his soul, - were it not for those comfortable
promises which Jesus Christ in his Gospel makes to all such as will
truly turn to him, many a sinner's heart would fail: HARE-183X-2,2,287.361

he would say within himself,"This repentance is too painful for me;
HARE-183X-2,2,287.362

I will go back to my former sins. "HARE-183X-2,2,287.363

Not that the service of sin is easy and pleasant, least of all to the
awakened sinner.  HARE-183X-2,2,287.364

On the contrary, no sooner does he return to it, than his bondage galls
and frets him.  HARE-183X-2,2,287.365

But as a man in a fever tosses and turns about from side to side, seeking
rest for his body, and finding none, so would it be with the awakened
sinner, were he not supported by hope during the trial and struggle of
his change.  HARE-183X-2,2,287.366

The terrors of the Lord would frighten him into repentance;
HARE-183X-2,2,287.367

and then the weakness of repentance would carry him back to sin.
HARE-183X-2,2,287.368

So the poor wretch would be driven backward and forward, never resting,
yet never getting on.  HARE-183X-2,2,287.369

This is even now the state of many, in spite of God's promises:
HARE-183X-2,2,287.370

and it would be the state of all, if Christ had not saved us from it.
HARE-183X-2,2,287.371

But his promises and invitations are so clear and gracious, that many
a poor soul is encouraged by them to persevere <P_2,288> in the work of
repentance, painful as it may be: until at length God causes his mercy
to shine forth on him, like a sunbeam from a stormy cloud, and speaks
peace to his wounded spirit: HARE-183X-2,2,288.372

and so the sinner knows himself to be forgiven, HARE-183X-2,2,288.373

and hastens on his way rejoicing.  HARE-183X-2,2,288.374

In a word, as it happened to the paralytic man, so does it happen to us.
HARE-183X-2,2,288.375

When Christ had said to him,"Thy sins are forgiven thee; arise and
walk,"he arose, HARE-183X-2,2,288.376

and took up his bed, HARE-183X-2,2,288.377

and went to his home.  HARE-183X-2,2,288.378

Thus we too are naturally palsied and lame and halt with sin:
HARE-183X-2,2,288.379

but when Jesus says to us,"Repent, and your sins shall be forgiven,
"we too are strengthened and encouraged to arise and walk in the paths
of righteousness.  HARE-183X-2,2,288.380

We leave our burthen of sin behind us, HARE-183X-2,2,288.381

and take up our bed, HARE-183X-2,2,288.382

and carry it along with us: that is, in our duty we find our rest.
HARE-183X-2,2,288.383

Let none of you say within himself,"This is all very well for gross and
open sinners; HARE-183X-2,2,288.384

but it does not apply to decent, well-behaved persons, such as I am.
"HARE-183X-2,2,288.385

Remember that a man may sleep upon his burthen, instead of carrying it ;
HARE-183X-2,2,288.386

and then to be sure he does not feel it.  HARE-183X-2,2,288.387

Yes, he may so sleep, HARE-183X-2,2,288.388

and may even dream that he is moving onward: HARE-183X-2,2,288.389

but he who moves only in a dream, will not make much way.
HARE-183X-2,2,288.390

Besides his dream must come to an end: HARE-183X-2,2,288.391

he must awake at last.  HARE-183X-2,2,288.392

Does not St John tell us, that"if a man says he has no <P_2,289> sin,
he deceives himself, HARE-183X-2,2,289.393

and the truth is not in him? "HARE-183X-2,2,289.394

Does not St James say,"In many things we all offend? "
HARE-183X-2,2,289.395

Surely these texts are plain enough.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.396

He who has never felt the burthen of his sins, and his need of pardon,
will do well to ponder and consider them.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.397

Want of feeling is no proof of life and health, but the contrary.
HARE-183X-2,2,289.398

If one of my hands were benumbed, and had lost all feeling, I should
know something ailed it.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.399

Were I speaking of it to a neighbour, I should probably say,"My hand is
just as if it were dead. "HARE-183X-2,2,289.400

Now this is the very way the Bible speaks of those whose souls are not
awake to the evil of their nature: HARE-183X-2,2,289.401

it says of them, that they are"<font> dead <$$font> in trespasses and
sins. "HARE-183X-2,2,289.402

Be not deceived in this matter.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.403

Do not mistake a palsied conscience for a healthy one, a dead soul for
a live one: HARE-183X-2,2,289.404

do not fancy that, because you feel nothing, you have therefore no
burthen on your backs.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.405

Rather let your fears be aroused by this very thing, that you do feel
nothing.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.406

It is a symptom quite dangerous enough to call for all your watchfulness.
HARE-183X-2,2,289.407

Set the looking-glass of Scripture right before you, HARE-183X-2,2,289.408

and look yourselves well over therein.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.409

To that scriptural self-examination join diligent and hearty prayer.
HARE-183X-2,2,289.410

Pray to God to deliver you from the fumes of self-conceit, which prevent
your seeing yourselves clearly.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.411

Pray to him to shew you your sins.  HARE-183X-2,2,289.412

You will <P_2,290> find an excellent prayer for that purpose in the
last verses of the 139th Psalm, which you may use with a very slight
alteration: HARE-183X-2,2,290.413

"Search me, O God, that I may know my heart: HARE-183X-2,2,290.414

try me, that I may know my thoughts.  HARE-183X-2,2,290.415

Shew me if there be any way of wickedness in me: HARE-183X-2,2,290.416

and lead me in the way everlasting. "HARE-183X-2,2,290.417

Thus would I have you endeavour to quicken your consciences, that your
sense of your misdeeds may carry you with double eagerness to your
Saviour , - and that, feeling all the weight and burthen of your sins,
you may long the more to be freed from it, and may thus perceive how
gracious the Lord is, in commanding us, when we pray, to say, Forgive
us our sins: because, unless we had the hope of obtaining forgiveness,
we could never draw nigh to God.  HARE-183X-2,2,290.418

But it is not simple forgiveness, that our Lord has here taught us to
ask for.  HARE-183X-2,2,290.419

He has been pleased to join a condition to this prayer; so that,
every time we repeat the prayer for forgiveness, we are to repeat the
condition also.  HARE-183X-2,2,290.420

We are not to say,"Forgive us our sins,"without adding,"For we too
forgive every one that is indebted to us. "HARE-183X-2,2,290.421

These are the words as they stand in St Luke: HARE-183X-2,2,290.422

you are all aware that they are not exactly the same as those you are
in the habit of using.  HARE-183X-2,2,290.423

You have been taught to say,"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
them that trespass against us. "HARE-183X-2,2,290.424

<P_2,291>

In the text we read,"Forgive us our sins; HARE-183X-2,2,291.426

for we too forgive every one that is indebted to us:"while in St
Matthew it stands thus,"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors. "HARE-183X-2,2,291.427

These little differences may serve to shew you how unimportant the words
are in comparison with the meaning and the spirit.  HARE-183X-2,2,291.428

Whether we say trespasses, or whether we say sins, or whether we say
debts, the meaning is just the same: HARE-183X-2,2,291.429

and the meaning is what really signifies.  HARE-183X-2,2,291.430

Perhaps it was to keep us in mind of this, and to prevent our making an
idol of the words of his prayer, and using them as a spell or a charm,
without giving heed to their meaning, - that our Saviour varied those
words, and said,"Forgive us our debts,"when he taught the people in his
Sermon on the Mount, and Forgive us our sins,"when he taught them the
second time in St Luke.  HARE-183X-2,2,291.431

Our prayer, as it stands in the Prayerbook, is probably taken from the
old version of the Lord's prayer, used in early ages in this country.
HARE-183X-2,2,291.432

Now surely if any rule, if any motive could keep us all in peace and
love with each other, it would be that in our daily prayers we are to
declare to God, that we have forgiven every one who has offended us,
and that we only ask for mercy ourselves, in proportion as we shew mercy
to others: HARE-183X-2,2,291.433

Forgive us, as we forgive them.  HARE-183X-2,2,291.434

Shall <P_2,292> we dare then to come before the God of truth, the God
who knoweth all things, who sees into our hearts, and reads our very
thoughts, HARE-183X-2,2,292.435

- shall we dare come before such a God with a falsehood in our mouths?
HARE-183X-2,2,292.436

Shall we lie to God in our prayers?  HARE-183X-2,2,292.437

Who can be bold enough to do this?  HARE-183X-2,2,292.438

Yet, unless we do it, we must either give over asking for pardon,
HARE-183X-2,2,292.439

and must depart altogether from God, and be content to remain under his
wrath, HARE-183X-2,2,292.440

or we must ourselves clean forgive every one who has offended us.
HARE-183X-2,2,292.441

Conceive a revengeful, unforgiving man repeating this prayer, which you
all, I hope, repeat daily, HARE-183X-2,2,292.442

- conceive a man with a heart full of wrath against his neighbour,
with a memory which treasures up the little wrongs and insults and
provocations he fancies himself to have received from that neighbour,
HARE-183X-2,2,292.443

- conceive such a man praying to God most High, to forgive him his
trespasses, as he forgives the man who has trespast against him.
HARE-183X-2,2,292.444

What in the mouth of such a man do these words mean?
HARE-183X-2,2,292.445

They mean...  HARE-183X-2,2,292.446

but that you may more fully understand their meaning, I will turn them
into a prayer, which we will call the prayer of the unforgiving man:
HARE-183X-2,2,292.447

"O God, I have sinned against thee many times, from my youth up until now.
HARE-183X-2,2,292.448

I have often been forgetful of thy goodness: HARE-183X-2,2,292.449

I have not duly thanked thee for thy mercies: HARE-183X-2,2,292.450

I have neglected thy service: HARE-183X-2,2,292.451

I have broken thy <P_2,293> laws: HARE-183X-2,2,293.452

I have done many things utterly wrong against thee.  HARE-183X-2,2,293.453

All this I know: HARE-183X-2,2,293.454

and beside this doubtless I have committed many secret sins, which in
my blindness I have failed to notice.  HARE-183X-2,2,293.455

Such is my guiltiness, O Lord, in thy sight: HARE-183X-2,2,293.456

deal with me, I beseech thee, even as I deal with my neighbour.
HARE-183X-2,2,293.457

He has not offended me one-tenth, one-hundredth part as much as I have
offended thee: HARE-183X-2,2,293.458

but he has offended me very grievously; HARE-183X-2,2,293.459

and I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forgive him.  HARE-183X-2,2,293.460

Deal with me, I beseech thee, O Lord, as I deal with him.
HARE-183X-2,2,293.461

He has been very ungrateful to me, - though not a tenth, not a hundredth
part as ungrateful as I have been to thee: HARE-183X-2,2,293.462

yet I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} overlook such base and shameful ingratitude.
HARE-183X-2,2,293.463

Deal with me, I beseech thee, O Lord, as I deal with him.
HARE-183X-2,2,293.464

I remember and treasure up every little trifle, which shews how ill he
has behaved to me.  HARE-183X-2,2,293.465

Deal with me, I beseech thee, O Lord, as I deal with him.
HARE-183X-2,2,293.466

I am determined to take the very first opportunity of doing him an
ill turn.  HARE-183X-2,2,293.467

Deal with me, I beseech thee, O Lord, as I deal with him. "
HARE-183X-2,2,293.468

Can anything be more shocking and horrible than such a prayer?
HARE-183X-2,2,293.469

Is not the very sound of it enough to make one's blood run cold?
HARE-183X-2,2,293.470

Yet this is just the prayer which the unforgiving man offers up every
time he repeats the Lord's prayer.  HARE-183X-2,2,293.471

For he prays to God to forgive him in the same <P_2,294> manner in which
he forgives his neighbour.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.472

But he does not forgive his neighbour: HARE-183X-2,2,294.473

so he prays to God not to forgive him.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.474

God grant that his prayer may not be heard!  HARE-183X-2,2,294.475

For he is praying a curse on his own head.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.476

Such is the wisdom of the way, such the strength of the motive, by which
our Lord has endeavoured to establish peace and goodwill among his people.
HARE-183X-2,2,294.477

He has taught us that we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be forgiven, unless we
on our part forgive all our brethren.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.478

Thus he has bound heavenly peace and earthly peace together by the golden
chain of prayer.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.479

We $can $not {TEXT:cannot} have, we are not even to ask for heavenly
peace, for peace with God, unless our hearts bear us witness that we
have done our utmost to keep at peace with every man, yea, even with
those who have ill used us, with those who have spoken evil of us, with
those who have borne themselves proudly toward us, or have affronted
and insulted us, or have done us any sort of wrong.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.480

Perhaps however you will ask me, what is meant by this forgiveness?
HARE-183X-2,2,294.481

how are we to forgive our brethren?  HARE-183X-2,2,294.482

The answer is plain enough: even as we wish to be forgiven by God.
HARE-183X-2,2,294.483

The same kind of forgiveness, the same degree of forgiveness, which you
desire of God, are you to shew to each other.  HARE-183X-2,2,294.484

What that is, let your own hearts <P_2,295> tell you,
HARE-183X-2,2,295.485

your fears of hell, into which God might justly cast you for your sins,
your hopes of heaven, which God for his Son's sake will throw open to
the penitent and forgiving: let these tell you how you ought to forgive
your neighbour.  HARE-183X-2,2,295.486

Or shall I rather send you to the old saying, which contains as much
mercy and as much wisdom as was ever put by man into three words?
HARE-183X-2,2,295.487

the saying, Forgive and forget.  HARE-183X-2,2,295.488

Forgiving and forgetting is the pardon which we desire from God:
HARE-183X-2,2,295.489

therefore forgiving and forgetting is the pardon which we are to grant
to man.  HARE-183X-2,2,295.490

But some will perhaps say, - at least many have said, - I have heard it
said many times, -"Well, I will forgive; HARE-183X-2,2,295.491

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} forget. "HARE-183X-2,2,295.492

What!  HARE-183X-2,2,295.493

is our memory then better than God's?  HARE-183X-2,2,295.494

For he can forget, and has promised to forget, the sins of his people.
HARE-183X-2,2,295.495

Thus he saith by the prophet Jeremiah <paren> xxxi. 34 <$$paren>:
"I will forgive their iniquity, HARE-183X-2,2,295.496

and I will remember their sin no more. "HARE-183X-2,2,295.497

Shall God say this of our sins, which are so great that they rise up
over our heads?  HARE-183X-2,2,295.498

and shall not we be able to say as much of the petty offenses of our
neighbour?  HARE-183X-2,2,295.499

petty, not in themselves, it may be, yet trifling, insignificant, small
as a little mote, when compared with our great beams and mountains of
sin against God.  HARE-183X-2,2,295.500

But what does God mean, when he says, <P_2,296> he"will remember our
sins no more? "HARE-183X-2,2,296.501

He means, that he will never think of them, and never mention them again.
HARE-183X-2,2,296.502

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} we do as much?  HARE-183X-2,2,296.503

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} we, in looking at our neighbour's behaviour
toward us, look at the better part of it, rather than the worse?
HARE-183X-2,2,296.504

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} we let our thoughts dwell on those points which
make for him, or at least which tend to excuse him, while we turn way from
those parts of his conduct which render his fault uglier and more glaring?
HARE-183X-2,2,296.505

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} we take account of all those matters in our
behaviour to him, which may have seemed to him in any degree harsh, or
unkind, or angry, or disrespectful, or overbearing?  HARE-183X-2,2,296.506

It is not necessary that we should have meant them to be so.
HARE-183X-2,2,296.507

You know how easily mistakes arise, how easily the same thing may be
construed in two different ways.  HARE-183X-2,2,296.508

$Can $not {TEXT:Cannot} we take account of the ill-judged advice of
those false friends, who so often fan the flame of discord, instead of
throwing water on it and extinguishing it?  HARE-183X-2,2,296.509

If we made due allowance for all these things, our neighbour's offenses
would dwindle very much in our eyes: and all these allowances we ought in
mere justice and fairness to make, whenever we think about his conduct.
HARE-183X-2,2,296.510

But the best way is not to think of it at all, still less to speak of
it: HARE-183X-2,2,296.511

for, if we refrain from speaking of it, the remembrance will soon die
away from our minds.  HARE-183X-2,2,296.512

It is <P_2,297> by angry words, that people are wont to swell the fire
of their anger, and to make it burn more fiercely.  HARE-183X-2,2,297.513

Take away the fuel, and in time it will go out.  HARE-183X-2,2,297.514

This, my brethren, is the forgiveness that we must shew to others.
HARE-183X-2,2,297.515

We must not only forgive their offenses against us, HARE-183X-2,2,297.516

but we must forget them.  HARE-183X-2,2,297.517

We must never speak of them: HARE-183X-2,2,297.518

we must try never to think of them: HARE-183X-2,2,297.519

we must look about for what may be said in excuse of them.
HARE-183X-2,2,297.520

Not only must we abstain from rewarding others evil for evil, from
shewing them any unkindness: HARE-183X-2,2,297.521

we must be just as ready to shew them every kindness in our power,
as if they had never offended us.  HARE-183X-2,2,297.522

We must try to overcome them by kindness, to melt their hearts by pouring
benefits upon them.  HARE-183X-2,2,297.523

For this is the forgiveness which we crave from God.
HARE-183X-2,2,297.524

We not only desire that God should forgive us, not only that he should
blot out our offenses, but also that, for the sake of his blessed Son,
he should receive us into favour, and give us the good things of heaven.
HARE-183X-2,2,297.525
