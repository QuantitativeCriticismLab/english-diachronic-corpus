THE EXAMINATION OF VSURIE; IN TWO SERMONS.  SMITH-E2-P2,B1R.3

THE FIRST SERMON.  SMITH-E2-P2,B1R.4

<$$heading>

{COM:verse_omitted}

These two verses must bee considered together, because one is the
question, and the other is the answer: SMITH-E2-P2,B1R.7

<font> Dauid <$$font> demands who shall come to heauen?  SMITH-E2-P2,B1R.8

and God tels him that Vsurers <P_B1V> shall not come thether: as if hee
should say, They shall go to hell.  SMITH-E2-P2,B1V.9

Therefore as <font> Paule <$$font> taught <font> Timothie <$$font> to
warne the~ which are rich, as though they had more neede to be warned
than other: so this sentence seemeth to bee penned for a warning to the
rich, because it strikes vpon the rich mans vice.  SMITH-E2-P2,B1V.10

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_1_here}

<P_C2V>

When God set <font> Adam <$$font> his work, he sayd, <font> In the sweate
of thy browes shalt thou liue: <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.13

not in the sweate of his browes, but in the sweate of thy browes:
SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.14

but the Vsurer liueth in the sweate of his browes, and her browes : that
is, by the paines and cares, and labours of an other, SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.15

for he taketh no paines himselfe, SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.16

but only expecteth the time when his interest will come in, like the belly
which doeth no worke, and yet eateth all the meate.  SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.17

When God had finished his creation, he sayd vnto man, and vnto beastes ,
and vnto foules, and vnto fishes, <font> increase and multiplie, <$$font>
SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.18

but he neuer saide vnto money, increase and multiplie, because it is a
dead thing which hath no seede, and therefore is not fit to ingender.
SMITH-E2-P2,C2V.19

Therefore he which saith to his money, increase and multiplie, <P_C3R>
begetteth a monstrous birth, like <font> Anah <$$font>, which deuised
a creature which God had not created before.  SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.20

Christ saith to his Disciples, <font> If you loue but them which loue you,
what are you better then the Publicans, SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.21

for they loue their brethren: <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.22

so I may say, if you will lend to none but to them which will pay you
Vusurie for it, what are you better tha~ the <font> Iewes <$$font> ,
SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.23

for the <font> Iewes <$$font> would lend for Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.24

and if you be no better than the <font> Iewes <$$font>, then you shall
speede no better than they: SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.25

for as Christ sayde, <font> Except your righteousnes do exceede the
righteousnes of the Pharisies, your reward shall not exceed the rewarde
of the Pharisies <$$font>, SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.26

so, except your charitie do exceede the charitie of the <font> Iewes
<$$font>, your reward shall not exceede the reward of the <font>
Iewes <$$font>.  SMITH-E2-P2,C3R.27

All this doth shewe, that the Vsurer is like <font> Esau <$$font>
, <P_C3V> of whome God sayde, <font> Esau haue I hated.  <$$font>
SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.28

Now in the 112. Psalme, you shall see who is like <font> Iacob
<$$font>, of whome God sayth, <font> Iacob haue I loued: <$$font>
SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.29

for there <font> Dauid <$$font> sayth, <font> a good man is mercifull,
SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.30

and lendeth <$$font>, SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.31

and straight vppon it he setteth this crowne, SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.32

<font> he shall neuer be moued, but be had in perpetuall remembraunce
: <$$font> as if he should say, this is the good mans Vusurie,
SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.33

this is his increase, euen a good name, and euerlasting ioy.
SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.34

Againe in the 23. of Exod. it is said, <font> Lend vnto him
which wanteth without Vsurie, that the Lorde may blesse thee: <$$font>
as if he should say, let the Lord pay the increase, SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.35

feare not to be loosers by doing good, SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.36

for God hath giuen his word to requite it himselfe.  SMITH-E2-P2,C3V.37

As he sayth to them which were afrayd to pay tythes, and offer sacrifice
, <font> Try me if I will not powre down a blessing <P_C4R> vpon you:
<$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.38

so he seemeth to say vnto them which are afrayd to lend, try me if I
will not powre downe a blessing vppon you.  SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.39

Whome will you trust, if you doe not trust your Creator, your Father,
your Redeemer, your Preseruer, and your Sauiour.  SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.40

Now you haue heard the vnlawfulnes of Vsurie, you shall heare how many
kindes there be of it.  SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.41

As other Crafts are called Mysteries, so I may fitly call it, the mysterie
of Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.42

for they haue deuised moe sorts of Vsurie, than there be tricks at Cardes,
SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.43

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} recken halfe, SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.44

and I am afraide to shewe you all, least I should teach you to be Vsurers,
while I disswade you from Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.45

yet I will shew you some, SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.46

and the same reasons which are aledged against these, shall condemne
all the rest.  SMITH-E2-P2,C4R.47

<P_C4V>

Some will not take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C4V.49

but they will haue the vse of your pasture, or your lande, or your
orchard, or your teame, or your kine, vntill you pay the money againe
, which in that time will grow to greater gaine to the Vsurer, and a
greater losse to the borower, than if he had paid more money than other
Vsurers are wont to take.  SMITH-E2-P2,C4V.50

Some will not take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C4V.51

but they will take plate, and vessell, and tapistree, and bedding, and
other houshold stuffe, to vse and weare, vntill their money come home,
which will lose more in the wearing, than the interest of the money
would come to.  SMITH-E2-P2,C4V.52

This Vsurie is forbidden in the 2. of <font> Amos <$$font>,
where God co~plaineth saying, <font> They lye downe vpon the clothes
which are layd to pledge: <$$font> shewing, <P_C5R> that wee should not
lye down vppon such clothes, SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.53

that is, wee should not vse or weare the thing which is layd to pledge.
SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.54

Some will take no Vusrie, SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.55

but they will take a pawne which is better than the money which they
lende, SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.56

and then they will couenant, that if he bring not the money againe
by such a day, he forfitteth his pawne: which day the Vsurer knoweth,
that the poore man is not able to keepe, SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.57

and so kepeth the pawne for his money, which is worth twise his money.
SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.58

This Vsurie is forbidden in <font> Leuit. <$$font> 25.
, where it is said, <font> Thou shalt not take Vsurie or vauntage
<$$font> as if he should say, thou shalt not take the forfeiture;
SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.59

for then thou takest vauntage, when thou takest more than thou lendest.
SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.60

Some will not take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C5R.61

but <P_C5V> they will buy some thing at a smal price, and then couenant
with the borrower that he buy the same againe of the same price at such
a day, which day the Vsurer knoweth that the borrower is not able to
keepe, SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.62

and so hee getteth for a little that which the other might haue solde
for much more.  SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.63

This Vsurie is conde~ned in the 1. <font> Thess. <$$font>
4 where it is said, <font> Let no man defraude or circumuent his brother
in any thing.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.64

Some will not take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.65

but they will lend out their money to occupiers, vpon condition to bee
partakers in their gaines, but not in their losses: SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.66

so one takes all the paines SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.67

and abideth al the venture, SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.68

& the other which takes no pains, reapeth halfe the profite.
SMITH-E2-P2,C5V.69

This Vsurie is forbidden in 2. <font> Thessa. <$$font>
3.10.  where it is saide, <font> He which will <P_C6R> not worke let
him not eate.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.70

Some will not take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.71

but if he bee a Labourer, or a Mason, or a Carpenter, which borroweth of
him, he will couenant with him for so many daies worke, SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.72

he shall labour with him so manie daies, or so many weekes for no money,
but the lone of money.  SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.73

This Vsury is condemned in <font> Luk. <$$font> 10.7.  where
it is said, <font> The labourer is worthie of his hire.  <$$font>
SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.74

Some will not take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.75

but if you haue not present money to pay for their wares, they will set
a high price of them, for the forbearing of the time, SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.76

and so they doo not onely sell their wares, but they sell time too:
SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.77

that is, they doo not onely sell their owne, but they sell Gods owne.
SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.78

Therefore one saith of these, <font> When he selleth the day he selleth
the light, SMITH-E2-P2,C6R.79

and when hee selleth <P_C6V> the night, he selleth rest:
SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.80

therefore when he would haue the light of heauen, and the rest of
Paradise, it shall be said vnto him that he hath solde both alreadie.
SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.81

For he solde light when he sold the day, SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.82

and he solde rest when he sold the night: SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.83

and therefore now he can haue neither light nor rest.  <$$font>
SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.84

There be other Vsurers which will not lend themselues, but giue leaue
to their wiues, SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.85

and they play like hucksters, that is, euerie moneth a penny
for a shilling, which is one hundred for another in the yeare.
SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.86

But that I was informed of the~ since this Sermon was preached, I had left
out our {TEXT:out} capital Vsurers, which will not lend any money, because
they dare not require so much gaine as they would haue: SMITH-E2-P2,C6V.87

but if you would borrow an hundred pounde, they will giue you <P_C7R>
wares worth three score pounde, SMITH-E2-P2,C7R.88

and you shall answer them an hundred pound for it.  SMITH-E2-P2,C7R.89

These are the Vsurers generall which lurke about the Citie like Rats,
and Wesels, and Fulmers, of whom may bee said the same which is said of
the diuels, SMITH-E2-P2,C7R.90

<font> they seeke whom they may deuoure.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,C7R.91

There be other Cosins to Vsurers, which are not counted Vsurers, such
as aske money for that which they should giue freelie: such as take as
much for a counterfeit as for the best: such as take a fee of a Client
and doo him no pleasure: such as take money for Masses, and Dirges,
and Trentalls, and Pardons, and such like drugs, which do no more good
than fire out of the chimney.  SMITH-E2-P2,C7R.92

This is a kind of Vsury and deceit beside, which one day they will
cast away as <font> Iudas <$$font> <P_C7V> did his thirtie pence.
SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.93

Now you haue heard the kinds of Vsurie, you shall heare the arguments
which are deuised for Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.94

Sinne is neuer complet vntill it bee excused: SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.95

this is the vauntage which the deuill getteth by euery sinne,
SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.96

whensoeuer he can fasten any temptation vppon vs, wee giue him a sinne
for it, and an excuse to boote, as <font> Adam <$$font> our father did.
SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.97

First he sinned, SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.98

and then he excused: SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.99

so first we sinne, SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.100

and then we excuse: SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.101

first an Vsurer, SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.102

& then an excuser.  SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.103

Therefore euerie Vsurer will defend Vsurie with his tung, though he
condemne it with his conscience.  SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.104

If the Image makers of <font> Ephesus <$$font> had not liued by
Images, they would haue spoken for Images no more than the rest:
SMITH-E2-P2,C7V.105

for none stood for Images but the Image <P_C8R> makers:
SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.106

so if the Vsurers did not liue by Vsurie, they woulde speak for Vsurie
no more than the rest: SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.107

for none stand for Vsurie but Vsurers.  SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.108

It is an easie matter, if a man be disposed, to speake something for
euerie vice; as some defende the Stewes: some defende Nonresidencie: some
defend swearing by my faith: some defende bowling vppon the Saboath :
and some defend Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.109

But, <font> will you pleade for Baal?  <$$font> <paren> saith <font>
Ioash <$$font> <$$paren> SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.110

that is, will you pleade for sinne which will pleade against you?
SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.111

A sin is a sin when it is defended: SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.112

nay, a sinne is two sins when it is defended: SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.113

for <font> he which breaketh one of the least Commandements <$$font>
<paren> saith Christ <$$paren> and teacheth others to doo so, <font>
is the least in the kingdom of heauen.  <$$paren> SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.114

A Squire of low degree is a Squire of no degree: SMITH-E2-P2,C8R.115

so <P_C8V> the least in the kingdome of heauen is none of the kingdome
of heauen.  SMITH-E2-P2,C8V.116

Who then is the least in the kingdome of heauen?  SMITH-E2-P2,C8V.117

not he which breaketh the least of the Commandements, but he which
teacheth others to doo so: SMITH-E2-P2,C8V.118

that is, he which by defending, and excusing, and minsing, and extenuating
his sinne, incourageth others to sinne too.  SMITH-E2-P2,C8V.119

To defend Vsurie, they distinguish vppon it, as they distinguish of
lying: SMITH-E2-P2,C8V.120

as they say, there is a pernicious lye, and an officious lye, and a merrie
lye, and a godly lye: so they say, there is the Merchants Vsurie, and
the Strangers Vsurie, and the Widdowes Vsurie, and the Orphanes Vsurie,
and the poore mans Vsurie, and the biting Vsurie, and the charitable
Vsurie, and the necessarie Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,C8V.121

<P_D1R>

As God said <font> ye shall die, <$$font> & the woman sayd, <font>
peraduenture ye shall dye <$$font>, and the Serpent said, <font>
ye shall not dye <$$font>; so there be three opinions of Vsurie:
SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.123

some say like God, <font> thou shalt dye <$$font>, SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.124

they thinke that Vsurie is vtterly vnlawfull, because God hath vtterly
forbid it: SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.125

some say like the woman, <font> peraduenture thou shalt dye <$$font>
, SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.126

they doubt whether Vsurie be vtterly vnlawfull or no, because it is so
much tollerated: SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.127

some say like the Serpent, <font> thou shalt not dye <$$font>,
SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.128

they thinke that Vsurie is lawfull, because it is gainefull, as <font>
Saule <$$font> thought that the Idolaters beastes should not be killed
because they were fat.  SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.129

But as he was commaunded to kill the fat beastes, as well as the leane,
so we are commanded to kill fat sinnes as well as leane sinnes; gainefull
sinnes as well as prodigall sinnes.  SMITH-E2-P2,D1R.130

<P_D1V>

They which pleade for Vsurie, obiect these arguments.  SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.132

First they say, God doeth alow some kinde of Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.133

for in <font> Deut. <$$font> 2.3 it is said <font> of a stranger
thou mayest take Vsurie.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.134

I perceiue no scripture speaketh for Vsurers.  SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.135

<font> Of a stranger <$$font> <paren> sayth God <$$paren> <font> thou
mayest take Vsurie: <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.136

but thou takest Vsurie of thy brother, SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.137

therefore this condemneth thee, because thou vsest thy brother like
a stranger.  SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.138

Here <font> stranger <$$font> doth signifie the <font> Iewes <$$font>
enemies, whome they were commaunded to destroy: SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.139

therefore marke how much this maketh against Vsurie, which they obiect
for Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.140

God doeth not license the <font> Iewes <$$font> to take Vsurie of any,
but their enemies whome they might kill: SMITH-E2-P2,D1V.141

They might not be Vsurers vnto any, but to them of whom they might be
destroyers, whome they might <P_D2R> slay, SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.142

of them only they might take Vsurie: shewing that Vsurie is a kind of
punishment, and such a kind of punishment, as if we are to kill a man,
it were a very fit punishment for him, SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.143

and therefore the <font> Iewes <$$font> might take Vsurie of none,
but them whom they might kill.  SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.144

Secondly, they say that they lend for compassion, SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.145

and so make Vsurie a worke of charitie.  SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.146

This were charitie not to be partakers in our gaines, but to be partakers
in our losses, SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.147

but Vsurers will be partakers in our gaines, but not in our losses;
SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.148

nay, though we lose, yet they will gaine: SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.149

is this charitie?  SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.150

it is colde charitie to partake in our gaines, and not in our losses.
SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.151

Thirdly, they say, if he gaine and I gaine too, is not this well,
SMITH-E2-P2,D2R.152

may he not consider my friendship <P_D2V> and be thankefull?
SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.153

yes, hee may be thankfull, SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.154

but no man is bound to be thankfull, SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.155

but when he hath receiued a good turne, then he is tried whether he wil
be thankfull or no: SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.156

and if he requite thy curtesie, then he is thankefull, SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.157

but if thou bind him to requite it, then thou are couetous.
SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.158

Fourthly they say, Vsurie is necessarie for Orphanes and Widdowes
, and Straungers, which haue no other way to get their liuing,
SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.159

and therefore some Vsurie must be tolerated.  SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.160

If Vsurie be necessarie for vs, how did the <font> Iewes <$$font>
without it?  SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.161

Did God thinke it good for the state of their common weale to be without
Vsurers: SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.162

and is it good for the state of our common weale to haue Vsurers?
SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.163

this is wisdome against God.  SMITH-E2-P2,D2V.164

Fiftly they say: If I may not <P_D3R> gaine by the money which I lend,
I will lend no more, but keepe my money to my selfe: SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.165

nay, that is as bad to keepe thy money from them which neede, as to lend
thy money for Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.166

For Christ saith, <font> from him which borroweth, turne not away
thy face.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.167

Therefore thou are bound to lende.  SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.168

As he hath a cursse in <font> Prou. <$$font> 11. which
keepeth his Corne when hee should sell it to them which hunger: so he
hath a cursse in <font> Eze. <$$font> 18. which keepeth
his money when he should lende it to them which want.  SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.169

Sixtly they say, because Vsurie comes of biting, the biting Vsurie is
onely forbidden, and none but the biting Vsurie: SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.170

why then all Vsurie is forbidden, SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.171

for all Vsurie commeth of biting, to shewe that all Vsurie is vnlawfull.
SMITH-E2-P2,D3R.172

<P_D3V>

Lastly, they aleadge the Law of the land for it, SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.174

and say, the Queens Statute doeth allowe vs to take vppon Vsurie tenne
in the hundreth.  SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.175

These are like the <font> Iewes <$$font> which sayd, <font> We have a
lawe, SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.176

and by our lawe he shall dye: <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.177

when they could not saye by Gods lawe he shall die, then they said <font>
by our lawe he shall dye: <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.178

so when they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say by Gods lawe we may take Vsurie,
they say by mans law we may take Vsurie, SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.179

this is the poorest defence of all the rest: SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.180

for if Gods lawe forbid thee, can any lawe of man excuse thee:
SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.181

As it would not serue <font> Adam <$$font> to say, <font> the woman
bad me <$$font>, so it will not serue the Vsurer to say, the Lawe doth
licence me.  SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.182

But he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say, the Law doth license me:
SMITH-E2-P2,D3V.183

for though peraduenture our law do tollerate more than should be
tollerated, yet <P_D4R> I would haue you know, that our lawe doeth not
allow tenne in the hundreth, nor fiue in the hu~dreth, not one in the
hundreth, nor any Vsurie at all: SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.184

but there is a restraint in our law, that no Vsurer take aboue tenne in
the hundreth, SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.185

it doeth not allow tenne in the hundreth, SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.186

but punisheth that tyrant which exacteth aboue tenne in the hundreth.
SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.187

It is much like that tolleration which we reade of diuources.
SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.188

For the hardnesse of mens hearts, Christ saith, that <font> Moses <$$font>
did suffer the man and wife to part asunder: SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.189

So for the hardnesse of mens hearts, our <font> Moses <$$font> our Prince
is faine to suffer as it were a kinde of Vsurie, because otherwise no
men would lende.  SMITH-E2-P2,D4R.190

These are the best excuses which our Vsurers haue to pleade for
themselues, against they come <P_D4V> before the tribunall of God;
SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.191

and if their reasons will not stande before men nor their owne conscience
, how will they stande before the Lorde?  SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.192

Now, you long to heare what the Vsurer is like.  SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.193

to what shall I liken this generation?  SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.194

They are like a Butlers boxe: SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.195

for as all the counters at last come to the Butler: so all the money at
last commeth to the Vsurer, ten after ten, and ten after ten, and ten
to ten, till at last he receiue not onely ten for an hundreth, but an
hundreth for ten.  SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.196

This is the onely differnce, that the Butler ca~ receiue no more than
he deliuered: SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.197

but the Vsurer receiueth more than hee deliuereth.  SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.198

They are like a Moth; SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.199

euen as a Moth eateth a hole in cloath, so Vsurie eateth a hole in siluer:
SMITH-E2-P2,D4V.200

If you haue a peece of siluer which <P_D5R> is as much as an hundreth
pounds, in one yere Vsurie will eate a hole in it as big as ten pounds :
SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.201

in two yeares she will eate a hole as big as twentie pounds:
SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.202

in three yeares she will eate a hole as big as thirtie pounds.
SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.203

Nay, now they say, he is but a bad husband which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
eate a hole as big as fiftie pounds in a yeare: that is, which $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} gaine halfe in halfe: SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.204

how manie holes haue these Moths eaten in poore mens garments:
SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.205

They are like Nonresidents, that is, such bad members that no man speaketh
for them but themselues.  SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.206

As no man standeth for Nonresidencie but he which is a Nonresident, or
he which would be a Nonreside~t: so no man standeth for Vsurie but hee
which is an Vsurer, or hee which would be an Vsurer.  SMITH-E2-P2,D5R.207

They are like <font> Iezabel <$$font>, which said, <font> Let me <P_D5V>
alone, SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.208

I haue a way <$$font>, SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.209

If there bee no way to liue <paren> saieth the false Steward <$$paren>
I knowe what to doo, SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.210

I wil deceiue; SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.211

so if there bee no way to liue <paren> saieith the Vsurer <$$paren>
I knowe what to doo, SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.212

I will oppresse: SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.213

If I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} liue by buying, nor by selling,
nor by flattering, nor by labouring, I will liue by oppression.
SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.214

But as one in his Comment speakes to the false Steward, <font> Thou
saiest I knowe what to doo, but doest thou knowe what thou shalt suffer?
<$$font> So I saye to Vsurers, you saye you knowe what to doo, but doo
you knowe what you shall suffer?  SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.215

In deed he knoweth not what to do, which knoweth not to doo well:
SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.216

and therefore Christ saide of his persecutors, <font> that they knewe
not what they did.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.217

Now I may conclude with <font> Paul, SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.218

I haue not spoken but the Lord.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D5V.219

<P_D6R>

and therefore as the Lord said vnto <font> Saul <$$font>, that he
persecuted him: so they which resist this doctrine do contemne him,
and not me.  SMITH-E2-P2,D6R.221

<font> The end of the first Sermon.  <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,D6R.222

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample_2_here}

<P_F1R>

Now you would vnderstand the last question.  If you haue bin Vsurers
alreadie, what you should doe with that money which you haue by Vsurie ,
SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.225

surely euen as <font> Zacheus <$$font> did, restore it againe.
SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.226

If you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say as <font> Samuel <$$font> said,
<font> whose goods haue I taken?  <$$font> then you must saye as <font>
Zacheus <$$font> sayde, <font> whose goodes haue I kept?  <$$font>
SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.227

The best thinge is, to doe no man wrong, SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.228

but the next to that is, to make him amends.  SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.229

This God signifieth when he saith, <font> put away the execrable thing
from you, <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.230

that is, let no vnlawfull thing staye in youre hands, like the wedge of
<font> Achan <$$font> which he had got by sinne.  SMITH-E2-P2,F1R.231

The <P_F1V> same lawe serueth for all which is got wrongfully, which
was instituted against theeues, SMITH-E2-P2,F1V.232

<font> Restore it againe: <$$font> SMITH-E2-P2,F1V.233

the reason of this lawe is, because the sinne is not remitted, vntill
the debt be restored, SMITH-E2-P2,F1V.234

for as humilitie is the repentaunce of pride, and abstinence is the
repentaunce of surfet, and almes is the repentaunce of couetousnes,
and forgiuenes is the repentaunce of malice, so restitution is the
repentaunce of Vsurie; SMITH-E2-P2,F1V.235

as he which is not humble doeth not repent his pride, he which doeth
not abstaine doth not repent his gluttonie, he which doeth not forgiue,
doeth not repent his malice, so he which doeth not restore, doeth not
repent his Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,F1V.236

for how can he be said to repent for his Vsurie, which liueth by Vsurie
still.  SMITH-E2-P2,F1V.237

Therefore <font> Daniel <$$font> saith to <font> Nebuchadnezzar, <P_F2R>
Breake off thy sinnes by righteousness <$$font>, shewing, that nothing
but righteousnes can breake vnrighteousnes.  SMITH-E2-P2,F2R.238

As diseases are healed by the contrarie, so pride is healed by humilitie
, gluttonie by abstinence, malice by forgiuenes, couetousnes by almes,
and Vsurie by restoring.  SMITH-E2-P2,F2R.239

This <font> Paule <$$font> calleth, <font> The reuenge of a Christian,
<$$font> when he takes reuenge vpon his sinnes, and punisheth his lustes
, so that he maketh them do the contrarie to that which they would do.
SMITH-E2-P2,F2R.240

Therefore you must restore that which you haue got by Vsurie,
SMITH-E2-P2,F2R.241

or else you do not repent of your Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,F2R.242

As a Camell whe~ he come home, casteth off his burthen at the dore,
that he may enter into his Stable, so they which are laden with other
mens goodes, when they goe to heauen, <P_F2V> must leaue their burthen
where they had it, least they be too grose to get in at the narrow gate.
SMITH-E2-P2,F2V.243

But as the Disciple of Christ said, <font> this is a hard speech <$$font>
, so to them which haue got most that they haue by vnlawfull meanes,
this is a hard speech, to bid them restore it againe: SMITH-E2-P2,F2V.244

there be two great rubs in the way.  First, the losse which they shall
sustaine, if they restore againe all which they haue got vniustlie.  Then
the difficultie to restore it vnto the right parties.  SMITH-E2-P2,F2V.245

If you aske mee, as <font> Amaziah <$$font> asked the Prophet, <font>
How shall we doo for those hundreth tallents?  <$$font> How shall I
liue when al is gone which I haue got wrongfully?  I can say no more
than the Prophet said to him, SMITH-E2-P2,F2V.246

<font> The Lord is able to giue thee more than this.  SMITH-E2-P2,F2V.247

Zacheus <$$font> did not feare how he <P_F3R> should liue,
SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.248

but <font> Zacheus <$$font> did feare to offende: SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.249

so thou shouldest not feare to restore other mens goods,
SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.250

but thou shouldest feare to keepe other mens goods: SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.251

and as <font> Zacheus <$$font> liued when hee had restored, so thou
shalt liue when thou has restored.  SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.252

He which saith, <font> Trie me if I will not powre down a blessing
, <$$font> trie him whether he will not powre down a blessing;
SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.253

for he hath promised to blesse the lender aswell as the sacrificer.
SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.254

He which is the Lorde of all, can giue thee more than thou needest:
SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.255

but if you can not restore to the owner, nor to his heires, the~ giue
it to the poore, SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.256

for they are the next heires, SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.257

& repent that thou hast kept it so long: SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.258

but in no wise thou maiest keepe it to thy selfe, because it is none
of thine.  SMITH-E2-P2,F3R.259

When <font> Hezekiah <$$font> was like to <P_F3V> die, <font> Esaiah
<$$font> sayd vnto him, <font> Set thy things in order before thou
die <$$font>.  SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.260

That which hee aduised him hee aduiseth all; SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.261

set your things in order before you die.  SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.262

What is this to set things in order, but to restore vnto euerie one
his owne?  SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.263

When thou bequeathest thy bodie to the earth, then thy bodie is set in
order: SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.264

when thou bequeathest thy soule to God, then thy soule is set in order :
SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.265

when thou bequeathest thy goods to the owners, then thy goods are set
in order: SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.266

therefore if thou die with other me~s goods in thy hand, then thou diest
before thou haue set things in order, SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.267

and then thou diest in thy sinnes, SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.268

and then no promise in all the Scripture appertaineth vnto thee,
because nothing is promised vnto sinners but vnto penitent sinners.
SMITH-E2-P2,F3V.269

Therefore that you may not die in <P_F4R> your sinnes, it is necessary
to make restitution before you die, SMITH-E2-P2,F4R.270

or els you die in your sinne, SMITH-E2-P2,F4R.271

and are crossed out of all the ioyes of heauen.  SMITH-E2-P2,F4R.272

Therefore as <font> Abner <$$font> saide to <font> Ioah, Knowest thou not
that it will be bitternes in the latter end?  <$$font> So remember whether
this course will bee sweete or bitter in the end.  SMITH-E2-P2,F4R.273

Thus you haue heard the definition of Vsurie, and the deriuation of it,
and the vnlawfulness of it, and the kindes of it, and the punishment of
it, and the arguments which are alleaged for it, & what may bee thought
of them which doo not take Vusrie but giue Vsurie, and what they should
doo which haue got their liuing by Vsurie.  SMITH-E2-P2,F4R.274

Now, seeing you may not bee Vsurers to men, let euerie man hereafter
bee an Vsurer to God, <P_F4V> which promiseth; If thou leaue father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or house, or land for him, not ten in
the hundreth, but an hundreth for ten; nay an hundreth for one, and in
the world to come life euerlasting: SMITH-E2-P2,F4V.275

that is, a thousand for one.  SMITH-E2-P2,F4V.276

That we may receiue this Vsurie, let vs pray that the wordes which wee
haue heard out of this Psalme, may dwell with vs till we dwell in heauen.
SMITH-E2-P2,F4V.277

Finis.  SMITH-E2-P2,F4V.278
