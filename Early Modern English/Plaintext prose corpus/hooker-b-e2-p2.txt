<P_49>

28 HOOKER-B-E2-P2,49.2

To make a wicked and a sinful man most holy through his beleeuing,
is more then {it_is} to create a world of nothing.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,49.3

Our faith most holy?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,49.4

Surely <font> Solomon <$$font> <P_50> could not shew the Queene of <font>
Saba <$$font> so much treasure in all his kingdo~e, as is lapt vp in
these words.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.5

O that our hearts were stretched out like tents, & that the eies of
our vnderstanding were as bright as the sunne, that we might throughly
knowe the riches of the glorious inheritance of Saints, and what is the
exceeding greatnesse of his power towards vs, whome he accepteth for pure,
and most holy, through our beleeuing.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.6

O that the spirit of the Lord would giue this doctrine entrance into the
stonie and brasen hart of the Iew, which followeth the law of righteousnes
but $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attaine vnto the righteousnesse of the law.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.7

Wherefore?  saith the Apostle.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.8

They seeke righteousnesse, and not by faith.  Wherefore they stumble at
Christ, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.9

they are bruised, shivered to peeces as a ship that hath runne her selfe
vpon a rocke.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.10

O that God would cast downe the eies of the prowd, and humble the soules
of the high minded, that they might at length abhorre the garments of
their owne flesh which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} hide their nakednesse,
and put on the faith of Christ Iesus, as hee did put it on, which hath
said; <font> Doubtlesse I thinke all things but losse for the excellent
knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things
losse, and doe iudge them to be dung, that I might winne Christ, and might
be found in him, not hauing mine owne righteousnes, which is of the law,
but that which is through the faith of Christ, even the righteousnesse
which is of God through faith.  <$$font> HOOKER-B-E2-P2,50.11

O that God would open the Arke of mercy, wherein this doctrine lyeth,
and set it wide before the eies of poore afflicted consciences, which
fly vp and downe <P_51> vpon the water of their afflictions, & can see
nothing but only the gulfe and deluge of their sinnes, wherein there is
no place for them to rest their feet.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.12

The God of pittie and compassion giue you al strength & courage, every
day, and every houre, & every moment, to build, and edifie your selues
in this most pure & holy faith.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.13

And thus much both of the thing prescribed in this exhortatio~, & also
of the properties of the thing.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.14

Build your selues in your most holy faith.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.15

I would co~e to the next branch, which is of <font> Prayer <$$font>
, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.16

but I $can $not {TEXT:ca~not} lay this matter out of my ha~ds, til I haue
added somwhat for the applying of it both to others, & to our selues.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.17

29 HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.18

For your better vnderstanding of matters contained in this exhortation,
<font> Build your selues <$$font>, you must note, that every Church and
congregatio~ doth consist of a multitude of beleeuers, as every house
is built of many stones.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.19

And although the nature of the mystical body of the Church be such, that
it suffereth no distinction in the invisible members, but whether it
be <font> Paul <$$font> or <font> Apollos <$$font>, Prince or Prophet,
hee that is taught, or he that teacheth, all are equally Christs, &
Christ is equally theirs: yet in the externall administration of the
Church of God, because God is not the author of confusion but of peace,
it is necessary that in every Congregation there be a distinction, if
not of inward dignitie, yet of outward degree: so that all are Saints,
or seeme to be Saints, and should bee as they seeme.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.20

But are all Apostles?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.21

If the whole bodie were an eie, where were then the hearing?
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,51.22

God therfore hath giuen some to be Apostles, and some to be Pastours ,
&c. for the edification~ of the body of Christ.  <P_52> In which
worke we are Gods labourers, saith the Apostle, & yee are Gods husbandry,
& Gods building.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,52.23

30.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,52.24

The Church respected with reference vnto administration ecclesiastical
, doth generally consist but of 2 sorts of men, the <font> Labourers
<$$font>, & the <font> Building <$$font>; they which are ministred
vnto, and they to whom the worke of the ministery is committed; <font>
Pastours <$$font> & the <font> flocke <$$font>, over whom the holy Ghost
hath made them overseers.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,52.25

If the <font> Guid <$$font> of a Congregation <paren> be his name or his
degree whatsoever <$$paren> be diligent in his vocation, feed the flocke
of God which dependeth vpon him, caring for it not by constraint but
willingly, not for filthie lucre, but of a ready mind, not as though hee
would tyrannize over Gods heritage, but as a patterne vnto the flocke,
wisely guiding them: if the people in their degree doe yeeld themselues
frameable to the truth, not like rough stone or flint refusing to bee
smoothed and squared for the building: if the Magistrate doe carefully
and diligently survey the whole order of the worke, providing by statutes
and lawes, & bodily punishments , if need require, that all things may
be done according to the rule which $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deceaue,
even as <font> Moses <$$font> provided that all things might be done
according to the patterne which hee saw in the Mount; there the words of
this exhortation are truely and effectually heard.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,52.26

Of such a Congregation every man will say, <font> Behold a people that
are wise, a people that walke in the statutes and ordinances of their
God, a people full of knowledge and vnderstanding, a people that haue
skill in building themselues.  <$$font> HOOKER-B-E2-P2,52.27

Where it is otherwise there, <font> as by slothfulnesse the roofe
doth decay <$$font>, & as <font> by idlenesse <P_53> of hands the
house droppeth thorough <$$font>, as it is in the 10. of
Ecclesiastes, v. 18, so first one peece and then another of their
building shal fall away, till there be not a stone left vpon a stone.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.28

31 HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.29

We see how fruitlesse this exhortation hath bene to such as bend all
their trauaile onely to build {and} manage a <font> Papacie <$$font>
vpon earth, without any care in the world of building the~selues in
their most holy faith.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.30

Gods people haue enquired at their mouthes, <font> What shall we doe to
haue eternall life?  <$$font> HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.31

where-in shall we build & edifie our selues?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.32

And they haue departed ho~e fro~ their Prophets, & from their priests,
laden with doctrines, which are precepts of men; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.33

they haue bene taught to tire out themselues with bodily excercise;
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.34

those thinges are inioyned them which God did never require at their
hands, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.35

and the things he doth require are kept fro~ the~; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.36

their eies are fed with pictures, and their eares filled with melodie,
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.37

but their soules do wither, and starue, and pine away;
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.38

they crie for bread, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.39

and behold stones are offered them; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.40

they aske for fishe, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.41

and see they haue scorpions in their hands; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.42

Thou seest, O Lord, that they builde themselues, but not in faith;
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.43

they feede their children but not with food; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.44

Their rules say with shame, Bring, & not build.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.45

But god is righteous; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.46

their dru~kennesse stinketh, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.47

their abominations are knowne, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.48

their madnesse is manifest, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.49

the winde hath bound them vp in hir wings, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.50

and they shall be ashamed of their doings.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.51

<font> Ephraim <$$font>, saith the <font> Prophet <$$font>, is ioyned
to Idoles, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.52

let him alone, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,53.53

I will turne me therfore from the Preists which do minister vnto Idoles
, & applie this exhortation to the~ whom <P_54> god hath appointed to
feede his chosen in Israell.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.54

32 HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.55

If their be any feeling of Christ, and drop of heavenly dewe, any spark
of Gods good spirit within you, stirre it vp, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.56

be careful to build and edifie first your selues, & then your flockes
in this most holy faith.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.57

33 HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.58

I say, <font> first your selues <$$font>; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.59

For he which wil set the hearts of other men on fire with the loue of
Christ, must himselfe burne with loue.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.60

It is want of faith in our selues, My Brethren, which maketh vs retchlesse
{COM:carelesse} in building others.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.61

We forsake the Lords inheritance HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.62

and feed it not.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.63

What is the reason of this?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.64

Our own desires are setled where they should not be.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.65

Wee our selues are like those women which haue a longing to eate coales,
and lime, and filth; HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.66

we are fed, some with honour, some with ease, some with wealth;
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.67

the Gospell waxeth loathsome & vnpleasant in our tast;
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.68

how should we then haue a care to feed others with that which we $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} fancie our selues?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.69

If <font> faith <$$font> wax cold, and slender in the <font> heart
<$$font> of the <font> Prophet <$$font>, it will soone perish from the
eares of the people.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.70

The Prophet <font> Amos <$$font> speaketh of a famine, saying, <font>
I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst
of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.71

Men shall wander from sea to sea, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.72

and from the north vnto the east shall they runne to and fro to seeke
the word of the Lord, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.73

and shall not find it.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.74

Iudgement must beginne at the house of God <$$font>, saith <font>
Peter <$$font>.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.75

Yea, I say, at the sanctuarie of God this iudgeme~t must begin.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.76

This famine must begin at the hart of the Prophet.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.77

He must haue darknes for a vision, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.78

hee must stumble at noone daies, as at the twi-light, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.79

and then truth shall fall in middest of the streets, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,54.80

then shall the <P_55> people wander from sea to sea, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.81

and from the North vnto the east shall they runne to and fro to seeke
the word of the Lord.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.82

34 HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.83

In the second of Haggaie, <font> speake now <$$font>, saith God to his
prophet, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.84

<font> Speake now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel Prince of Iudah, &
to Iehoshua the son of Iebozadak the high priest, & to the residue of
the people, saying, who is left among you that saw this house in hir
first glory, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.85

and how doe you see it now?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.86

is not this house in your eies, in comparison of it, as nothing?  <$$font>
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.87

the prophet would haue all mens eies turned to the veiw of the~selues
, every sort brought to the consideration of their present state.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.88

This is no place to shew what dutie <font> Zerubbabel <$$font> or <font>
Iehoshua <$$font> doth owe vnto God in this respect.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.89

They haue I doubt not such as put them hereof in remembra~ce.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.90

I aske of you which are a part of the residue of Gods elect & chosen
people.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.91

Who is their amongst you that hath take~ a survey of the house of
God , as it was in the daies of the blessed Apostles of Iesus Christ?
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.92

who is there amongst you that hath seen & con~sidred this holy temple
in her first glory?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.93

& how do you see it now?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.94

Is it not in comparison of the other almost as nothing whe~ ye look vpo~
the~ that haue vndertake~ the charge of your soules, & know how far
these are for the most part growne out of kind, how few there be that
tread the steps of their ancient predecessors, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.95

yee are easily filled with indignation, easily drawne vnto these
co~plaints, wherein the difference of present fro~ former times is
bewailed, easily persuaded to think of the~ that lived to enioy the
daies which now are gon.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,55.96

Surely they were happy in co~parison of vs that haue <P_56> succeeded
them: HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.97

were not their Bishops me~ vnreprovable, wise, righteous, holy , te~perat,
wel reported of even of those which were without?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.98

were not their Pastours, guids, & teachers, able & willing to exhort
with wholso~e doctrine & to improue which gainesaid the truth?
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.99

had they priests made of the refuse of the people?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.100

were men, like to the children which were in <font> Niniveh <$$font> ,
unable to discerne betweene the right hand & the left, presented to the
charge of their congregation?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.101

did their teachers leaue their flocks over which the holy Ghost had made
them overseers?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.102

Did their Prophets enter vpon holy things as spoils, without a reverend
calling?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.103

were their leaders so vnkindly affected towards the~ that they could
find in their hearts to sel them as sheepe or oxen, not caring how they
made them away?  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.104

But beloued, deceaue not your selues.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.105

Doe the faults of your guids and pastours offend you?
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.106

it is your fault if they bee thus faulty.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.107

<font> Nullus qui malu~ rectore~ patitur, eu~ accuset, quia sui fuit
meriti perversi pastoris subiacere ditioni <$$font>, saith S.
<font> Gregory <$$font>, HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.108

whosoever thou art whom the inco~venience of an evil governor doth presse
, accuse thy selfe, & not him.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.109

His being such, is thy deseruing HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.110

<font> O yee disobedient children, turn again <$$font>, saith the
Lord, <font> & the~ wil I giue you pastours according to mine own
hart, which shall feed you with knowledge & vndersta~ding <$$font>.
HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.111

So that the only way to repaire all ruines, breaches, & offensiue
decaies in others, is to begin reformation at your selues.  Which that
we may all sincerely, seriously, and speedily doe, God the Father grant
for his sonne our Saviour Iesus sake, vnto whom with the holy Ghost,
three persons, one Eternall and everlasting God, be Honour, and Glory,
and Praise forever.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.112

<font> Amen <$$font>.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.113

Finis.  HOOKER-B-E2-P2,56.114
