You have taken a great deal of Pains to instruct me, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.4

and what $d'$ye {TEXT:d'ye} think I have learn't by it?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.5

<font> Arch. <$$font> What?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.6

<font> Cher. <$$font> That your Discourse and your Habit are
Contradictions, and it wou'd be nonsense in me to believe you a Footman
any longer.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.7

<font> Arch. <$$font>'Oons, what a Witch it is!
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.8

<font> Cher. <$$font> Depend upon this, Sir, nothing in this Garb
shall ever tempt me; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.9

for tho'I was born to Servitude, I hate it: - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.10

Own your Condition, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.11

swear you love me, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.12

and then - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.13

<font> Arch. <$$font> And then we shall go make the Bed.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.14

<font> Cher. <$$font> Yes.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.15

<font> Arch. <$$font> You must know then, that I am born a
Gentleman, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.16

my Education was liberal; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.17

but I went to <font> London <$$font> a younger Brother,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.18

fell into the Hands of Sharpers, who stript me of my Money,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.19

my Friends disown'd me, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.20

and now my Necessity brings me to what you see.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.21

<font> Cher. <$$font> Then take my Hand - promise to marry
me before you sleep, and $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} make you Master of two
thousand Pound.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.22

<font> Arch. <$$font> How!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.23

<font> Cher. <$$font> Two thousand Pound that I have this Minute
in my own Custody; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.24

so throw off your Livery this Instant, and $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} go find
a Parson.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.25

<font> Arch. <$$font> What said you?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.26

A Parson!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.27

<font> Cher. <$$font> What!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.28

do you scruple?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.29

<font> Arch. <$$font> Scruple!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.30

no, no, but - two thousand Pound you say?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.31

<font> Cher. <$$font> And better.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.32

<font> Arch. <$$font> S'death, what shall I do -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.33

but $heark $'e {TEXT:heark'e}, Child, what need you make me Master of
your self and Money, when you may have the same Pleasure out of me,
and still keep your Fortune in your Hands.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.34

<font> Cher. <$$font> Then you $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} marry me?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.35

<font> Arch. <$$font> I wou'd marry you, but - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,20.36

<P_21>

<font> Cher. <$$font> O sweet, Sir, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} your humble
Servant, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.38

$you $'re {TEXT:you're} fairly caught, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.39

wou'd you perswade me that any Gentleman who cou'd bear the Scandal of
wearing a Livery, wou'd refuse two thousand Pound let the Condition be
what it wou'd - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.40

no, no, Sir, - but I hope $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} Pardon the Freedom I
have taken, since it was only to inform my self of the Respect that I
ought to pay you.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.41

<font> Going.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.42

Arch. <$$font> Fairly bit, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.43

by <font> Jupiter <$$font> hold, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.44

hold, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.45

and have you actually two thousand Pound.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.46

<font> Cher. <$$font> Sir, I have my Secrets as well as you -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.47

when you please to be more open, I shall be more free,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.48

and be assur'd that I have Discoveries that will match yours, be what
they will - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.49

in the mean while be satisfy'd that no Discovery I make shall ever hurt
you, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.50

but beware of my Father.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.51

<font> Arch. <$$font> So - $we $'re {TEXT:we're} like to have as
many Adventures in our Inn, as <font> Don Quixote <$$font> had in his -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.52

let me see, two thousand Pound!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.53

if the Wench wou'd promise to dye when the Money were spent, I gad,
one wou'd marry her, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.54

but the Fortune may go off in a Year or two, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.55

and the Wife may live - Lord knows how long?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.56

then an Inkeeper's Daughter; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.57

ay $that $'s {TEXT:that's} the Devil - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,21.58

Enter Mrs. <$$font> Sullen, Dorinda.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.68

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha, nay dear Sister,
let me embrace thee, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.69

now $you $'ll {TEXT:you'll} be good for something, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.72

I shall have you conversable in the Subjects of the Sex.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.73

<font> Dor. <$$font> But do you think that I am so weak as to
fall in Love with a Fellow at first sight?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.74

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Pshaw!  now you spoil all,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.75

why shou'd not we be as free in our Friendships as the Men?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.76

I warrant you the Gentleman has got to his Confident already, has avow'd
his Passion, toasted your Health, call'd you ten thousand Angels, has run
over your Lips, Eyes, Neck, Shape, Air and every thing, in a Decription
that warms their Mirth to a second Enjoyment.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.77

<font> Dor. <$$font> FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.78

Your Hand, Sister, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.79

so - now tell me, $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you like the Gentleman that we

<font> Dor. <$$font> The $Man $'s {TEXT:Man's} well enough.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.85

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Well enough!
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.86

is he not a Demigod, a <font> Narcissus <$$font>, a Star, the Man $in
$the {TEXT:i'the} Moon?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.87

<font> Dor. <$$font> O Sister, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} extreamly ill.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.88

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Shall I send to your Mother,
Child, for a little of her Cephalick Plaister to put to the Soals of
your Feet, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.89

or shall I send to the Gentleman for something for you?  -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.90

Come, unlace your Steas, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.91

unbosome your self - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.92

the Man is perfectly a pretty Fellow, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.93

I saw him when he first came into Church.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.94

<font> Dor. <$$font> I saw him too, Sister, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.95

and with an Air that shone, $me $thought {TEXT:methought} like Rays
about his Person.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.96

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Well said, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.97

up with it.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.98

<font> Dor. <$$font> No forward Coquett Behaviour, no Airs to
set him off, no study'd Looks nor artful Posture, - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.99

but Nature did it all - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.100

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> better and better - one Touch
more - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.101

come.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.102

<font> Dor. <$$font> But then his Looks - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.103

did you observe his Eyes?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,22.104

<P_23>

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Yes, yes, I did -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.106

his Eyes, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.107

well, what of his Eyes?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.108

<font> Dor. <$$font> Sprightly, but not wandring; they seem'd to
view, but never gaz'd on any thing but me - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.109

and then his Looks so humble were, and yet so noble, that they aim'd to
tell me that he cou'd with Pride dye at my Feet, tho'he scorn'd Slavery
any where else.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.110

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The Phyfick works purely -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.111

How $d'$ye {TEXT:d'ye} find your self now, my Dear?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.112

<font> Dor. <$$font> Hem!  much better, my Dear -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.113

O here comes our Mercury!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.114

<paren> <font> Enter <$$font> Scrub <$$paren> FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.115

Well <font> Scrub <$$font>, what News of the Gentleman?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.116

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Madam, I have brought you a Packet of News.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.117

<font> Dor. <$$font> Open it quickly, come.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.118

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> In the first place I enquir'd who the Gentleman
was?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.119

they told me he was a Stranger, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.120

Secondly, I ask'd what the Gentleman was, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.121

they answer'd FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.122

and said, that they never saw him before.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.123

Thirdly, I enquir'd what Countryman he was, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.124

they reply'd $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} more than they knew.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.125

Fourthly, I demanded whence he came, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.126

their Answer was, they cou'd not tell.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.127

And Fifthly, I ask'd whither he went, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.128

and they reply'd they knew nothing of the matter, - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.129

and this is all I cou'd learn.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.130

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> But what do the People say,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.131

$can $n't {TEXT:can't} they guess?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.132

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> why some think $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a Spy,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.133

some guess $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a Mountebank, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.134

some say one thing, some another; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.135

but for my own part, I believe $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a Jesuit.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.136

<font> Dor. <$$font> A Jesuit!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.137

why a Jesuit?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.138

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> because he keeps his Horses always ready sadled
, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.139

and his Footman talks French.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.140

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> His Footman!
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.141

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Ay, he and the Count's Footman were Gabbering
French like two intreaguing Ducks in a Mill-Pond, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.142

and I believe they talk'd of me, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.143

for they laugh'd consumedly.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.144

<font> Dor. <$$font> What sort of Livery has the Footman?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.145

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Livery!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.146

Lord, Madam, I took him for a Captain, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} so bedizen'd
with Lace, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.147

and then he has Tops to his Shoes, up to his mid Leg, a silver headed
Cane dangling at his Nuckles, - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.148

he carries his Hands in his Pockets just so - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.149

<paren> <font> Walks in the French Air <$$font> <$$paren>
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.150

and has a fine long Perriwig ty'd up in a Bag - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.151

Lord, Madam, $he $'s {TEXT:he's} clear another sort of Man than I.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,23.152

<P_24>

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> That may easily be -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.154

but what shall we do now, Sister?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.155

<font> Dor. <$$font> I have it - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.156

This Fellow has a world of Simplicity, and some Cunning,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.157

the first hides the latter by abundance.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.158

<font> Scrub.  {COM:Scrub._Scrub} <$$font> Madam.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.159

<font> Dor. <$$font> We have a great mind to know who this
Gentleman is, only for our Satisfaction.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.160

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Yes, Madam, it would be a Satisfaction, no doubt.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.161

<font> Dor. <$$font> You must go and get acquainted with his
Footman, and invite him hither to drink a Bottle of your Ale, because
$you $'re {TEXT:you're} Butler to Day.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.162

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Yes, Madam, I am Butler every Sunday.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.163

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> O brave, Sister, O my Conscience,
you understand the Mathematicks already - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.164

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} the best Plot in the World, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.165

your Mother, you know, will be gone to Church, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.166

my Spouse will be got to the Ale-house with his Scoundrels,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.167

and the House will be our own - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.168

so we drop in by Accident FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.169

and ask the Fellow some Questions our selves.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.170

In the Countrey you know any Stranger is Company, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.171

and $we $'re {TEXT:we're} glad to take up with the Butler in a
Country Dance, and happy if $he $'ll {TEXT:he'll} do us the Favour.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.172

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Oh!  Madam, you wrong me, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,24.173

I never refus'd your Ladyship the Favour in my Life.

her Pocket, you mean; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,25.195

<font> Gib. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} wonder at that,

FARQUHAR-E3-P2,26.264

<font> Aim. <$$font> And pray, Sir, how came I by the Honour of
seeing you now?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,26.265

<font> Gib. <$$font> Sir, I scorn to intrude upon any Gentleman -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,26.266

Besides $'t $was {TEXT:'twas} for the good of my <P_27> Country that I

Any thing for the good of one's Country - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.280

$I $'m {TEXT:I'm} a <font> Roman <$$font> for that.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.281

<font> Gib. <$$font> My $Company $'s {TEXT:Company's} but thin,

we are but three, ha, ha, ha.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.300

<font> Aim. <$$font> $You $'re {TEXT:You're} merry, Sir.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.301

<font> Gib. <$$font> Ay, Sir, you must excuse me, Sir,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.302

I understand the World, especially, the Art of Travelling;
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.303

I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care, Sir, for answering Questions directly upon
the Road - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.304

for I generally ride with a Charge about me.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.305

not, Sir, that I cou'd suspect a Gentleman of your Figure -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.310

But truly, Sir, I have got such a way of Evasion upon the Road,
that I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} care for speaking Truth to any Man.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.311

<font> Aim. <$$font> Your Caution may be necessary -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.312

Then I presume $you $'re {TEXT:you're} no Captain?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.313

<font> Gib. <$$font> Not I, Sir, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.314

Captain is a good travelling Name, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.315

and so I take it; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.316

it stops a great many foolish Inquiries that are generally made about
Gentlemen that travel, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.317

it gives a Man an Air of something, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.318

and makes the Drawers obedient -- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.319

And thus far I am a Captain, and no farther.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.320

<font> Aim. <$$font> And pray, Sir, what is your true Profession?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,27.321

Can he speak English, Landlord.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,28.341

<font> Bon. <$$font> Very well, Sir, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,28.342

you may know him, as the saying is, to be a Foreigner by his Accent,

for the Justices $wo $n't {TEXT:won't} give their own Servants a bad
Example.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.454

Now this is my Misfortune - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.455

I dare not speak in the House, while that jade <font> Gipsey <$$font>
dings about like a Fury - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.456

Once I had the better end of the Staff.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.457

<font> Arch. <$$font> And how comes the Change now?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.458

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Why, the Mother of all this Mischief is a Priest.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.459

<font> Arch. <$$font> A Priest!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.460

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Ay, a damn'd Son of a Whore of <font> Babylon
<$$font>, that came over hither to say Grace to the <font> French <$$font>
Officers, and eat up our Provisions - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.461

$There $'s {TEXT:There's} not a Day goes over his Head with out Dinner
or Supper in this House.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.462

<font> Arch. <$$font> How came he so familiar in the Family?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.463

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Because he speaks <font> English <$$font> as if
he had liv'd here all his Life; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.464

and tells Lies as if he had been a Traveller from his Cradle.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.465

<font> Arch. <$$font> And this Priest, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm}
afraid has converted the Affections of your <font> Gipsey <$$font>.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.466

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Converted!  ay, and perverted, my dear Friend :
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.467

For $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} afraid he has made her a Whore and a Papist.
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.468

But this is not all; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.469

$there $'s {TEXT:there's} the <font> French <$$font> Count and Mrs.
<font> Sullen <$$font>, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.470

$they $'re {TEXT:they're} in the Confederacy, and for some private Ends
of their own to be sure.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.471

<font> Arch. <$$font> A very hopeful Family yours, Brother <font>
Scrub <$$font>; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.472

I suppose the Maiden Lady has her Lover too.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.473

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Not that I know; - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.474

$She $'s {TEXT:She's} the best on'em, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.475

$that $'s {TEXT:that's} the Truth on't: FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.476

But they take care to prevent my Curiosity, by giving me so much Business
, that $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} a perfect Slave.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.477

What $d'$ye {TEXT:d'ye} think is my Place in this Family?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.478

<font> Arch. <$$font> Butler, I suppose.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.479

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Ah, Lord help you - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.480

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} tell you - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.481

Of a <font> Monday <$$font>, I drive the Coach; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.482

of a <font> Tuesday <$$font>, I drive the Plough; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.483

on <font> Fryday <$$font>, I go to Market; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.486

on <font> Saturday <$$font>, I draw Warrants; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.487

and a <font> Sunday <$$font> I draw Beer.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.488

<font> Arch. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.489

if variety be a Pleasure in Life, you have enough on't, my dear Brother
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.490

But what Ladies are those?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.491

<font> $Scrub {TEXT:Arch.} <$$font> Ours, ours; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.492

that upon the right Hand is Mrs. <font> Sullen <$$font>,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.493

and the other is Mrs. <font> Dorinda <$$font>.  -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.494

$Do $n't {TEXT:Don't} mind'em, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,31.495

FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.498

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I have heard my Brother talk
of my Lord <font> Aimwell <$$font>, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.499

but they say that his Brother is the finer Gentleman.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.500

<font> Dor. <$$font> $That $'s {TEXT:That's} impossible, Sister.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.501

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> $He $'s {TEXT:He's} vastly rich,
but very close, they say.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.502

<font> Dor. <$$font> No matter for that; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.503

if I can creep into his Heart, $I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} open his Breast,
I warrant him: FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.504

I have heard say, that People may be guess'd at by the Behaviour of
their Servants; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.505

I cou'd wish we might talk to that Fellow.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.506

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> So do I; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.507

for, I think $he $'s {TEXT:he's} a very pretty Fellow:
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.508

Come this way, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.509

$I $'ll {TEXT:I'll} throw out a Lure for him presently.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.510

<paren> They walk a turn towards the opposite side of the Stage,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.511

Mrs. <font> Sullen <$$font> drops her Glove, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.512

<font> Archer <$$font> runs, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.513

takes it up, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.514

and gives it to her.  <$$paren> FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.515

<font> Arch. <$$font> Corn, Wine, and Oil, indeed -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.516

But, I think, the Wife has the greatest plenty of Flesh and Blood;
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.517

she should be my Choice - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.518

Ah, a, say you so Madam - Your Ladyship's Glove.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.519

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> O, Sir, I thank you -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.520

what a handsom Bow the Fellow has?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.521

<font> Dor. <$$font> Bow!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.522

why I have known several Footmen come down from <font> London <$$font>
set up here for Dancing-Masters, and carry off the best Fortunes in
the Country.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.523

<font> Arch. <$$font> <paren> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$paren>
That Project, for ought I know, had been better than ours, Brother <font>
Scrub <$$font> - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.524

Why $do $n't {TEXT:don't} you introduce me.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.525

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Ladies, this is the strange Gentleman's Servant
that you see at Church to Day; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.526

I understood he came from <font> London <$$font>, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.527

and so I invited him to the Cellar, that he might show me the newest
Flourish in whetting my Knives.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.528

<font> Dor. <$$font> And I hope you have made much of him?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.529

<font> Arch. <$$font> O yes, Madam, but the Strength of your
Ladyship's Liquour is a little too potent for the Constitution of your
humble Servant.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.530

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> What, then you $do $n't
{TEXT:don't} usually drink Ale?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.531

<font> Arch. <$$font> No, Madam, my constant Drink is Tea, or a
little Wine and Water; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.532

$'t $is {TEXT:'tis} prescrib'd me by the Physician for a Remedy against
the Spleen.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.533

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> O la, O la!  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.534

a Footman have the Spleen.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.535

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I thought that Distemper had
been only proper to People of Quality.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,32.536

<P_33>

<font> Arch. <$$font> Madam, like all other Fashions it wears out,
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.538

and so descends to their Servants; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.539

tho'in a great many of us, I believe it proceeds from some melancholly
Particles in the Blood, occason'd by the Stagnation of Wages.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.540

<font> Dor. <$$font> How affectedly the Fellow talks -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.541

How long, pray, have you serv'd your present Master?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.542

<font> Arch. <$$font> Not long; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.543

my Life has been mostly spent in the Service of the Ladies.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.544

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> And pray, which Service do you
like best?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.545

<font> Arch. <$$font> Madam, the Ladies pay best;
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.546

the Honour of serving there is sufficient Wages; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.547

there is a Charm in their looks that delivers a Pleasure with
their Commands, and gives our Duty the Wings of Inclination.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.548

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> That Flight was above the pitch
of a Livery; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.549

and, Sir, wou'd not you be satisfied to serve a Lady again?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.550

<font> Arch. <$$font> As a Groom of the Chamber, Madam, but not
as a Footman.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.551

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I suppose you serv'd as Footman
before.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.552

<font> Arch. <$$font> For that Reason I wou'd not serve in that
Post again; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.553

for my Memory is too weak for the load of Messages that the Ladies lay
upon their Servants in <font> London <$$font>; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.554

my Lady <font> Howd'ye <$$font>, the last Mistress I serv'd call'd me
up one Morning, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.555

and told me, <font> Martin <$$font>, go to my Lady <font> Allnight
<$$font> with my humble Service; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.556

tell her I was to wait on her Ladyship yesterday, and left word with
Mrs. <font> Rebecca <$$font>, that the Preliminaries of the Affair
she knows of, are stopt till we know the concurrence of the Person that
I know of, for which there are Circumstances wanting which we shall
accommodate at the old Place; but that in the mean time there is a Person
about her Ladyship, that from several Hints and Surmises, was accessary
at a certain time to the disappointments that naturally attend things,
that to her knowledge are of more Importance.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.557

Mrs. <font> Sull. Dor. <$$font> Ha, ha, ha!
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.558

where are you going, Sir?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.559

<font> Arch. <$$font> Why, I $ha $n't {TEXT:han't} half done.
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.560

The whole Howd'ye was about half an Hour long; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.561

so I hapned to misplace two Syllables, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.562

and was turn'd off, and render'd incapable - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.563

<font> Dor. <$$font> The pleasantest Fellow, Sister, I ever saw.
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.564

But, Friend, if your Master be marry'd, - I presume you still serve
a Lady.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,33.565

<P_34>

<font> Arch. <$$font> No, Madam, I take care never to come into
a marry'd Family; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.567

the Commands of the Master and Mistress are always so contrary, $that
$'t $is {TEXT:that'tis} impossible to please both.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.568

<font> Dor. <$$font> $There $'s {TEXT:There's} a main point gain'd.
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.569

My Lord is not marry'd, I find.  <paren> <font> Aside.  <$$font> <$$paren>
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.570

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> But, I wonder, Friend, that
in so many good Services, you had not a better Provision made for you.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.571

<font> Arch. <$$font> I $do $n't {TEXT:don't} know how, Madam.
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.572

I had a Lieutenancy offer'd mee three or four Times; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.573

but that is not Bread, Madam - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.574

I live much better as I do.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.575

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> Madam, he sings rarely.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.576

I was thought to do pretty well here in the Country till he came;
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.577

but alack a day, $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} nothing to my Brother <font> Martin
<$$font>.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.578

<font> Dor. <$$font> Does he?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.579

Pray, Sir, will you oblige us with a Song?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.580

<font> Arch. <$$font> Are you for Passion, or Humour?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.581

<font> Scrub.  <$$font> O le!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.582

he has the purer Ballad about a Triflle - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.583

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> A Trifle!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.584

pray, Sir, $let $'s {TEXT:let's} have it.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.585

<font> Arch. <$$font> $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} asham'd to offer you a
Trifle, Madam: FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.586

But since you command me - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.587

<font> Sings to the Tune of Sir <$$font> Simon <font> the King <$$font>
{COM:song_omitted} FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.588

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Very well, Sir, $we $'re
{TEXT:we're} obliged to you - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.589

Something for a pair of Gloves.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.590

Offering him Money.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.591

<font> Arch. <$$font> I humbly beg leave to be excused:
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.592

My Master, Madam, pays me; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.593

nor dare I take Money from any other Hand without injuring his Honour,
and disobeying his Commands.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.594

<font> Exit.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.595

Dor. <$$font> This is surprising: FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.596

Did you ever see so pretty a well bred Fellow?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.597

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The Devil take him for wearing
that Livery.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.598

<font> Dor. <$$font> I fancy, Sister, he may be some Gentleman,
a Friend of my Lords, that his Lordship has pitch'd upon for his Courage
, Fidelity, and Discretion to bear him Company in this Dress, and who,
ten to one was his Second too.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.599

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> It is so, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.600

it must be so, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.601

and it shall be so: - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.602

For I like him.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.603

<font> Dor. <$$font> What!  better than the Count?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.604

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The Count happen'd to be the
most agreeable Man upon the Place; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.605

and so I chose him to serve me in my Design upon my Husband.  -
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.606

But I shou'd like this Fellow better in a Design upon my self.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,34.607

<P_35>

<font> Dor. <$$font> But now, Sister, for an Interview
with this Lord, and this Gentleman; how shall we bring that about?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.609

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Patience!  you Country Ladies
give no Quarter, if once you be enter'd.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.610

Wou'd you prevent their Desires, and give the Fellows no wishing-time.
- FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.611

$Look $ye {TEXT:Look'ye}, <font> Dorinda <$$font>, if my Lord <font>
Aimwell <$$font> loves you or deserves you, $he $'ll {TEXT:he'll} find
a way to see you, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.612

and there we must leave it.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.613

My Business comes now upon the Tapis - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.614

Have you prepar'd your Brother?  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.615

<font> Dor. <$$font> Yes, yes.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.616

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> And how did he relish it?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.617

<font> Dor. <$$font> He said little, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.618

mumbled something to himself, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.619

promis'd to be guided by me: FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.620

But here he comes - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.621

<font> Enter <$$font> Sullen.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.622

<font> Sull. <$$font> What singing was that I heard just now?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.623

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> The singing in you're Head,
my Dear, FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.624

<font> Sull. <$$font> $You $'re {TEXT:You're} impertinent.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.626

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> I was ever so, since I became
one Flesh with you.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.627

<font> Sull. <$$font> One Flesh!  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.628

rather two Carcasses join'd unnaturally together.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.629

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Or rather a living Soul coupled
to a dead Body.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.630

<font> Dor. <$$font> So, this is fine Encouragment for me.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.631

<font> Sull. <$$font> Yes, my Wife shews you what you must do.
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.632

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> And my Husband shews you what
you must suffer.  FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.633

<font> Sull. <$$font> S'death, why $can $n't {TEXT:can't} you

<font> Sull. <$$font> Do you talk to any purpose?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.636

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> Do you think to any purpose?

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> What did he whisper to ye?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.642

<font> Dor. <$$font> That he wou'd go round the back way, come
into the Closet, and listen as I directed him.  - FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.643

But let me beg you once more, dear Sister, to drop this Project;
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.644

for, as I told you before, instead of awaking him to Kindness, you may
provoke him to a rage; FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.645

and then who knows how far his Brutality may carry him?
FARQUHAR-E3-P2,35.646

Mrs. <font> Sull. <$$font> $I $'m {TEXT:I'm} provided to
