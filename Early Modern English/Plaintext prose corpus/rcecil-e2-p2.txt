M=r= Edmondes.  Yo=w= shall vnderstand that Mons=r= Lominy hath had
his audience, and for y=e= reasonnes contained in her ma=tes= Letters
to yo=w= is very lyke to haue the aunswere w=ch= is contained in y=e=
same; RCECIL-E2-P2,270.3

But hereof her ma=tie= would haue y=e= king informed by yo=w=, and at
full length to y=e= end he maie know the iust reasonnes of the same:
RCECIL-E2-P2,270.4

for as it is not a denyall but a suspence, so I assure yo=w= in pryvate
that this mans choler, and manaces, hath made it y=e= worse for ye=
present.  RCECIL-E2-P2,270.5

But forasmuch as her Ma=tie=, {COM:sic} heareth, that y=e= king when he
knowes y=e= substance of letters not to satisfie him, will not haue y=e=
patience to heare the wholle Circumstance, and because it may be that
this man will Report y=e= worst, her ma=tie= commendeth it to yo=r=
dexteritie and discretion to vse y=e= matter so as to gett accesse to
y=e= king before he arryve, and to put into ffrench this letter, whereof
yo=w= may iustly say you haue the English originall, and to shewe it him
and desire him to reade it, as well as shee did his last whole letter
at length to La Fontaine of y=e= xii {COM:date?} of Sept: from Lyons,
to w=ch= this is an aunswere, <P_271> w=ch= was delyvered her even y=e=
same day that L'omynie arrived.  RCECIL-E2-P2,271.6

And because it is here reported, that his Secretaries only reade his
letters, and that he hath but y=e= substance giuen him of yea, or noe ;
yo=w= shal doe y=e= Queene good service if yo=w= handle it so finelie
as that it may be all readd by himself and in tyme: RCECIL-E2-P2,271.7

for tomorrowe L'omynie hath his dispatche, RCECIL-E2-P2,271.8

and $will $be {TEXT:wilbe} gonne Post, RCECIL-E2-P2,271.9

but I hope this man wil $overryde {COM:over_ryde} him.
RCECIL-E2-P2,271.10

Yo=w= must conceale y=e= effect of yo=r= letter till yo=w= may speake
w=th= y=e= king, and say that yo=w= haue heard L'omynie is sicke,
or some such thing to make him greedie to speake w=th= yo=w= first.
RCECIL-E2-P2,271.11

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} send yo=w= y=e= letter w=ch= y=e= king wrytt
to La ffontain, RCECIL-E2-P2,271.12

but theise are y=e= heddes in this Paper inclosed.  RCECIL-E2-P2,271.13

I haue represented to y=e= Q. the extremities yo=w= are in,
RCECIL-E2-P2,271.14

and I hope yo=ur= returne will nowe approache, RCECIL-E2-P2,271.15

for y=e= Q. will send an Ambassado=r= to y=e= kinge,
RCECIL-E2-P2,271.16

M=r= Edmondes.  Her ma=tie= having vnderstood very latelie that Mons=r=
Lominye, laie long at y=e= seaside, did cause enquirie to be made, what
might be y=e= occasion: whervppon she hath vnderstoode that he was staied,
partlie by contrarie windes, and also for want of a shipp to wafte him
over: RCECIL-E2-P2,279.28

And therfore her ma=tie= suspecting by y=e= mannor of his sower and sullen
carriag here, That he $will $be {TEXT:wilbe} as apt, to make y=e= worste
of all thinges there, hath nowe Comanded me expresslie to assure yo=w=
, That whatsoever impedyment he did find besides the aduerse wyndes,
was merely w=th=out her ma=ties= knowledge, or any sett purpose, of any
of her mynisters.  RCECIL-E2-P2,279.29

Yo=w= shall therfore vnderstand.  That vppon y=e= departure of S=r=
Ha: Palmer w=th= dyverse of her ma=ties= shippes to y=e= westwardes,
that small remaine left in y=e= narrowe seas of shippes and Pynnaces was
commanded to attend y=e= wafting of her ma=ties= merchantes shippes to
myddleburghe, and other places, more precisely then vusually they did.
W=ch= order was nowe y=e= rather taken for that my lo: Admirall hath ben
informed That his men that were Cap=ens= of y=e shippes did make their
pryvate gaine of wafting over $almost every com~on Passenger; so as it
may well be, that $because Mons=r= Lomynie at his comming to Rye, had
not some letter from my l. Adm=rll= of dyreccon~ to any of y=e=
Cap=ens= there: for w=ch= my L. Adm=rll= assures her may=tie=
that Mons=r= L'omynie never voutsafed so much as to send to him to
demaunde it, that he might be denyed to be receaved: RCECIL-E2-P2,279.30

for otherwise her ma=tie= would haue yo=w= make it knowen, That shee
holdes to great a Respect to y=e= ffr. king, and knowes to well
what belonges to her owne honor to haue denyed a publyke ministers
{COM:sic} such a favour.  RCECIL-E2-P2,279.31

And therefore her ma=tie= Req=ts= yo=w=, even w=th= great dexteritie and
discreccon~, both to anticipat and aunswere such reportes contryved by
him or any other, of any ill Treatem=t= vsed towardes him, wherin yo=w=
may add, That her ma=tie= hath bestowed to many offices of kyndnes
vppon y=e= king nowe to darken or shaddowe y=e= same, w=th= any such
trifling accident.  RCECIL-E2-P2,279.32

This being all I haue for y=e= present fytt to wryte vnto yo=w=, I
will here make an end, having labored as much to my small power for the
Reliefe of yo=r= particuler, as any friend yo=w= haue, whereof I haue
good Testimony, RCECIL-E2-P2,279.33

<P_280>

and I doe hope vppon y=e= comming over of some Embassado=rs= of her
ma=tie= that yo=w= shall find contentment.  RCECIL-E2-P2,280.35
