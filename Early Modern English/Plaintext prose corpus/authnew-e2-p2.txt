1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.6

And in those dayes when the number of the Disciples was multiplied, there
arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrewes, because their
widowes were neglected in the daily ministration.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.7

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.8

Then the twelue called the multitude of the disciples vnto them,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.9

and said, It is not reason that we should leaue the word of God, and
serue tables.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.10

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.11

Wherefore brethren, looke ye out among you seuen men of honest report,
full of the holy Ghost, and wisedome, whom we may appoint ouer this
businesse.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.12

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.13

But we will giue our selues continually to prayer, and to the ministerie
of the word.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.14

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.15

And the saying pleased the whole multitude: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.16

and they chose Steuen, a man full of faith and of the holy Ghost,
and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Permenas, and
Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch.  6 Whom they set before the Apostles :
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.17

and when they had praied, they layd their hands on them.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.18

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.19

And the word of God encreased, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.20

and the number of the Disciples multiplied in Hierusalem greatly,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.21

and a great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.22

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.23

And Steuen full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among
the people.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.24

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.25

Then there arose certaine of the Synagogue, which is called the <font>
Synagogue <$$font> of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians
, and of them of Cilicia, and of Asia, disputing with Steuen.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.26

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.27

And they were not able to resist the wisedome and the spirit by which
he spake.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.28

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.29

Then they suborned men which said, We haue heard him speake blasphemous
words against Moses, and against God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.30

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.31

And they stirred vp the people, and the Elders, and the Scribes,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.32

and came vpon him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.33

and caught him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.34

and brought him to the Councell, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.35

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.36

And set vp false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to
speake blasphemous words against this holy place, and the Law.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.37

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.38

For we haue heard him say, that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy
this place, & shall change the Customes which Moses deliuered vs.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.39

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.40

And all that sate in the Councell, looking stedfastly on him, saw his
face as it had bene the face of an Angel.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,6,1A.41

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.47

Then said the high Priest, Are these things so?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.48

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.49

And hee said, Men, brethren, and fathers hearken: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.50

The God of glory appeared vnto our father Abraham, when he was in
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.51

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.52

And said vnto him, Get thee out of thy countrey, and from thy kinred,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.53

and come into the land which I shall shew thee.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.54

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.55

Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.56

and dwelt in Charran: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.57

and from thence, when his father was dead, he remoued him into this
lande wherein ye now dwell.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.58

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.59

And he gaue him none inheritance in it, no not <font> so much as <$$font>
to set his foote on: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.60

yet he promised that he would giue it to him for a possession, and to
his seed after him, when as yet he had no child AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.61

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.62

And God spake on this wise, that his seede should soiourne in a strange
land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and intreate them
euill foure hundreth yeeres.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.63

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.64

And the nation to whom they shal bee in bondage, will I iudge, saide God:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.65

And after that shall they come forth, and serue me in this place.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.66

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.67

And he gaue him the couenant of Circumcision: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.68

and so <font> Abraham <$$font> begate Isaac, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.69

and circumcised him the eight day: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.70

and Isaac <font> begate <$$font> Iacob, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.71

and Iacob <font> begate <$$font> the twelue Patriarchs.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.72

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.73

And the Patriarchs moued with enuie, sold Ioseph into Egypt:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.74

but God was with him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.75

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.76

And deliuered him out of all his afflictions, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.77

and gaue him fauour and wisedome in the sight of Pharao king of Egypt:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.78

and he made him gouernour ouer Egypt and all his house.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.79

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.80

Now there came a dearth ouer all the land of Egypt, and Chanaan, and
great affliction, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.81

and our fathers found no sustenance.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.82

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.83

But when Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt, he sent out our
fathers first.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.84

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.85

And at the second <font> time <$$font> Ioseph was made knowen to his
brethren, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.86

and Iosephs kinred was made knowen vnto Pharao.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.87

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.88

Then sent Ioseph, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.89

and called his father Iacob to him, and all his kinred, threescore and
fifteene soules.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.90

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.91

So Iacob went downe into Egyt, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.92

and died, he and our fathers, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.93

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.94

And were caried ouer into Sichem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham
bought for a summe of money of the sonnes of Emor <font> the father
<$$font> of Sichem.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.95

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.96

But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworne to
Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 18 Till another king
arose, which knew not Ioseph.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.97

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.98

The same dealt subtilly with our kinred, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,1A.99

and euill intreated our fathers, so that they cast out their yong
children, to the end they might not liue.  <P_7,20A> 20 In which time
Moses was borne, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.100

and was exceeding faire, and nourished vp in his fathers house three
moneths: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.101

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.102

And when he was cast out, Pharaohs daughter tooke him vp,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.103

and nourished him for her owne sonne.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.104

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.105

And Moses was learned in all the wisedome of the Egyptians,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.106

and was mightie in words and in deeds.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.107

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.108

And when he was full forty yeres old, it came into his hear to visit
his brethren the children of $Israel.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.109

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.110

And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.111

and auenged him that was oppressed, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.112

and smote the Egyptian: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.113

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.114

For he supposed his brethren would haue vnderstood, how that God by his
hand would deliuer them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.115

but they vnderstood not.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.116

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.117

And the next day he shewed himselfe unto them as they stroue,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.118

and would haue set them at one againe, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren ,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.119

Why doe yee wrong one to another?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.120

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.121

But hee that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made
thee a ruler and a Iudge ouer vs?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.122

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.123

Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.124

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.125

Then fled Moses at this saying, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.126

and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begate two sonnes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.127

30 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.128

And when fourtie yeeres were expired, there appeared to him in the
wildernes of mount Sina, an Angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in
a bush.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.129

31 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.130

When Moses saw it, he wondred at the sight: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.131

and as he drew neere to behold it, the voyce of the Lord came vnto him, 32
<font> Saying <$$font>, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.132

Then Moses trembled, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.133

and durst not behold.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.134

33 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.135

Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shooes from thy feet:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.136

for the place where thou standest, is holy ground.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.137

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.138

I haue seene, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.139

I haue seene the affliction of my people which is in Egypt,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.140

and I haue heard their groning, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.141

& am come downe to deliuer them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.142

And now come, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.143

I will send thee into Egypt.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.144

35 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.145

This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a Iudge ?
the same did God send to bee a ruler and a deliuerer, by the handes of
the Angel which appeared to him in the bush.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.146

36 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.147

He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signes in the
land of Egypt, and in the red Sea, and in the wildernesse fortie yeeres.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.148

37 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.149

This is that Moses which said vnto the children of Israel, A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise vp vnto you of your brethren, like vnto
mee: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.150

him shall ye heare.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.151

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.152

This is he that was in y=e= Church in the wildernesse with the Angel ,
which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who receiued
the liuely oracles, to giue vnto vs.  39 To whom our fathers would not
obey, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.153

but thrust <font> him <$$font> from them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,20A.154

and in their hearts turned backe againe into Egypt, <P_7,40A> 40 Saying
vnto Aaron, Make vs gods to goe before vs.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.155

For as for this Moses, which brought vs out of the land of Egypt, we
wote not what is become of him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.156

41 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.157

And they made a calfe in those dayes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.158

and offered sacrifice vnto the idole, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.159

and reioyced in the workes of their owne hands.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.160

42 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.161

Then God turned, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.162

and gaue them vp to worship the hoste of heauen, as it is written in the
booke of the Prophets, O ye house of Israel, haue ye offered to me slaine
beasts, and sacrifices, by the space of fourty yeeres in the wildernesse?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.163

43 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.164

Yea, ye tooke vp the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of your God
Remphan, figures which ye made, to worship them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.165

and I will carie you away beyond Babylon.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.166

44 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.167

Our fathers had the Tabernacle of witnesse in the wildernesse, as hee
had appointed, speaking vnto Moses, that he should make it according
to the fashion that he had seene.  45 Which also our fathers that came
after, brought in with Iesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom
God draue out before the face of our fathers, vnto the dayes of Dauid,
46 Who found fauour before God, and desired to find a Tabernacle for
the God of Iacob.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.168

47 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.169

But Solomon built him an house.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.170

48 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.171

Howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith
the Prophet, 49 Heauen is my throne, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.172

and earth is my footestoole: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.173

What house will ye build me, saith the Lord?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.174

Or what is the place of my rest?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.175

50 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.176

Hath not my hand made all these things?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.177

51 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.178

Ye stifnecked and vncircumcised in heart, and eares, ye doe alwayes
resist the holy Ghost?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.179

as your fathers did, <font> so <$$font> doe ye.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.180

52 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.181

Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.182

And they haue slaine them which shewed before of the comming of the Iust
one, of whom ye haue bene now the betrayers and murderers: 53 Who haue
receiued the Lawe by the disposition of Angels, and haue not kept it.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.183

54 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.184

When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.185

and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.186

55 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.187

But hee being full of the holy Ghost, looked vp stedfastly into heauen ,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.188

and saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing on the right hand of God,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.189

56 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.190

And said, Behold, I see the heauens opened, and the Sonne of man standing
on the right hand of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.191

57 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.192

Then they cried out with a loud voice, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.193

and stopped their eares, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.194

and ran vpon him with one accord, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.195

58 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.196

And cast him out of the citie, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.197

and stoned him: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.198

and the witnesses layd downe their clothes at a yong mans feete, whose
name was Saul.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.199

59 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.200

And they stoned Steuen, calling <font> vpon God <$$font>, and saying,
Lord Iesus receiue my spirit.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,40A.201

<P_7,60A>

60 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,60A.203

And he kneeled downe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,60A.204

and cried with a loud voice, Lord lay not this sinne to their charge.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,60A.205

And when he had said this, he fell asleepe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,7,60A.206

CHAP. VIII.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.209

<$$heading>

{COM:introduction_omitted}

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.212

And Saul was consenting vnto his death.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.213

And at that time there was a great persecution against the Church which
was at Hierusalem, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.214

and they were all scattered abroad through out the regions of Iudea,
and Samaria, except the Apostles.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.215

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.216

And deuout men carried Steuen <font> to his buriall <$$font>,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.217

and made great lamentation ouer him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.218

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.219

As for Saul, he made hauocke of the Church, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.220

entring into euery house, and hailing men and women, committed them
to prison.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.221

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.222

Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went euery where preaching
the word.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.223

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.224

Then Philip went downe to the citie of Samaria, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.225

and preached Christ vnto them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.226

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.227

And the people with one accord gaue heed vnto those things which
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.228

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.229

For vncleane spirits, crying with lowd voyce, came out of many that were
possessed with them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.230

and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.231

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.232

And there was great ioy in that citie.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.233

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.234

But there was a certaine man called Simon, which before time in the same
citie vsed sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giuing out
that himselfe was some great one.  10 To whom they all gaue heed from
the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.235

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.236

And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched
them with sorceries.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.237

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.238

But when they beleeued Philip preaching the things concerning the
kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized,
both men and women.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.239

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.240

Then Simon himselfe beleeued also: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.241

and when hee was baptized, hee continued with Philip,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.242

and wondered, beholding the miracles and signes which were done.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.243

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.244

Now when the Apostles which were at Hierusalem, heard that Samaria had
receiued the word of God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn.  15 Who
when they were come downe, praied for them that they might receiue the
holy Ghost.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.245

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.246

<paren> For as yet hee was fallen vpon none of them:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.247

onely they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.  <$$paren>
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.248

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.249

Then layde they their hands on them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.250

and they receiued the holy Ghost.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.251

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.252

And when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands, the holy
Ghost was giuen, hee offered them money, 19 Saying, Giue me also this
power, that on whomsoeuer I lay handes, hee may receiue the holy Ghost.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,1A.253

<P_8,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.255

But Peter said vnto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.256

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.257

Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.258

for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.259

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.260

Repent therefore of this thy wickednesse, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.261

and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.262

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.263

For I perceiue that thou art in the gall of bitternesse, and in the bond
of iniquitie.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.264

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.265

Then answered Simon, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.266

and said, Pray ye to the Lord for mee, that none of these things which
ye haue spoken, come vpon me.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.267

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.268

And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord,
returned to Hierusalem, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.269

and preached the Gospel in many villages of the Samaritanes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.270

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.271

And the Angel of the Lord spake vnto Philip, saying, Arise,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.272

and goe toward the South, vnto the way that goeth downe from Hierusalem
vnto Gaza, which is desert.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.273

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.274

And hee arose, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.275

and went: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.276

and behold, a man of Ethiopia, an Eunuch of great authority vnder
Candace queene of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her
treasure, and had come to Hierusalem for to worship, 28 Was returning ,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.277

and sitting in his charet, read Esaias the Prophet.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.278

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.279

Then the Spirit saide vnto Philip, Goe neere, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.280

and ioyne thy selfe to this charet.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.281

30 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.282

And Philip ran thither to him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.283

and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.284

and said, Vnderstandest thou what thou readest?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.285

31 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.286

And hee said, How can I, except some man should guide me?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.287

And he desired Philip, that hee would come vp, and sit with him.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.288

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.289

The place of the Scripture, which hee read, was this, Hee was led as a
sheepe to the slaughter, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.290

& like a Lambe dumbe before the shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.291

33 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.292

In his humiliation, his Iudgement was taken away: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.293

and who shall declare his generation?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.294

For his life is taken from the earth.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.295

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.296

And the Eunuch answered Philip, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.297

and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the Prophet this?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.298

of himselfe, or of some other man?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.299

35 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.300

Then Philip opened his mouth, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.301

and began at the same Scripture, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.302

and preached vnto him Iesus.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.303

36 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.304

And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.305

and the Eunuch said, See, here is water, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.306

what doeth hinder me to be baptized?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.307

37 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.308

And Philip said, If thou beleeuest with all thine heart, thou mayest.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.309

And he answered, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.310

and said, I beleeue that Iesus Christ is the Sonne of God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.311

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.312

And he commanded the charet to stand still: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.313

and they went downe both into the water, both Philip, and the Eunuch,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.314

and he baptized him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.315

39 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.316

And when they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught
away Philip, that the Eunuch saw him no more: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.317

and hee went on his way reioycing.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,20A.318

<P_8,40A>

40 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,40A.320

But Philip was found at Azotus: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,8,40A.321

and passing thorow he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.328

And Saul yet breathing out threatnings & slaughter against the disciples
of the Lord, went vnto the high Priest, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.329

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.330

And desired of him letters to Damascus, to the Synagogues, that if hee
found any of this way, whether they were men or women, hee might bring
them bound vnto Hierusalem.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.331

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.332

And as he iourneyed he came neere Damascus, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.333

and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heauen.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.334

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.335

And he fel to the earth, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.336

and heard a voice saying vnto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.337

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.338

And he said, Who art thou Lord?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.339

And the Lord said, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.340

It is hard for thee to kicke against the prickes.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.341

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.342

And he trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou haue mee
to doe?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.343

And the Lord said vnto him, Arise, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.344

and goe into the citie, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.345

and it shall be told thee what thou must doe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.346

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.347

And the men which iourneyed with him, stood speechlesse, hearing a voice,
but seeing no man.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.348

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.349

And Saul arose from the earth, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.350

and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.351

but they led him by the hand, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.352

and brought him into Damascus.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.353

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.354

And he was three dayes without sight, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.355

and neither did eate, nor drinke.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.356

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.357

And there was a certaine disciple at Damascus, named Ananias,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.358

and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.359

And he said, Behold, I <font> am here <$$font>, Lord.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.360

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.361

And the Lord said vnto him, Arise, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.362

and goe into the street, which is called Straight, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.363

and inquire in the house of Iudas, for one called Saul of Tarsus:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.364

for behold, he prayeth, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.365

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.366

And hath seene in a vision a man named Ananias, comming in, and putting
his hand on him, that he might receiue his sight.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.367

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.368

Then Ananias answered, Lord, I haue heard by many of this man, how much
euill hee hath done to thy Saints at Hierusalem: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.369

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.370

And here he hath authoritie from the chiefe Priests, to binde all that
call on thy Name.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.371

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.372

But the Lord said vnto him, Goe thy way: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.373

for hee is a chosen vessell vnto me, to beare my Name before the Gentiles
, and Kings, and the children of Israel.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.374

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.375

For I will shew him how great things hee must suffer for my Names sake.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.376

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.377

And Ananias went his way, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.378

and entred into the house, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.379

and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord <paren>
euen Iesus that appeared vnto thee in the way as thou camest <$$paren>
hath sent me, that thou mightest receiue thy sight, and be filled with
the holy Ghost.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.380

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.381

And immediatly there fell from his eyes as it had bene scales,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.382

and he receiued sight forthwith, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.383

and arose, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.384

and was baptized.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.385

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.386

And when hee had receiued meat, he was strengthened.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.387

Then was Saul certaine dayes with the disciples which were at Damascus.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,1A.388

<P_9,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.390

And straightway hee preached Christ in the Synagogues, that hee is the
Sonne of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.391

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.392

But all that heard him, were amazed, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.393

and said, Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this Name
in Hierusalem, and came hither for that intent that he might bring them
bound vnto the chiefe Priests?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.394

But Saul increased the more in strength, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.395

and confounded the Iewes which dwelt at Damascus, proouing that this is
very Christ.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.396

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.397

And after that many dayes were fulfilled, the Iewes tooke counsel to
kill him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.398

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.399

But their laying awaite was knowen of Saul: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.400

and they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.401

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.402

Then the disciples tooke him by night, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.403

and let him downe by the wall in a basket.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.404

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.405

And when Saul was come to Hierusalem, he assayed to ioyne himselfe to
the disciples, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.406

but they were all afraid of him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.407

and beleeued not that he was a disciple.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.408

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.409

But Barnabas tooke him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.410

and brought him to the Apostles, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.411

and declared vnto them how hee had seene the Lord in the way, and that
hee had spoken to him, and how hee had preached boldly at Damascus in
the Name of Iesus.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.412

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.413

And he was with them comming in, and going out at Hierusalem.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.414

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.415

And he spake boldly in the Name of the Lord Iesus; AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.416

and disputed against the Grecians: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.417

but they went about to slay him.  30 Which when the brethren knewe,
they brought him downe to Cesarea, and sent him foorth to Tarsus.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.418

31 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.419

Then had the Churches rest thorowout all Iudea, and Galilee, and Samaria,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.420

and were edified, and walking in the feare of the Lord,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.421

and in the comfort of the holy Ghost, were multiplied.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.422

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.423

And it came to passe, as Peter passed thorowout all quarters, he came
downe also to the Saints, which dwelt at Lydda.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.424

33 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.425

And there he found a certaine man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed
eight yeeres, and was sicke of the palsie.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.426

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.427

And Peter said vnto him, Aeneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.428

arise, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.429

and make thy bed.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.430

And he arose immediately.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.431

35 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.432

And all that dwelt at Lydda, and Saron, saw him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.433

and turned to the Lord.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.434

36 Now there was at Ioppa a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.435

This woman was full of good works, and almes deeds, which she did.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.436

37 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.437

And it came to passe in those dayes that she was sicke, and died:
whome when they had washed, they laid her in an vpper chamber,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.438

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.439

And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Ioppa, and the disciples had heard
that Peter was there, they sent vnto him two men, desiring him that he
would not delay to come to them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.440

39 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.441

Then Peter arose AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.442

and went with them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.443

when he was come, they brought him into the vpper chamber:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.444

And all the widowes stood by him weeping, and shewing the
coats and garments which Dorcas made, while shee was with them.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,20A.445

<P_9,40A>

40 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.447

But Peter put them all forth, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.448

and kneeled downe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.449

and prayed, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.450

and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha, arise.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.451

And she opened her eyes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.452

and when she saw Peter, she sate vp.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.453

41 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.454

And he gaue her his hand, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.455

and lift her vp: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.456

and when hee had called the Saints & widowes, presented her aliue.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.457

42 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.458

And it was knowen thorowout all Ioppa, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.459

and many beleeued in the Lord.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.460

43 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.461

And it came to passe, that he taried many dayes in Ioppa, with one Simon
a Tanner.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,9,40A.462

There was a certaine man in Cesarea, called Cornelius, a Centurion of
y=e= band called the Italian band, 2 A deuout man, and one that feared
God with all his house, which gaue much almes to the people, and prayed
to God alway.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.469

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.470

He saw in a vision euidently, about the ninth houre of the day,
an Angel of God comming in to him, and saying vnto him, Cornelius.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.471

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.472

And when he looked on him, hee was afraid, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.473

and said, What is it, Lord?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.474

And he said vnto him, Thy praiers and thine almes are come vp for a
memorial before God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.475

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.476

And now send men to Ioppa, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.477

and call for one Simon, whose sirname is Peter.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.478

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.479

Hee lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whose house is by the Sea side;
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.480

he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.481

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.482

And when the Angel which spake vnto Cornelius, was departed, he called
two of his houshold seruants, and a deuout souldier of them that waited
on him continually.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.483

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.484

And when he had declared all these things vnto them, he sent them
to Ioppa.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.485

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.486

On the morrow as they went on their iourney, and drew nigh vnto the
citie, Peter went vp vpon the house to pray, about the sixth houre.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.487

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.488

And he became very hungry, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.489

and would haue eaten: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.490

But while they made ready, he fell into a traunce, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.491

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.492

And saw heauen opened, and a certaine vessell descending vnto him, as
it had beene a great sheete, knit at the foure corners, and let downe
to the earth: 12 Wherein were all maner of foure footed beasts of the
earth, and wilde beasts, and creeping things, and foules of the ayre.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.493

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.494

And there came a voyce to him, Rise, Peter: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.495

kill, and eate.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.496

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.497

But Peter said, Not so, Lord; AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.498

for I haue neuer eaten any thing that is common or vncleane.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.499

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.500

And the voice spake vnto him againe the second time,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.501

What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.502

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.503

This was done thrise: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.504

& the vessel was receiued vp againe into heauen.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.505

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.506

Now while Peter doubted in himselfe what this vision which he had seene,
should meane: behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had made
inquirie for Simons house, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.507

and stood before the gate, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.508

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.509

And called, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.510

and asked whether Simon, which was sirnamed Peter, were lodged there.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.511

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.512

While Peter thought on the vision, the spirit said vnto him, Behold,
three men seeke thee.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,1A.513

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.515

Arise therefore, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.516

and get thee downe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.517

and goe with them, doubting nothing: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.518

for I haue sent them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.519

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.520

Then Peter went downe to the men, which were sent vnto him from Cornelius
, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.521

and said, Behold, I am hee, whom ye seeke: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.522

what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.523

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.524

And they saide, Cornelius the Centurion, a iust man, and one that
feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Iewes,
was warned from God by an holy Angel, to send for thee into his house,
and to heare words of thee.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.525

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.526

Then called he them in, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.527

and lodged them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.528

And on the morrowe Peter went away with them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.529

and certaine brethren from Ioppa acco~panied him.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.530

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.531

And the morrow after they entred into Cesarea: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.532

and Cornelius waited for them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.533

and had called together his kinsmen and neere friends.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.534

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.535

And as Peter was comming in, Cornelius met him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.536

and fell downe at his feete, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.537

and worshipped him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.538

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.539

But Peter tooke him vp, saying, Stand vp; AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.540

I my selfe also am a man.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.541

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.542

And as he talked with him, hee went in, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.543

and found many that were come together.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.544

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.545

And he said vnto them, Ye know how that it is an vnlawfull thing for a
man that is a Iewe, to keepe company or come vnto one of another nation
: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.546

but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man common or vncleane.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.547

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.548

Therfore came I vnto you without gainesaying, as soone as I was sent for.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.549

I aske therefore, for what intent ye haue sent for me.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.550

30 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.551

And Cornelius said, Foure daies agoe I was fasting vntill this houre,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.552

and at the ninth houre I prayed in my house, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.553

and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.554

31 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.555

And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.556

and thine almes are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.557

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.558

Send therfore to Ioppa, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.559

and call hither Simon, whose sirname is Peter; AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.560

he is lodged in the house of one Simon a Tanner, by the Sea side, who
when he cometh, shall speake vnto thee.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.561

33 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.562

Immediately therefore I sent to thee, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.563

and thou hast well done, that thou art come.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.564

Now therefore are we all heere present before God, to heare all things
that are comanded thee of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.565

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.566

Then Peter opened his mouth, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.567

and said, Of a trueth I perceiue y=t= God is no respecter of persons:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.568

35 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.569

But in euery nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousnesse,
is accepted with him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.570

36 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.571

The word which God sent vnto the children of Israel, preaching peace
by Iesus Christ <paren> he is Lord of all.  <$$paren> 37 That word
<paren> I say <$$paren> you knowe which was published throwout all
Iudea, and began from Galilee, after the baptisme which Iohn preached:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.572

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.573

How God anointed Iesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost, and with power,
who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
deuill: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.574

for God was with him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.575

39 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.576

And we are witnesses of all things which hee did both in the land of
the Iewes, and in Hierusalem, whom they slew and hanged on a tree,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,20A.577

<P_10,40A>

40 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.579

Him God raised vp the third day, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.580

and shewed him openly, 41 Not to all the people, but vnto witnesses,
chosen before of God, euen to vs who did eate and drinke with him after
he rose from the dead.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.581

42 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.582

And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie that
it is he which was ordeined of God to be the Iudge of quicke and dead.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.583

43 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.584

To him giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name
whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.585

44 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.586

While Peter yet spake these words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which
heard the word.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.587

45 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.588

And they of the circumcision which beleeued, were astonished, as many
as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was powred out
the gift of the holy Ghost.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.589

46 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.590

For they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.591

Then answered Peter, 47 Can any man forbid water, that these should
not bee baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghost, as well as wee?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.592

48 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.593

And hee commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.594

Then prayed they him to tarie certaine dayes.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,10,40A.595

{COM:introduction_omitted}

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.601

And the Apostles, and brethren that were in Iudea, heard that the Gentiles
had also receiued the word of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.602

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.603

And when Peter was come vp to Hierusalem, they that were of the
circumcision contended with him, 3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men
vncircumcised, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.604

& didst eate with them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.605

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.606

But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.607

and expounded it by order vnto them, saying, 5 I was in the citie of
Ioppa praying, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.608

and in a trance I saw a vision, a certaine vessell descend, as it
had beene a great sheete, let downe from heauen by foure corners,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.609

and it came euen to me.  6 Vpon the which when I had fastened mine eyes,
I considered, and saw foure footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts ,
and creeping things, and foules of the aire.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.610

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.611

And I heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Arise Peter, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.612

slay, and eate.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.613

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.614

But I said, Not so, Lord: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.615

for nothing common or vncleane hath at any time entred into my mouth.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.616

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.617

But the voyce answered me againe from heauen, What God hath cleansed,
that call not thou common.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.618

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.619

And this was done three times: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.620

and all were drawen vp againe into heauen.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.621

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.622

And behold, immediately there were three men already come vnto the house
where I was, sent from Cesarea vnto me.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.623

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.624

And the spirit bad me goe with them, nothing doubting:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.625

Moreouer, these sixe brethren accompanied me, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.626

and we entred into the mans house: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.627

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.628

And he shewed vs how hee had seene an Angell in his house, which stood
and said vnto him, Send men to Ioppa, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.629

and call for Simon, whose sirname is Peter: 14 Who shall tell thee words ,
wherby thou, and all thy house shal be saued.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.630

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.631

And as I began to speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, as {COM:it_fell}
on vs at the beginning.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.632

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.633

Then remembred I the word of the Lord, how that he said, Iohn indeede
baptized with water: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.634

but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.635

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.636

Forasmuch then as God gaue them the like gift as hee did vnto vs, who
beleeued on the Lord Iesus Christ: what was I that I could withstand God?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.637

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.638

When they heard these things, they held their peace,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.639

and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted
repentance vnto life.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.640

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.641

Now they which were scattered abroad vpon the persecution that arose about
Steuen, trauailed as farre as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching
the word to none, but vnto the Iewes onely.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,1A.642

<P_11,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.644

And some of them were men of Cyprus, and Cyrene, which when they were
come to Antioch, spake vnto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Iesus.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.645

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.646

And the hand of the Lord was with them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.647

and a great number beleeued, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.648

and turned vnto the Lord.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.649

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.650

Then tidings of these things came vnto the eares of the Church, which
was in Hierusalem: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.651

and they sent foorth Barnabas, that hee should goe as farre as Antioch.
23 Who when hee came, and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and
exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleaue vnto
the Lord.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.652

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.653

For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.654

and much people was added vnto the Lord.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.655

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.656

Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seeke Saul.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.657

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.658

And when he had found him, he brought him vnto Antioch.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.659

And it came to passe, that a whole yeere they assembled themselues with
the Church, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.660

and taught much people, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.661

and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.662

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.663

And in these dayes, came Prophets from Hierusalem vnto Antioch.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.664

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.665

And there stood vp one of them, named Agabus, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.666

and signified by the spirit, that there should be great dearth throughout
all the world: which came to passe in the dayes of Claudius Cesar.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.667

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.668

Then the disciples, euery man according to his abilitie, determined to
send reliefe vnto the brethren which dwelt in Iudea.  30 Which also they
did, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,11,20A.669

and sent it to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

{COM:introduction_omitted}

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.676

Now about that time, Herode the King stretched foorth his hands, to vexe
certaine of the Church.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.677

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.678

And he killed Iames the brother of Iohn with the sword.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.679

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.680

And because he saw it pleased the Iewes, hee proceeded further, to take
Peter also.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.681

<paren> Then were the dayes of vnleauened bread.  <$$paren>
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.682

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.683

And when hee had apprehended him, hee put him in prison,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.684

and deliuered him to foure quaternions of souldiers to keepe
him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.685

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.686

Peter therefore was kept in prison, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.687

but prayer was made without ceasing of the Church vnto God for him.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.688

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.689

And when Herode would haue brought him foorth, the same night
Peter was sleeping betweene two Souldiers, bound with two chaines,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.690

and the Keepers before the doore kept the prison.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.691

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.692

And beholde, the Angel of the Lord came vpon him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.693

and a light shined in the prison: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.694

and hee smote Peter on the side, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.695

and raised him vp, saying, Arise vp quickely.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.696

And his chaines fell off from his hands.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.697

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.698

And the Angel said vnto him, Girde thy selfe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.699

and binde on thy sandales: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.700

And so he did.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.701

And he sayth vnto him, Cast thy garment about thee,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.702

and follow me.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.703

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.704

And hee went out, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.705

and followed him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.706

and wist not that it was true which was done by the Angel:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.707

but thought he saw a vision.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.708

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.709

When they were past the first and the second ward, they came vnto the
yron gate that leadeth vnto the citie, which opened to them of his owne
accord: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.710

and they went out AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.711

and passed on thorow one streete, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.712

and foorthwith the Angel departed from him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.713

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.714

And when Peter was come to himselfe, hee said, Now I know of a suretie
, that the Lord hath sent his Angel, and hath deliuered mee out of the
hand of Herode, and from all the expectation of the people of the Iewes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.715

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.716

And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary
the mother of Iohn whose sirname was Marke, where many were gathered
together praying.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.717

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.718

And as Peter knocked at the doore of the gate, a damosell came to hearken,
named Rhoda.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.719

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.720

And when she knew Peters voice, she opened not the gate for gladnes,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.721

but ran in, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.722

and told how Peter stood before the gate.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.723

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.724

And they said vnto her, Thou art mad.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.725

But she constantly affirmed that it was euen so.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.726

Then said they, It $is {TEXT:it} his Angel.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.727

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.728

But Peter continued knocking: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.729

and when they had opened <font> the doore <$$font>, and saw him, they
were astonished.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.730

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.731

But he beckening vnto them with the hand, to hold their peace,
declared vnto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.732

And he said, Goe shew these things vnto Iames, and to the brethren.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.733

And he departed, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.734

and went into another place.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.735

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.736

Now assoone as it was day, there was no smal stirre among the souldiers,
what was become of Peter.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.737

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.738

And when Herode had sought for him, and found him not, hee examined the
keepers, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.739

and commanded that they should be put to death.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.740

And hee went downe from Iudea to Cesarea, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.741

& there abode.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,1A.742

<P_12,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.744

And Herode was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.745

but they came with one accord to him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.746

and hauing made Blastus the kings chamberlaine their friend, desired
peace, because their countrey was nourished by the kings countrey.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.747

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.748

And vpon a set day Herod arayed in royall apparell, sate vpon his throne
, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.749

and made an Oration vnto them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.750

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.751

And the people gaue a shout, <font> saying <$$font>, It is the voice of
a God, and not of a man.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.752

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.753

And immediatly the Angel of the Lord smote him, because hee gaue not
God the glory, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.754

and hee was eaten of wormes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.755

and gaue vp the ghost.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.756

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.757

But the word of God grewe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.758

and multiplied.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.759

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,12,20A.760

Nowe there were in the Church that was at Antioch, certaine Prophets and
teachers: as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen, which had bene brought vp with Herod the Tetrarch,
and Saul.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.769

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.770

As they ministred to the Lord, and fasted, the holy Ghost said, Separate
me Barnabas and Saul, for the worke whereunto I haue called them.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.771

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.772

And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their handes on them,
they sent them away.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.773

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.774

So they being sent forth by the holy Ghost, departed vnto Seleucia,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.775

and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.776

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.777

And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the
Synagogues of the Iewes: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.778

and they had also Iohn to their Minister.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.779

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.780

And when they had gone thorow the Ile vnto Paphos, they found a certaine
sorcerer, a false prophet, a Iewe, whose name was Bariesus: 7 Which
was with the deputie of the countrey Sergius Paulus, a prudent man:
who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to heare the word of God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.781

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.782

But Elymas the sorcerer <paren> for so is his name by interpretation
<$$paren> withstood them, seeking to turne away the deputy from the faith.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.783

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.784

Then Saul <paren> who also is <font> called <$$font> Paul <$$paren>
filled with the holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.785

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.786

And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischiefe, thou child of the
deuil, thou enemie of all righteousnesse, wilt thou not cease to peruert
the right wayes of the Lord?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.787

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.788

And now behold, the hand of the Lord is vpon thee, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.789

& thou shalt be blind, not seeing the Sunne for a season.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.790

And immediatly there fell on him a mist and a darkenes,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.791

and he went about, seeking some to lead him by the hand.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.792

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.793

Then the Deputie when he sawe what was done, beleeued, being astonished
at the doctrine of the Lord.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.794

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.795

Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in
Pamphylia: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.796

and Iohn departing from them, returned to Hierusalem.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.797

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.798

But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.799

and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.800

and sate downe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.801

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.802

And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the
synagogue sent vnto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye haue any
word of exhortation for the people, say on.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.803

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.804

Then Paul stood vp, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.805

and beckning with his hand, said, Men of Israel, and ye that feare God,
giue audience.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.806

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.807

The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.808

and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt
, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.809

and with an high arme brought he them out of it.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.810

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.811

And about the time of fourtie yeeres suffered he their maners in the
wildernesse.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.812

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.813

And when he had destroyed seuen nations in the land of Chanaan, he
diuided their land to them by lot: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,1A.814

<P_13,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.816

And after that he gaue vnto them iudges, about the space of foure hundred
and fifty yeeres vntill Samuel the Prophet.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.817

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.818

And afterward they desired a King, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.819

and God gaue vnto them Saul the sonne of Cis, a man of the tribe of
Beniamin, by the space of fourty yeres.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.820

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.821

And when he had remoued him, hee raised vp vnto them Dauid to be their
king, to whom also he gaue testimonie, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.822

and said, I haue found Dauid the sonne of Iesse, a man after mine own
heart; which shal fulfill all my wil.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.823

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.824

Of this mans seed hath God, according to his promise, raised vnto Israel
a Sauiour, Iesus: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.825

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.826

When Iohn had first preached before his comming, the baptisme of
repentance to all the people of Israel.  25 And as Iohn fulfilled his
course, he said, Whom thinke ye that I am?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.827

I am not he.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.828

But behold, there commeth one after me, whose shooes of his feete I am
not worthy to loose.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.829

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.830

Men and brethren, children of the stocke of Abraham, and whosoeuer
among you feareth God, to you is the word of this saluation sent.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.831

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.832

For they that dwell at Hierusalem, & their rulers, because they knew him
not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets which are read euery Sabbath day ,
they haue fulfilled them in condemning him.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.833

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.834

And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate
that he should be slaine.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.835

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.836

And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they tooke him
downe from the tree, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.837

and layd him in a Sepulchre.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.838

30 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.839

But God raised him fro~ the dead: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.840

31 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.841

And he was seene many dayes of them which came vp with him from
Galilee to Hierusalem, who are his witnesses vnto the people.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.842

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.843

And we declare vnto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made
vnto the fathers, 33 God hath fulfilled the same vnto vs their children
, in that he hath raised vp Iesus againe, as it is also written in the
second Psalme: Thou art my Sonne, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.844

this day haue I begotten thee.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.845

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.846

And as concerning that he raised him vp from the dead, now no more to
returne to corruption, he said on this wise, I will giue you the sure
mercies of Dauid.  35 Wherfore he saith also in another Psalme, Thou shalt
not suffer thine holy one to see corruption.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.847

36 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.848

For Dauid after he had serued his owne generation by the will of God,
fell on sleepe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.849

and was laide vnto his fathers, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.850

and saw corruption: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.851

37 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.852

But hee whom God raised againe, saw no corruption.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.853

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.854

Be it knowen vnto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man
is preached vnto you the forgiuenesse of sinnes.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.855

39 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.856

And by him all y=t= beleeue, are iustified from all things, from which
ye could not be iustified by the Law of Moses.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,20A.857

<P_13,40A>

40 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.859

Beware therefore, least that come vpon you which is spoken of in the
Prophets, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.860

41 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.861

Behold, yee despisers, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.862

and wonder, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.863

and perish: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.864

for I worke a worke in your dayes, a worke which you shall in no wise
beleeue, though a man declare it vnto you.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.865

42 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.866

And when the Iewes were gone out of the Synagogue, the Gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.867

43 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.868

Now when the Congregation was broken vp, many of the Iewes, and religious
Proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, perswaded
them to continue in the grace of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.869

44 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.870

And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together to heare
the word of God.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.871

45 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.872

But when the Iewes saw the multitudes, they were filled with enuie,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.873

and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting,
and blaspheming.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.874

46 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.875

Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.876

and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first haue bene
spoken to you: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.877

but seeing yee put it from you, and iudge your selues vnworthy of
euerlasting life, loe, we turne to the Gentiles.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.878

47 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.879

For so hath the Lord comanded vs, <font> saying <$$font> I haue set thee
to bee a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for saluation
vnto the ends of the earth.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.880

48 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.881

And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.882

and glorified the word of the Lord: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.883

and as many as were ordeined to eternall life, beleeued.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.884

49 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.885

And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.886

50 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.887

But the Iewes stirred vp the deuout and honourable women, and the chiefe
men of the citie, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.888

and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.889

and expelled them out of their coasts.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.890

51 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.891

But they shooke off the dust of their feete against them,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.892

and came vnto Iconium.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.893

52 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,13,40A.894

And the disciples were filled with ioy, and with the holy Ghost.

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.901

And it came to passe in Iconium, that they went both together into the
synagogue of the Iewes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.902

and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Iewes, and also of the
Greekes, beleeued.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.903

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.904

But the vnbeleeuing Iewes stirred vp the Gentiles, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.905

and made their mindes euill affected against the brethren.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.906

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.907

Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gaue
testimonie vnto the word of his grace, and granted signes and wonders
to be done by their hands.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.908

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.909

But the multitude of the city was diuided: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.910

and part held with the Iewes, and part with the Apostles.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.911

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.912

And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the
Iewes, with their rulers, to vse them despitefully, and to stone them,
6 They were ware of it, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.913

and fled vnto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and vnto the region
that lyeth round about.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.914

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.915

And there they preached the Gospell.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.916

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.917

And there sate a certaine man at Lystra, impotent in his feete,
being a creeple from his mothers wombe, who neuer had walked.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.918

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.919

The same heard Paul speake who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiuing
that he had faith to be healed, 10 Said with a lowd voice, Stand vpright
on thy feete; AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.920

And he leaped and walked.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.921

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.922

And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lift vp their voyces,
saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come downe to vs in the
likenesse of men.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.923

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.924

And they called Barnabas Iupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because hee was
the chiefe speaker.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.925

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.926

Then the priest of Iupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen,
and garlands vnto the gates, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.927

and would haue done sacrifice with the people.  14 Which when the
Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their clothes, and
ranne in among the people, crying out, 15 And saying, Sirs, Why doe yee
these things?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.928

Wee also are men of like passions with you, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.929

and preach vnto you, that ye should turne from these vanities, vnto the
liuing God, which made heauen and earth, and the sea, and all things
that are therein.  16 Who in times past, suffred all nations to walke
in their owne wayes.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.930

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.931

Neuerthelesse, he left not himselfe without witnesse, in that he did
good, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.932

and gaue vs raine from heauen, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts
with food and gladnesse.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.933

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.934

And with these sayings scarse restrained they the people, that they had
not done sacrifice vnto them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.935

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.936

And there came thither certaine Iewes from Antioch and Iconium, who
perswaded the people, and hauing stoned Paul, drew him out of the citie,
supposing he had beene dead.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,1A.937

<P_14,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.939

Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose vp,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.940

and came into the citie, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.941

and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.942

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.943

And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many ,
they returned againe to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, 22 Confirming
the soules of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith,
and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdome of God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.944

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.945

And when they had ordeined them Elders in euery Church, and had prayed
with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they beleeued.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.946

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.947

And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.948

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.949

And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went downe into
Attalia, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.950

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.951

And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended
to the grace of God, for the worke which they fulfilled.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.952

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.953

And when they were come, and had gathered the Church together, they
rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the
doore of faith vnto the Gentiles.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.954

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,14,20A.955

And there they abode long time with the disciples.

And certaine men which came downe from Iudea, taught the brethren,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.963

<font> and said <$$font>, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses, ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be saued.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.964

2 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.965

When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissention and disputation
with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certeine other
of them, should goe vp to Hierusalem vnto the Apostles and Elders about
this question.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.966

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.967

And being brought on their way by the Church, they passed thorow
Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conuersion of the Gentiles:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.968

and they caused great ioy vnto all the brethren.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.969

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.970

And when they were come to Hierusalem, they were receiued of the Church,
and of the Apostles, and Elders, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.971

and they declared all things that God had done with them.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.972

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.973

But there rose vp certaine of the sect of the Pharisees which beleeued,
saying, that it was needfull to circumcise them, and to comand them to
keepe the Law of Moses.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.974

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.975

And the Apostles & Elders came together for to consider of this matter.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.976

7 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.977

And when there had bene much disputing, Peter rose vp,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.978

and said vnto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while agoe,
God made choise among vs, that the Gentiles by my mouth should heare
the worde of the Gospel, and beleeue.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.979

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.980

And God which knoweth the hearts, bare them witnes, giuing them the holy
Ghost, euen as he did vnto vs, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.981

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.982

And put no difference between vs & them, purifying their hearts by faith.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.983

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.984

Now therfore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke vpon the necke of the
disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to beare?
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.985

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.986

But we beleeue that through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ, we shal
be saued euen as they.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.987

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.988

Then all the multitude kept silence, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.989

and gaue audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles
and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.990

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.991

And after they had helde their peace, Iames answered, saying, Men and
brethren, hearken vnto me.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.992

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.993

Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visite the Gentiles to
take out of them a people for his Name.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.994

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.995

And to this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written, 16 After
this I will returne, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.996

and, wil build againe the Tabernacle of Dauid, which is fallen downe:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.997

and I will build againe the ruines thereof, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.998

and I will set it vp 17 That the residue of men might seeke after the
Lord, and all the Gentiles, vpon whom my Name is called, sayth the Lord,
who doeth all these things.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.999

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,1A.1000

Knowen vnto God are all his workes fro~ the beginning of the world.
19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among
the Gentiles are turned to God: <P_15,20A> 20 But that wee write vnto
them, that they abstaine from pollutions of Idoles, and from fornication ,
and from things strangled, and from blood.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1001

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1002

For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preach him, being
read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1003

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1004

Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church, to send
chosen men of their owne company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas:
<font> namely <$$font>, Iudas surnamed Barsabas, & Silas, chiefe men
among the brethren, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1005

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1006

And wrote letters by them after this maner, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1007

The Apostles and Elders, and brethren, send greeting vnto the brethren
, which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1008

24 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1009

Forasmuch as we haue heard, that certaine which went out from vs, haue
troubled you with words, subuerting your soules, saying, Ye must be
circumcised, and keepe the Law, to whom we gaue no such commandement :
25 It seemed good vnto vs, being assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men vnto you, with our beloued Barnabas and Paul, 26 Men that
haue hazarded their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1010

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1011

Wee haue sent therefore Iudas and Silas, who shall also tell you the
same things by mouth.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1012

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1013

For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to vs, to lay vpon you no
greater burden then these necessarie things; 29 That ye abstaine from
meates offered to idoles, and from blood, & from things strangled, and
from fornication: from which if ye keepe your selues, yee shall doe well.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1014

Fare ye well.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1015

30 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1016

So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1017

and when they had gathered the multitude together, they deliuered the
Epistle.  31 Which when they had read, they reioyced for the consolation.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1018

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1019

And Iudas and Silas, being Prophets also themselues, exhorted the brethren
with many words, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1020

and confirmed them: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1021

33 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1022

And after they had taried there a space, they were let goe in peace from
the brethren {TEXT:breehren} vnto the Apostles.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1023

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1024

Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1025

35 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1026

Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the
word of the Lord, with many others also.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1027

36 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1028

And some dayes after, Paul said vnto Barnabas, Let vs go againe and visit
our brethren, in euery city where we haue preached the word of the Lord,
<font> and see <$$font> how they doe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1029

37 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1030

And Barnabas determined to take with them Iohn, whose surname was Marke.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1031

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1032

But Paul thought not good to take him with them; who departed
from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the worke.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1033

39 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1034

And the contention was so sharpe betweene them, that they departed
asunder one from the other: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1035

& so Barnabas tooke Marke, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1036

& sailed vnto Cyprus.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,20A.1037

<P_15,40A>

40 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,40A.1039

And Paul chose Silas, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,40A.1040

and departed, being recommended by the brethren vnto the grace of God.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,40A.1041

41 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,15,40A.1042

And he went thorow Syria and Cilicia, confirming the Churches.

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1049

Then came he to Derbe, and Lystra: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1050

and behold, a certaine disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a
certaine woman which was a Iewesse, and beleeued: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1051

but his father was a Greeke: 2 Which was well reported of by the brethren
that were at Lystra and Iconium.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1052

3 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1053

Him would Paul haue to go forth with him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1054

and tooke, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1055

and circumcised him, because of the Iewes which were in those quarters :
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1056

for they knew all, that his father was a Greeke.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1057

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1058

And as they went through the cities, they deliuered them the decrees
for to keepe, that were ordeined of the Apostles and Elders, which were
at Hierusalem.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1059

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1060

And so were the Churches established in the faith,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1061

and increased in number dayly.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1062

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1063

Now when they had gone thorowout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia
, and were forbidden of the holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to goe into Bithynia:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1064

but the Spirit suffered them not.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1065

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1066

And they passing by Mysia, came downe to Troas.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1067

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1068

And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1069

There stood a man of Macedonia, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1070

and prayed him, saying, Come ouer into Macedonia, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1071

and helpe vs.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1072

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1073

And after he had seene the vision, immediatly we endeuoured to goe into
Macedonia, assuredly gathering, that the Lord had called vs for to preach
the Gospel vnto them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1074

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1075

Therfore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis: 12 And from thence to Philippi,
which is the chiefe citie of that part of Macedonia, and a Colonie:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1076

and we were in that citie abiding certaine dayes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1077

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1078

And on the Sabboth we went out of the citie by a riuer side, where prayer
was wont to be made, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1079

& we sate downe, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1080

and spake vnto the women which resorted thither.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1081

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1082

And a certaine woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the citie
of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard vs: whose heart the Lord
opened, that she attended vnto the things which were spoken of Paul.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1083

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1084

And when she was baptized, and her houshold, she besought vs, saying,
If ye haue iudged me to bee faithfull to the Lord, come into my house,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1085

and abide there.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1086

And she constrained vs.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1087

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1088

And it came to passe, as we went to prayer, a certaine Damosell possessed
with a spirit of diuination, met vs: which brought her masters much
gaine by soothsaying.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1089

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1090

The same followed Paul and vs, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1091

and cried, saying, These men are the seruants of the most hie God,
which shew vnto vs the way of saluation.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1092

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1093

And this did she many dayes: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1094

but Paul being grieued, turned AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1095

and said to the spirit, I command thee in the Name of Iesus Christ,
to come out of her.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1096

And he came out the same houre.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1097

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1098

And when her Masters saw that the hope of their gaines was gone, they
caught Paul and Silas, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1099

and drew them into the market place, unto the rulers,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,1A.1100

<P_16,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1102

And brought them to the Magistrates, saying, These men being Iewes
, do exceedingly trouble our city, 21 And teach customes which are
not lawfull for vs to receiue, neither to obserue, being Romanes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1103

22 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1104

And the multitude rose vp together against them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1105

and the Magistrates rent off their clothes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1106

and commanded to beate them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1107

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1108

And when they had layed many stripes vpon them, they cast them into
prison, charging the Iaylour to keepe them safely.  24 Who hauing receiued
such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, & made their feet fast
in the stockes.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1109

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1110

And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1111

and sang praises vnto God: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1112

and the prisoners heard them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1113

26 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1114

And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
the prison were shaken: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1115

and immediately all the doores were opened, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1116

and euery ones bands were loosed.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1117

27 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1118

And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleepe, and seeing the
prison doores open, he drew out his sword, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1119

and would haue killed himselfe, supposing that the prisoners had beene
fled.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1120

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1121

But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Doe thy selfe no harme,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1122

for we are all heere.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1123

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1124

Then hee called for a light, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1125

and sprang in, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1126

and came trembling, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1127

and fell downe before Paul and Silas, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1128

30 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1129

And brought them out, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1130

and said, Sirs, what must I doe to be saued?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1131

31 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1132

And they saide, Beleeue on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saued,
and thy house.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1133

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1134

And they spake vnto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in
his house.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1135

33 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1136

And hee tooke them the same houre of the night, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1137

and washed their stripes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1138

and was baptized, hee and all his, straightway.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1139

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1140

And when he had brought them into his house, hee set meat before them,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1141

and reioyced, beleeuing in God with all his house.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1142

35 And when it was day, the Magistrates sent the Sergeants, saying,
Let those men goe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1143

36 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1144

And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The Magistrates
haue sent to let you goe: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1145

Now therefore depart, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1146

and goe in peace.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1147

37 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1148

But Paul said vnto them, They haue beaten vs openly vncondemned, being
Romanes, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1149

and haue cast vs into prison, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1150

and now doe they thrust vs out priuily?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1151

Nay verily, but let them come themselues, and fetch vs out.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1152

38 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1153

And the Sergeants tolde these words vnto the Magistrates:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1154

and they feared when they heard that they were Romanes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1155

39 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1156

And they came AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1157

and besought them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1158

and brought them out, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1159

and desired them to depart out of the citie.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,20A.1160

<P_16,40A>

40 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,40A.1162

And they went out of the prison, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,40A.1163

and entred into the house of Lydia, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,40A.1164

and when they had seene the brethren, they comforted them,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,40A.1165

and departed.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,16,40A.1166

{COM:introduction_omitted}

1 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1172

Now when they had passed thorow Amphipolis, and Apollonia,
they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Iewes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1173

And Paul, as his maner was, went in vnto them, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1174

and three Sabbath dayes reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,
3 Opening and alleadging, that Christ must needs haue suffered and
risen againe from the dead: and that this Iesus whom I preach vnto you,
is Christ.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1175

4 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1176

And some of them beleeued, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1177

and consorted with Paul and Silas: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1178

and of the deuout Greekes a great multitude, and of the chiefe women
not a few.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1179

5 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1180

But the Iewes which beleeued not, mooued with enuie, tooke vnto them
certaine lewd fellowes of the baser sort, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1181

and gathered a company, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1182

and set all the citie on an vprore, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1183

and assaulted the house of Iason, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1184

and sought to bring them out to the people.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1185

6 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1186

And when they found them not, they drew Iason, and certaine brethren
vnto the rulers of the citie, crying, These that haue turned the
world vpside downe, are come hither also, 7 Whom Iason hath receiued:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1187

and these all doe contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, that there
is another King, <font> one <$$font> Iesus.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1188

8 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1189

And they troubled the people, and the rulers of the citie, when they
heard these things.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1190

9 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1191

And when they had taken securitie of Iason, and of the other, they let
them goe.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1192

10 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1193

And the brethren immediatly sent away Paul and Silas by night vnto
Berea: who comming thither, went into the Synagogue of the Iewes.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1194

11 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1195

These were more noble then those in Thessalonica, in that they receiued
the word with all readinesse of minde, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1196

and searched the Scriptures dayly, whether those things were so.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1197

12 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1198

Therefore many of them beleeued: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1199

also of honourable women which were Greekes, and of men not a few.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1200

13 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1201

But when the Iewes of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1202

and stirred vp the people.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1203

14 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1204

And then immediatly the brethren sent away Paul, to goe as it were to
the sea: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1205

but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1206

15 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1207

And they that conducted Paul, brought him vnto Athens,
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1208

and receiuing a commaundement vnto Silas and Timotheus, for to come to
him with all speed, they departed.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1209

16 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1210

Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him,
when hee saw the city wholy giuen to idolatrie.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1211

17 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1212

Therefore disputed he in the Synagogue with the Iewes, and with the
deuout persons, and in the market dayly with them that met with him.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1213

18 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1214

Then certaine Philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoikes,
encountred him: AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1215

and some said, What will this babbler say?  Other some, He seemeth to be
a setter foorth of strange gods: because hee preached vnto them Iesus,
and the resurrection.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1216

19 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1217

And they tooke him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1218

and brought him vnto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new
doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,1A.1219

<P_17,20A>

20 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1221

For thou bringest certaine strange things to our eares:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1222

we would know therefore what these things meane.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1223

21 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1224

<paren> For all the Athenians and strangers which were there, spent their
time in nothing else, but either to tell or to heare some new thing.

Then Paul stood in the mids of Mars-hill, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1227

and said, Yee men of Athens, I perceiue that in all things yee are too
superstitious.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1228

23 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1229

For as I passed by, and beheld your deuotions, I found an Altar with
this inscription, TO THE VNKNOWEN GOD.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1230

Whom therefore yee ignorantly worship, him declare I vnto you.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1231

God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that hee is
Lord of heauen and earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1233

25 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1234

Neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing,
seeing hee giueth to all, life and breath, and all things, 26 And hath
made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of
the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds
of their habitation: 27 That they should seeke the Lord , if haply they
might feele after him and finde him, though he be not farre from euery
one of vs.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1235

28 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1236

For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as certaine also of
your owne Poets haue said, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1237

For we are also his offspring.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1238

29 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1239

Forasmuch then as wee are the offspring of God, wee ought not to thinke
that the Godhead is like vnto golde, or siluer, or stone grauen by arte,
and mans deuice.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1240

And the times of this ignorance God winked at, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1242

but now commandeth all men euery where to repent: 31 Because hee hath
appointed a day in the which he will iudge the world in righteousnesse, by
that man whom hee hath ordeined, whereof he hath giuen assurance vnto all
men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1243

32 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1244

And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked:
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1245

and others said, Wee will heare thee againe of this matter.
AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1246

So Paul departed from among them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1248

34 AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1249

Howbeit, certaine men claue vnto him, AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1250

and beleeued: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman
named Damaris, and others with them.  AUTHNEW-E2-P2,17,20A.1251
