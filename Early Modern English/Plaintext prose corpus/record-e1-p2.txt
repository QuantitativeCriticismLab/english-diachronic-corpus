THE THEOREMES OF GEOMETRY, BEFORE <font> WHICHE ARE SET FORTHE <$$font>
<font> CERTAINE GRAUNTABLE REQUESTES WHICHE SERUE FOR DEMONSTRATIONS
<$$font> MATHEMATICALL.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.3

<$$heading>

That fro~ any pricke to one other, there may be drawen a right line.
As for example.  {COM:figure_omitted} RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.5

A being the one pricke, and B. the other, you maye drawe betwene
them from the one to the other, that is to say, from A. vnto B,
and from B. to A. RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.6

That any right line of measurable length may be drawen forth longer,
and straight.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.7

Example of A.B, which as it is a line of measurable lengthe, so may
it be drawen forth longer, as for example vnto C, {COM:figure_omitted}
and that in true streightenes without crokinge.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.8

That vpon any centre, there may be made a circle of anye qua~titee that
a man wyll.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.9

Let the centre be set to A, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.10

{COM:figure_omitted}

what shal hinder a man to drawe a circle about it, of what quantitee
that he lusteth, as you se the forme here: other bygger or lesse, as it
shall lyke him to doo?  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1R.12

<P_2,B1V>

That all right angles be equall eche to other.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.14

Set for an example A. and B, {COM:figure_omitted} of which
two though A. seme the greater angle to some men of small
experience, it happeneth only bicause that the lines aboute A, are
longer the~ the lines about B, as you may proue by drawing them longer ,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.15

for so shal B. seme the greater angle yf you make his lines longer
then the lines that make the angle A. RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.16

And to proue it by demonstration, I say thus.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.17

If any ij. right corners be not equal, then one right corner is
greater then an other, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.18

but that corner which is greater then a right angle, is a blunt corner
<paren> by his definition <$$paren> RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.19

so must one corner be both a right corner and a blunt corner also,
whiche is not possible: RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.20

And againe: the lesser right corner must be a sharpe corner, by his
definition, bicause it is lesse then a right angle, which thing is
impossible.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.21

Therefore I conclude that all right angles be equall.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.22

Yf one right line do crosse two other right lines, and make ij.
inner corners of one side lesser the~ ij. righte corners, it is
certaine, that if those two lines be drawen forth right on that side
that the sharpe inner corners be, they wil at le~gth mete togither,
and crosse on an other.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B1V.23

The ij. lines beinge as A.B.  and C.D, and the third line crossing
them as dooth heere E.F, making ij inner $corners {TEXT:cornes} <paren>
as ar G.H.  <$$paren> lesser then two right corners, {COM:figure_omitted}
sith ech of <P_2,B2R> them is lesse then a right corner, as your eyes maye
iudge, then say I, if those ij. lines A.B.  and C.D.  be drawen
in lengthe on that side that G. and H. are, the {COM:sic}
will at length meet and crosse one an other.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.24

Two right lines make no platte forme.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.25

A platte forme, as you harde before, hath bothe length and bredthe,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.26

and is inclosed with lines as with his boundes, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.27

but ij. right lines $can $not {TEXT:cannot} inclose al the bondes
of any platte forme.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.28

Take for an example firste these two right lines AB. and A.C.
whiche meete togither in A, {COM:figure_omitted} but yet $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be called a platte forme, bicause there is no bond from
B. to C, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.29

but if you will drawe a line betwene them twoo, that is frome B.
to C, then will it be a platte forme, that is to say, a triangle,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.30

but then are there iij. lines, and not only ij.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.31

Likewise may you say of D.E.
and F.G, {COM:figure_omitted} whiche doo $not
{COM:'not'_missing_in_text,_but_required_since_the_lines_de_and_fg_are_parallel_in_the_figure}
make a platte forme, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.32

nother yet can they make any without helpe of two lines more, whereof
the one must be drawen from D. to F, and the other frome E.
to G, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.33

and then will it be a longe square.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.34

So then of two right lines can bee made no platte forme.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.35

But of ij. croked lines be made a platte forme, as you se in the
eye form.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2R.36

And also of one rightline, & one croked line, maye a platte
fourme bee made, as the semicircle F. doothe sette forth.

CERTAYN COMMON SENTENCES MANIFEST TO <font> SENCE, AND ACKNOWLEDGED OF
ALL MEN <$$font>.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.41

THE FIRSTE COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.42

<$$heading>

What so euer things be equal to one other thinge, those same bee equall
betwene them selues.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.44

Examples therof you may take both in greatnes and also in numbre.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.45

First <paren> though it pertaine not proprely to geometry, but to helpe
the vnderstandinge of the rules, whiche may bee wrought by both artes
<$$paren> thus may you perceaue.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.46

If the summe of mounye in my purse, and the mony in your purse be equall
eche of them to the mony that any other man hathe, then must needes your
mony and mine be equall togyther.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.47

Likewise, if anye ij. quantities, as A and B, be equal to an
other, as vn to C, then muste nedes A. and B. be equall
eche to other, as A. equall to B, and B. equall to A,
whiche thinge the better to peceaue, tourne these quantities into numbre
, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.48

so shall A. and B. make sixteene, and C. as many.
{COM:figure_omitted} As you may perceaue by multipliyng the numbre of
their sides togither.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.49

<heading>

THE SECONDE COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B2V.51

<$$heading>

And if you adde equall portions to thinges that be equall, what so
amounteth of them <P_2,B3R> shall be equall.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.53

Example, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.54

Yf you and I haue like summes of mony, and then receaue eche of vs like
summes more, then our summes wil be like styll.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.55

Also if A. and B. <paren> as in the former example <$$paren>
bee equall, then by adding an equal portion to them both, as to ech of
them, the quarter of A. <paren> that is foure <$$paren> they will
be equall still.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.56

<heading>

THE THIRDE COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.58

<$$heading>

And if you abate euen portions from things that are equal, those partes
that remain shall be equall also.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.60

This you may perceaue by the laste example.  For that that was added
there, is subtracted heere.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.61

and so the one doothe approue the other.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.62

<heading>

THE FOURTH COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.64

<$$heading>

If you abate equalle partes from vnequal thinges, the remainers shall
be vnequall.  As bicause that a hundreth and eight and forty be vnequal
if I take tenne from them both, there will remayne nynetye and eight
and thirty, which are also vnequall, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.66

and likewise in quantities it is to be iudged.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.67

<heading>

THE FIFTE COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.69

<$$heading>

when euen portions are added to vnequalle thinges, those that amounte
$shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} vnequall.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3R.71

<P_2,B3V>

So if you adde twenty to fifty, and lyke ways to nynty, you shall make
seuenty, and a hundred and ten whiche are no lesse vnequall, than were
fifty and nynty.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.73

<heading>

THE SYXT COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.75

<$$heading>

If two thinges be double to any other, those same two thinges are equal
togither.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.77

{COM:figures_omitted}

Bicause A. and B. are eche of them double to C,
therefore must A. and B. nedes be equall togither.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.79

For as v. times viij. maketh xl. which is double
to iiij. times v, that is xx so iiij. times x, likewise
is double to xx.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.80

<paren> for it maketh fortie <$$paren> RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.81

and therefore must neades be equall to forty.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.82

<heading>

THE SEUENTH COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.84

<$$heading>

If any two thinges be the halfes of one other thing, than are thei.ij.
equall togither.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.86

So are D. and C. in the laste example equal togyther,
bicause they are eche of them the halfe of A, other of B, as their
numbre declareth.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.87

<heading>

THE EYGHT COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B3V.89

<$$heading>

If any one quantitee be laide on an other, and thei agree, so that the
one <P_2,B4R> excedeth not the other, then are they equall togither.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.91

As if this figure A.B.C.  {COM:figure_omitted} be layed on that other
D.E.F, {COM:figure_omitted} so that A. be layed to D, B.
to E, and C. to F, you shall see them agre in sides exactlye and
the one not to excede the other, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.92

for the line A.B.  is equall to D.E, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.93

and the third lyne C.A, is equal to F.D so that euery side in the one
is equall to some one side of the other.  wherfore it is playne, that
the two triangles are equall togither.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.94

<heading>

THE NYNTH COMMON SENTENCE.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.96

<$$heading>

Euery whole thing is greater than any of his partes.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.98

This sentence nedeth none example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.99

For the thyng is more playner then any declaration, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.100

yet considering that other commen sentence that foloweth nexte that.
<heading> THE TENTHE COMMON SENTENCE.  <$$heading> Euery whole thinge is
equall to all his partes taken togither.  It shall be mete to expresse
both w=t= one example, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.101

for of thys last se~tence many me~ at the first hearing do make a doubt.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4R.102

Ther fore as in this example of the circle deuided into su~dry partes
<P_2,B4V> {COM:figure_omitted} it doeth appere that no parte can be so
great as the whole circle, <paren> accordyng to the meanyng of the eight
sentence <$$paren> so yet it is certain, that all those eight partes
together be equall vnto the whole circle.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.103

And this is the meanyng of that common sentence <paren> whiche many
vse, and fewe do rightly understand <$$paren> that is, that <font>
All the partes of any thing are nothing els, but the whole.  <$$font>
And contrary waies: <font> The whole is nothing els, but all his partes
taken togither.  <$$font> whiche saiynges some haue vnderstand to meane
thus: that all the partes are of the same kind that the whole thyng is :
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.104

but that that meanyng is false, it doth plainly appere by this figure
A.B, {COM:figure_omitted} whose partes A. and B, are triangles,
and the whole figure is a square, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.105

and so they are not of one kind.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.106

But and if they applie it to the matter or substance of thinges <paren>
as some do <$$paren> then it is moste false, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.107

for euery compound thyng is made of partes of diuerse matter and
substance.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.108

Take for example a man, a house, a boke, and all other compound thinges.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.109

Some vnderstand it thus, that the partes all together can make none
other forme, but that that the whole doth shewe, whiche is also false ,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.110

for I make fiue hundred diuerse figures of the partes of some one figure,
as you shall better perceiue in the third boke.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.111

And in the meane seaso~ take for an exa~ple this square figure folowing
A.B.C.D, {COM:figures_on_next_page_omitted} w=ch= is deuided but into
two parts, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.112

and yet <paren> as you se <$$paren> I haue made fiue figures more
beside the firste, with onely diuerse ioynyng of those two partes.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.113

But of this shall I speake more largely in an other place,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.114

in the mean season content your self with these principles, whiche are
certain of the chiefe groundes wheron all demonstrations mathematical are
fourmed of which though the moste parte seeme so plaine, that no childe
doth doubte of them, thinke not therfore that the art vnto whiche they
serue, is simple, other childishe, RECORD-E1-P2,2,B4V.115

but rather consider, howe certayne <P_2,C1R> the profes of that arte
is, y=t= hath for his grou~des soche playne truthes, & as I may say,
such vndowbtfull and sensible principles, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1R.116

And this is the cause why all learned menne dooth approue the certenty of
geometry, and co~sequently of the other artes mathematical, which haue
the grounds <paren> as Arithmetike, musike and astronomy <$$paren>
aboue all other artes and sciences, that be vsed amo~gest men.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1R.117

This muche haue I sayd of the first principles, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1R.118

and now will I go on with the theoremes, whiche I do only by examples
declae {COM:sic}, minding to reserue the proofes to a peculiar boke which
I will then set forth, when I perceaue this to be thankfully taken of

RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1R.121

<$$heading>

<heading>

THE FIRSTE THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1R.124

<$$heading>

When.ij.  triangles be so drawen, that the one of the~ hath ij.
sides equal to ij sides of the <P_2,C1V> other triangle, and that the
angles enclosed with those sides, bee equal also in bothe triangles,
then is the thirde side likewise equall in them.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.126

And the whole triangles be of one greatnes, and euery angle in the one
equall to his matche angle in the other, I meane those angles that be
inclosed with like sides.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.127

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.129

<$$font>

This triangle A.B.C.  hath ij. sides <paren> that is to say
<$$paren> C.A.  and C.B, equal to ij. sides of the other triangle
F.G.H, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.131

{COM:figures_omitted}

for A.C.  is equall to F.G, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.133

and B.C.  is equall to G.H.  And also the angle C. contayned
beetweene F.G, and G.H, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.134

for both of them answere to the eight parte of a circle.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.135

Ther fore doth it remayne that A.B.  whiche is the thirde lyne in the
firste triangle, doth agre in lengthe with F.H, w=ch= is the third line
in $y=e= $seco~d {TEXT:y=e=se_co~d} tria~gle & y=t= hole tria~gle A.B.C.
must nedes be equal to y=e= hole triangle F.G.H.  And euery corner equall
to his match, that is to say, A. equall to F, B. to H,
and C. to G, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.136

for those bee called <font> match corners <$$font>, which are
inclosed with like sides, other els do lye against like sides.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.137

<heading>

THE SECOND THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C1V.139

<$$heading>

In twileke triangles the ij. corners that be <P_2,C2R> about the
groud {COM:sic} line, are equal togither.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.141

And if the sides that be equal, be drawe~ out in le~gth the~ wil
the corners that are vnder the ground lines, be equal also togither.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.142

<font>

Example RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.144

<$$font>

A.B.C.  is a twileke triangle, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.146

for the one side A.C, is equal to the other side B.C.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.147

{COM:figure_omitted}

And therfore I saye that the inner corners A. and B, which
are about the ground lines, <paren> that is A.B.  <$$paren> be equall
to gither.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.149

And farther if C.A.  and C.B.  bee drawen forthe vnto D and E. as
you se that I haue drawen them, then saye I that the two vtter angles
vnder A. and B, are equal also togither: as the theorem said.
The profe wherof, as of al the rest, shal apeare in Euclide, whome I
intende to set foorth in english with sondry new additions, if I may
perceaue that it wil be thankfully taken.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.150

THE THIRDE THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.152

If in annye triangle there bee twoo angles equall togither, then
shall the sides, that lie against those angles, be equal also.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.154

<font>

Example RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.156

<$$font>

This triangle A.B.C.  {COM:figure_omitted} hath two corners equal
eche to other, that is A. and B, as I do by supposition limite,
wherfore it foloweth that the side A.C, is equal to that other side B.C,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.158

for the side A.C, lieth againste the angle B, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.159

and the side B.C, lieth against the angle A.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2R.160

<P_2,C2V>

<heading>

THE FOURTH THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.163

<$$heading>

when two lines are drawen fro~ the endes of anie one line, and meet in
anie pointe, it is not possible to draw two other lines of like lengthe
ech to his match that shal begi~ at the same pointes, and end in anie
other pointe then {in} the twoo first did.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.165

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.167

<$$font>

{COM:figure_omitted}

The first line is A.B, on which I haue erected two other lines A.C,
and B.C, that meete in the pricke C, wherefore I say, it is not possible
to draw ij. other lines from A. and B. which shal
mete in one point <paren> as you se A.D.  and B.D.  mete in D.
<$$paren> but that the match lines $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} vnequal,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.170

I mean by <font> match lines <$$font>, the two lines on one side,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.171

that is the ij. on the right hand, or the ij. on the lefte
hand, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.172

for as you se in this example A.D.  is longer the~ A.C.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.173

and A.D.  shall bee of one lengthe, if B.D.  and B.C.  bee like longe.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.174

For if one couple of matche lines be equall <paren> as the same example
A.E.  is equall to A.C.  in length <$$paren> then must B.E.  needes be
vnequall to B.C.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.175

as you see, it is here shorter.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.176

<heading>

THE FIFTE THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C2V.178

<heading>

If two tria~gles haue there ij. sides equal one to an other,
and their grou~d lines equal also, then <P_2,C3R> shall their corners,
whiche are contained betwene like sides, be equall one to the other.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.180

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.182

<$$font>

Because these two triangles A.B.C, and D.E.F.  haue two sides equall one
to an other.  {COM:figure_omitted} For A.C.  is equall to D.F, and B.C.
is equall to E.F, and again their grou~d lines A.B.  and D.E.  are lyke
in length, therfore is eche angle of the one triangle equall to ech angle
of the other, comparyng together those angles that are contained within
lyke sides, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.184

so is A. equall to D, B. to E, and C. to F,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.185

for they are contayned within like sides, as before is said.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.186

<heading>

THE SIXT THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.188

<$$heading>

when any right line standeth on an other, the ij. angles that thei
make, other are both right angles, or els equall to.ij.  righte angles.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.190

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.192

<$$font>

A.B.  is a right line, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.194

and on it there doth light another right line, drawen from C.
perpendicularly on it, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.195

{COM:figure_omitted}

therefore saie I, that the.ij.  angles that thei do make, are.ij.
right angles as maie be iudged by the definition of a right angle.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3R.197

But in the second part of the example, where A.B.  beyng still the
right line, on whiche D. standeth <P_2,C3V> in slope wayes,
but yet they are equall to two righte angles, RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3V.198

for so muche as the one is to greate, more then a righte angle, so muche
iuste is the other to little, so that bothe togither are equall to two
right angles, as you may perceiue.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3V.199

<heading>

THE SEUENTH THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,C3V.201

<$$heading>

If.ij.  lines be drawen to any one pricke in an other lyne, and those.ij.

is A.B.E, the fifte is D.E.B, and the sixte is B.E.F, of which sixe
triangles, A.D.E.  and D.E.B.  are equall bicause they haue one common
grounde line.  And so likewise A.B.E.  and A.B.D, whose commen grounde
line is A.B, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.436

but A.C.D.  is equal to B.E.F, being both betwene one couple of parallels
, not bicause thei haue one groune line, but bicause they haue their
ground lines equall, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.437

for C.D.  is equall to E.F, as you may declare thus.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.438

C.D, is equall to A.B.  <paren> by the foure and twenty Theoreme <$$paren>
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.439

for thei are two contrary sides of one lykeiamme.  A.C.D.B,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.440

and E.F by the same theoreme, is equall to A.B, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.441

for thei ar the two y=e= contrary sides of the likeiamme, A.E.F.B,
wherfore C.D.  must needes be equall to E.F.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.442

like wise the triangle A.C.D, is equal to A.B.E, bicause they ar
made betwene one paire of parallels and haue their groundlines like,
I meane C.D.  and A.B.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.443

Againe A.D.E, is equal to eche of them both, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.444

for his ground line D.E, is equall to A.B, in so muche as they are the
contrary sides of one likeiamme, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.445

that is the long square A.B.D.E.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.446

And thus may you proue the equalnes of all the reste.

THE XXIX. THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.449

<$$heading>

Al equal triangles that are made on one grounde line, and rise one waye,
must needes be betwene one paire of parallels.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.451

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2R.453

<$$font>

Take for example A.D.F, and D.E.B, which as the xxvij.
<P_2,E2V> conclusion dooth proue <$$paren> are equall togither,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.455

and as you see, they haue on ground line D.E.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.456

And againe they rise towarde one side, that is to say, vpwarde toward
the line A.B, wher fore they must needes be inclosed betweene one
paire of parallels, which are heere in this example A.B.  and D.E.

THE THIRTY THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.459

<$$heading>

Equal triangles that haue $their $ground {TEXT:the_irground} lines equal,
and be drawe~ toward one side, are made betwene one paire of paralleles.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.461

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.463

<$$font>

The example that declared the last theoreme, maye well serue to the
declaration of this also.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.465

For those ij. theoremes do diffre but in this one pointe, that
the laste theoreme meaneth of triangles, that haue one ground line common
to them both, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.466

and this theoreme doth presuppose the grounde lines to bee diuers,
but yet of one length, as A.C.D, and B.E.F, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.467

as they are ij. equall triangles approued, by the eighte and
twentye Theorem, so in the same Theorem it is declared, y=t= their grou~d
lines are equall togither, that is C.D, and E.F, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.468

now this beeynge true, and considering that they are made towarde one
side, it foloweth, that they are made betwene one paire of parallels
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.469

when I saye, drawen towarde one side, I meane that the triangles must be
drawen other both vpward frome one parallel, other els both downward ,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.470

then are they drawen betwene two paire of parallels, presupposinge one
to bee drawen by their ground line, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.471

and then do they ryse toward contrary sides.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E2V.472

THE XXXI. THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.475

<$$heading>

If a likeiamme haue one ground line with a triangle, and be drawen
betwene one paire of paralleles, then shall the likeiamme be double to
the triangle.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.477

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.479

<$$font>

A.H.  and B.G.  are.ij.  gemow lines, betwene which there is made a
triangle B.CG, and a lykeiamme, A.B.G.C, whiche haue a grounde lyne,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.481

that is to saye, B.G.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.482

{COM:figure_omitted}

Therfore doth it folow that the lyke iamme A.B.G.C.  is double to the
triangle B.C.G.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.484

For euery halfe of that lykeiamme is equall to the triangle, I
meane A.B.F.E.  other F.E.C.G.  as you may coniecture by the.xi.
conclusion geometrical.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.485

And as this Theoreme dothe speake of a triangle and likeiamme that haue
one groundelyne, so is it true also, yf theyr groundelynes be equall
, though they bee dyuers, so that thei be made betwene one payre of
paralleles.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.486

And hereof may you perceaue the reason, why in measuryng the platte
of a triangle, you must multiply the perpendicular lyne by halfe the
grounde lyne, or els the hole grounde lyne by halfe the perpendicular,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.487

for by any of these bothe {COM:sic} waies is there made a lykiamme
equall to halfe suche a one as shulde be made on the same hole
grounde lyne with the triangle, and betweene one payre of paralleles.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.488

Therfore as that lykeiamme is double to the triangle, so the halfe of it,
must needes be equall to the triangle.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.489

Compare the.xi.  conclusion with this theoreme.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.490

THE.XXXIJ.  THEOREME.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3R.492

<$$heading>

In all likeiammes where there are more than <P_2,E3V> one made aboute
one bias line, the fill squares of euery of them must nedes be equall.
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.494

<font>

Example.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.496

<$$font>

Fyrst before I declare the examples, it shal be mete to shew the true
vndersta~dyng of this theorem.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.498

Therfore by the <font> Bias line <$$font>, I meane that lyne, which in any
square figure dooth runne from corner to corner.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.499

And euery square which is diuided by that bias line into equall halues
from corner to corner <paren> that is to say, into.ij.  equall triangles
<$$paren> those be counted <font> to stande aboute one bias line <$$font>
, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.500

and the other squares, whiche touche that bias line, with one of their
corners onely, those doo I call <font> Fyll squares <$$font>, accordyng
to the greke name, whiche is <font> anapleromata <$$font>, and called in
latin <font> supplementa <$$font>, bycause that they make one generall
square, includyng and enclosyng the other diuers squares , as in this
exa~ple H.C.E.N.  is one square likeiamme, and L.M.G.C.  is an other,
{COM:figures_omitted} whiche bothe are made aboute one bias line,
RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.501

that is N.M, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.502

than K.L.H.C.  and C.E.F.G.  are.ij.  fyll squares, RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.503

for they doo fyll vp the sydes of the.ij fyrste square lykeiammes,
in suche sorte, that of all them foure is made one greate generall
square K.M.F.N.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.504

Nowe to the sentence of the theoreme, I say, that the.ij.  fill squares
, H.K.L.C.  and C.E.F.G.  are both equall togither, <paren> as it
shall bee declared in the booke of proofes <$$paren> bicause they are
the fill squares of two likeiammes made aboute one bias line, as the
exaumple sheweth.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,E3V.505

If a right line be deuided as chance happeneth the iiij. long
squares, that may be made of that whole line and one of his partes with
the square of the other part, shall be equall to the square that is made
of the whole line and the saide first portion ioyned to him in lengthe

The firste line is A.B, RECORD-E1-P2,2,G1R.516

and is deuided by C. into two vnequall partes as happeneth

K.L.PO <$$paren> is reckened twise, ones as parcell of the second long
square and agayne as parte of the <P_2,G1V> thirde longsquare, to auoide
ambiguite, you may place one insteede of it, an other square of equalitee,
with it.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,G1V.525

that is to saye, D.E.K.H, which was at no tyme accompting as percell of
any one of them, RECORD-E1-P2,2,G1V.526

and then haue you iiij. long squares distinctly made of the whole
line A.B, and his lesser portion A.C.  RECORD-E1-P2,2,G1V.527

And that those fiue squares doo make iuste as muche as the whole square
of that longer line D.G, <paren> whiche is as longe as A.B, and A.C.
<$$paren> ioyned togither <$$paren> it may be iudged easyly by the eye
