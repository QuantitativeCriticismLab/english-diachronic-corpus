<P_38>

Troweth the protector <paren> I pray god he may proue a protectour
<$$paren> troweth he that I parceiue not whereunto his painted processe
draweth?  MORERIC-E1-P2,38.2

It is not honorable that the duke bide here: MORERIC-E1-P2,38.3

it were comfortable for them both that he wer with his brother, because
y=e= king lacketh a play felowye be ye sure.  MORERIC-E1-P2,38.4

I pray god send them both better play felowes then hym, that maketh
so high a matter vpon such a trifling pretext: as though there coulde
none be founden to playe with the kyng, but if his brother y=t= hath no
lust to play for sicknes, come oute of sanctuary out of hys sauegarde,
to play with him.  As though princes as yonge as thei be, could not play
but with their Peres, or children could not play but w=t= their kyndred,
with whom for the more part they agree much worse then wyth straungers.
MORERIC-E1-P2,38.5

But the childe $can $not {TEXT:cannot} require the priuelege,
MORERIC-E1-P2,38.6

who tolde hym so?  MORERIC-E1-P2,38.7

he shal here him aske it MORERIC-E1-P2,38.8

and he will.  MORERIC-E1-P2,38.9

Howbeit this is a gay matter: MORERIC-E1-P2,38.10

Suppose he could not aske it, MORERIC-E1-P2,38.11

suppose he woulde not aske it, MORERIC-E1-P2,38.12

suppose hee woulde aske to goe owte, MORERIC-E1-P2,38.13

if I saye hee shall not, if I aske the priuilege but for my selfe,
I say he that agaynst my wyll taketh out him, breaketh the sanctuary.
MORERIC-E1-P2,38.14

Serueth this liberty for my person onlye, or for my goodes to?
MORERIC-E1-P2,38.15

ye maye not hence take my horsse fro me: MORERIC-E1-P2,38.16

and maye you take my childe fro me?  MORERIC-E1-P2,38.17

he is also my warde, MORERIC-E1-P2,38.18

for as my lerned counsell sheweth mee, syth he hath nothing by discent
holden by knightes seruice, the law maketh, his mother his gardaine.
MORERIC-E1-P2,38.19

Then may no man, I suppose take my warde fro me oute of <P_39> sanctuarye
, wythout the breche of the sanctuary.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.20

And if my pryuelege could not serue hym, nor he aske it for hymselfe,
yet sythe the lawe committeth to me the custody of him, I may require it
for hym, excepte the lawe giue a childe a gardayne onely for his goodes
& hys landes, discharging hym of the cure and saufe kepyng of hys body,
for whych only both landes & goodes serue.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.21

{COM:beginning_of_passage_translated_from_more's_latin_text_but_not_by_him}

And if examples be sufficient to obtayne priueledge for my chylde,
I nede not farre to seeke.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.23

For in thys place in which we now be <paren> and whych is now in questyon
whyther my chylde may take benefyte of it <$$paren> myne other sonne now
kyng was born, and kept in hys cradle, and preserued to a more prosperous
fortune, which I pray god long to continu.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.24

And as all you know, this is not y=e= first tyme that I haue taken
sanctuarye, MORERIC-E1-P2,39.25

for when my lord my husbande was banished & thrust out of his kingdom,
I fled hither being great with child, MORERIC-E1-P2,39.26

and here I bare the prynce.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.27

And when my lorde my husbande retourned safe again and had the victorye,
than went I hence to welcome him home, MORERIC-E1-P2,39.28

and from hence I brought my babe the prynce vnto hys father, when he
fyrste toke hym in hys armes.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.29

And I praye God y=t= my sonnes palace may be as great sauegard
to him now rayning, as thys place was sometime to the kinges
enemye.  In whych place I entend to kepe his brother sith &c.
{COM:end_of_passage_translated_from_more's_latin_text_but_not_by_him}
Wherfore here intend I to kepe him sins mans law serueth y=e= gardain
to kepe the infant.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.30

The law of nature wyll the mother kepe her childe.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.31

Gods law pryuelegeth the sanctuary, & the sanctuary my sonne, sith I
fere to put hym in the protectours handes that hath hys brother already,
and were if bothe fayled, inheritour to the crowne.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.32

The cause of my fere hath no man to doe to examine.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.33

And yet fere I no ferther then y=e= law fereth which as lerned men tell me
forbiddeth euery man the custody of them, by whose death he may inherite
lesse lande then a kingdome.  MORERIC-E1-P2,39.34

<P_40>

I can no more, MORERIC-E1-P2,40.36

but whosoeuer he be that breketh this holy sanctuary: I pray god
shorttly sende him nede of sanctuary, when he may not come to it.
MORERIC-E1-P2,40.37

For taken out of sanctuary would I not my mortall enemy were.
MORERIC-E1-P2,40.38

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample}

<P_42>

{COM:beginning_of_passage_translated_from_more's_latin_text_but_not_by_him}

When y=e= protector had both y=e= children in his handes, he opened
himself more boldly, both to certaine other men, and also chiefely to
the duke of Buckingham.  MORERIC-E1-P2,42.42

Although I know that many thought, that this duke was priuy to al the
protectours counsel, euen from the beginning.  And some of the protectours
frendes said, that the duke was the first mouer of the protectoure to this
matter, sending a priuie messenger <P_43> vnto him, streight after king
Edwards death.  But other again which knewe better the suttle wit of the
protectour, deny that he euer opened his enterprise to the duke, vntill
he had brought to passe the thinges before rehersed.  MORERIC-E1-P2,43.43

But when he had imprisoned the quenes kinsefolkes, & gotten bothe her
sonnes into his owne handes, than hee opened the rest of his purpose with
lesse fere to them whom he thought mete for the matter, and specially
to y=e= duke: who being wonne to his purpose, he thought his strength
more then halfe encreased.  MORERIC-E1-P2,43.44

The matter was broken vnto the duke, by suttell folkes, and such as
were their crafte maisters in the handling of such wicked deuises:
who declared vnto him, y=t= the yong king was offended with him for his
kinsfolkes sakes, and that if he were euer able, he would reuenge them.
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.45

Who wold prick him forward therunto, if they escaped <paren> for they
would remembre their imprisonment <$$paren>.  MORERIC-E1-P2,43.46

Or els if thei wer put to death, without doubte the yonge king wold
be careful for their deathes, whose imprisonment was greuous vnto him.
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.47

And that with repenting the duke should nothing auaile:
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.48

for there was no way left to redeme his offence by benefites:
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.49

but he should soner distroy himself than saue the king, who with his
brother & his kinsefolkes he saw in such places imprisoned, as the
protectour might w=t= a beck distroy them al: MORERIC-E1-P2,43.50

and that it were no doubte but he woulde do it in dede, if there wer
any new enterprise attempted.  And that it was likely that as y=e=
protectour had prouided priuy garde for himself, so had he spialles for
the duke , and traines to catche hym, if he should be againste him, &
that paraduenture from them, whom he least suspected.  MORERIC-E1-P2,43.51

For the state of thinges & the disposicions of men wer than such, that
a man could not wel tell whom he might truste, or whom he might feare.
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.52

These thinges and such like, being beaten into the dukes minde, brought
him to that pointe, y=t= where he had repented the way that he had entred,
yet wold he go forth in the same: MORERIC-E1-P2,43.53

& since he had ones begon, he would stoutly go through.
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.54

And therefore to thys wicked enterprise, which he beleued coulde not
bee voided, hee bent himselfe MORERIC-E1-P2,43.55

and went through: MORERIC-E1-P2,43.56

and determined, that since the comon mischief could not be amended
, he wold tourne it as much as he might to hys owne commodite.
MORERIC-E1-P2,43.57

<P_44>

Than it was agreed, that the protectour should haue the dukes aide
to make him king, & that the protectours onely lawful sonne, should
mary y=e= dukes daughter, and that the protectour shold graunt him
the quiet possession of the Erledome of Hertford, which he claimed
as his enheritance, and could neuer obtain it in king Edwardes time.
MORERIC-E1-P2,44.59

Besides these requestes of y=e= duke, the protectour of hys owne minde
promised him a great quantite of the kinges tresure & of his howsehold
stuffe.  MORERIC-E1-P2,44.60

And when they wer thus at a point betwene themselfes, they went about to
prepare for the coronacyon of y=e= yong king as they would haue it seme.
MORERIC-E1-P2,44.61

And that they might turne both the eies & mindes of men, from perceiuing
of their driftes other where the lordes being sent for from al parties
of the realme, came thick to that solemnite.  MORERIC-E1-P2,44.62

But the protectour & the duke, after y=t=, that they had set
the lord Cardinall, the Archebishoppe of Yorke than lorde
Chauncellour, the Bishoppe of Ely, the lord Stanley & the lord
Hastinges than lord chamberleine, w=t= many other noble men
{COM:end_of_passage_translated_from_more's_latin_text_but_not_by_him}
to commune & deuise about the coronacion in one place: as fast were they
in an other place contryuyng the contrary, & to make the protectour kyng.
To which counsel, albeit there were adhibit very few, & they very secret :
yet began there here & there about, some maner of muttering amonge the
people, as though al should not long be wel, though they neither wist
what thei feared nor wherfore: were it that before such great thinges
, mens hartes of a secret instinct of nature misgiueth them.  As y=e=
sea w=t=out wind swelleth of himself somtime before a tempest: or were
it that some one man happely somwhat perceiuing, filled mani men w=t=
suspicion, though he shewed few men what he knew.  MORERIC-E1-P2,44.63

Howbeit somwhat the dealing self made men to muse on the mater, though
the counsell were close.  MORERIC-E1-P2,44.64

For litle and little all folke withdrew from the Tower,
MORERIC-E1-P2,44.65

and drew to Crosbies place in Bishops gates strete wher the protectour
kept his household.  MORERIC-E1-P2,44.66

The protectour had the resort, MORERIC-E1-P2,44.67

the king in maner <P_45> dessolate.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.68

While some for their busines made sute to them that had the doing, some
were by their frendes secretly warned, that it might happelye tourne
them to no good, to be to much attendaunt about the king w=t=out the
protectours appointment: which remoued also diuers of the princes olde
seruantes from him, & set newe aboute him.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.69

Thus many thinges comming togither partly by chaunce, partly of purpose,
caused at length, not comen people only that waue with the winde, but
wise men also & some lordes, yeke to marke the mater and muse theron :
so ferforth that the lord Stanly, y=t= was after Erle of Darbie, wisely
mistrusted it, & saied vnto y=e= lord Hasting, y=t= he much misliked
these two seuerall counsels.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.70

For while we <paren> quod he <$$paren> talke of one matter in the
tone place, litle wote we wherof they talk in y=e= tother place.
MORERIC-E1-P2,45.71

My lord <paren> quod the lord Hastinges <$$paren> on my life neuer
doute you.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.72

For while one man is there which is neuer thence, neuer can there be
thinge ones minded that should sownde amisse toward me, but it should be
in mine eares ere it were well oute of their mouthes.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.73

This ment he by Catesby, which was of his nere secret counsail, and
whome he veri familiarly vsed, MORERIC-E1-P2,45.74

and in his most weighty matters put no man in so special trust, rekening
hymself to no man so liefe, sith he well wist there was no man to him
so much beholden as was thys Catesby, which was a man wel lerned in the
lawes of this lande, & by the special fauour of the lorde chamberlen,
in good aucthoritie & much rule bare in al the county of Leceter where
the Lorde Chamberlens power chiefly laye.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.75

But surely great pity was it, that he had not had either more trouthe
or lesse wytte.  MORERIC-E1-P2,45.76

For his dissimulacion onelye, kepte all that mischyefe vppe.  In whome
if the lord Hastinges had not put so special trust, the lord Stanley
and he <P_46> had departed with diuerse other lordes, and broken all the
daunce, for many il signes that hee sawe, which he nowe construed all to
the beste.  So suerly thoughte he that there could be none harme toward
him in that counsaile entended where Catesby was.  MORERIC-E1-P2,46.77

{COM:insert_helsinki_sample}

<P_47>

Then the lord chamberlen, as he y=t= for the loue betwene them thoughte
he might be boldest w=t= him, aunswered MORERIC-E1-P2,47.80

and sayd, y=t= thei wer worthye to bee punished as heighnous traitors
whatsoeuer they were.  MORERIC-E1-P2,47.81

And al the other affirmed the same.  MORERIC-E1-P2,47.82

That is <paren> quod he <$$paren> yonder sorceres my brothers wife &
other w=t= her meaning y=e= quene.  MORERIC-E1-P2,47.83

At these wordes many of the other Lordes were gretly abashed y=t=
fauoured her.  MORERIC-E1-P2,47.84

But the lord Hastinges was in his minde better content, that it was
moued by her, then by any other whom he loued better: Albeit hys harte
somewhat <P_48> grudged, that he was not afore made of counsell in
this mater as he was of y=e= taking of her kynred, and of their putting
to death, which were by his assent before, deuised to bee byhedded at
Pountfreit, this selfe same day, in which he was not ware y=t= it was by
other deuised, that himself should the same day be behedded at London.
MORERIC-E1-P2,48.85

Then said the protectour: ye shal al se in what wise that sorceres and
that other witch of her counsel shoris wife w=t= their affynite, haue
by their sorcery & witchcraft wasted my body.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.86

And therw=t= he plucked vp hys doublet sleue to his elbow vpon his
left arme, where he shewed a werish withered arme and small, as it was
neuer other.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.87

And thereupon euery mannes mind sore misgaue them, well perceiuing that
this matter was but a quarel.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.88

For wel thei wist, that y=e= quene was to wise to go aboute any such
folye.  And also if she would, yet wold she of all folke leste make
Shoris wife of counsaile, whom of al women she most hated, as that
concubine whom the king her husband had most loued.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.89

And also no man was there present, but wel knew that his harme was euer
such since his birth.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.90

Natheles the lorde Chamberlen <paren> which fro y=e= death of king
Edward kept Shoris wife, on whome he somwhat doted in the kinges life,
sauing as it is sayd he that while forbare her of reuerence towarde hys
king, or els of a certaine kinde of fidelite to hys frende <$$paren>
aunswered MORERIC-E1-P2,48.91

& sayd: certainly my lorde if they haue so heinously done, thei be worthy
heinouse punishement.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.92

What quod the protectour thou seruest me I wene w=t= iffes & with andes
, MORERIC-E1-P2,48.93

I tel the thei haue so done, MORERIC-E1-P2,48.94

& that I will make good on thy body traitour.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.95

And therw=t= as in a great anger, he clapped his fist vpon y=e= borde a
great rappe.  At which token giuen, one cried treason without the cambre.
MORERIC-E1-P2,48.96

Therwith a dore clapped, MORERIC-E1-P2,48.97

and in come there rushing men in harneys as many as y=e= chambre might
hold.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.98

And anon the protectour sayd to the lorde Hastinges: I arest the traitour.
MORERIC-E1-P2,48.99

What me my Lorde quod he.  MORERIC-E1-P2,48.100

Yea the <P_49> traitour, quod the protectour.  MORERIC-E1-P2,49.101

And a nother let flee at the Lorde Standley which shronke at the stroke &
fel under the table, MORERIC-E1-P2,49.102

or els his hed had ben clefte to the tethe: MORERIC-E1-P2,49.103

for as shortely as he shranke, yet ranne the blood aboute hys eares.
MORERIC-E1-P2,49.104

Then were they al quickly bestowed in diuerse chambres, except y=e=
lorde Chamberlen, whom the protectour bade spede & shryue hym a pace,
MORERIC-E1-P2,49.105

for by saynt Poule <paren> quod he <$$paren> I wil not to dinner til I
se thy hed of.  MORERIC-E1-P2,49.106

It boted him not to aske why MORERIC-E1-P2,49.107

but heuely he toke a priest at aduenture, MORERIC-E1-P2,49.108

& made a short shrift, MORERIC-E1-P2,49.109

for a longer would not be suffered, the protectour made so much hast to
dyner: which he might not go to til this wer done for sauing of his othe.
MORERIC-E1-P2,49.110

So was he brought forth into the grene beside the chappel w=t=in the tower
, & his head laid down vpon a long log of timbre, and there striken of,
and afterward his body with the hed entred at Windsore beside the body
of kinge Edward, whose both soules our lord pardon.  MORERIC-E1-P2,49.111

A merueilouse case is it to here, either the warninges of that
he shoulde haue voided, or the tokens of that he could not voide.
MORERIC-E1-P2,49.112

For the self night next before his death, y=e= lord Standley sent a
trustie secret messenger vnto him at midnight in al the hast, requiring
hym to rise & ryde away with hym, MORERIC-E1-P2,49.113

for he was disposed vtterly no lenger to bide: MORERIC-E1-P2,49.114

<P_50>

he had so fereful a dreme, in which him thoughte that a bore with his
tuskes so raced them both bi the heddes, that the blood ranne aboute
both their shoulders.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.116

And forasmuch as the protectour gaue the bore for his cognisaunce,
this dreme made so fereful an impression in his hart, y=t= he was
throughly determined no lenger to tary, but had his horse redy, if y=e=
lord Hastinges wold go w=t= him to ride so far yet y=e= same night,
that thei shold be out of danger ere dai.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.117

Ey good lord quod y=e= lord Hastinges to this messenger, leneth my lord
thi master so much to such trifles, & hath such faith in dremes, which
either his own fere fantasieth or do rise in y=e= nightes rest by reson
of his daye thoughtes?  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.118

Tel him it is plaine witchcraft to beleue in suche dremes: which if they
wer tokens of thinges to come, why thinketh he not that we might be as
likely to make them true by our going if we were caught & brought back
<paren> as frendes fayle fleers <$$paren> for then had the bore a cause
likely to race vs w=t= his tuskes, as folke that fled for some falshed,
wherfore either is there no peryl, nor none there is in dede: or if any
be, it is rather in going then biding.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.119

And if we should nedes cost fall in perill one way or other: yet
had I leuer y=t= men should se it wer by other mens falshed, then
{COM:I_would_want_that_they_should} thinke it were either our owne faulte
or faint hart.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.120

And therfore go to thy master man, MORERIC-E1-P2,50.121

& commende me to him, MORERIC-E1-P2,50.122

& pray him be mery & haue no fere: MORERIC-E1-P2,50.123

for I ensure hym I am as sure of the man y=t= he woteth of, as I am of
my own hand.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.124

God sende grace sir quod the messenger, MORERIC-E1-P2,50.125

and went his way.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.126

Certain is it also, y=t= in y=e= riding toward y=e= tower, y=e= same
morning in which he was behedded, his hors twise or thrise stumbled w=t=
him almost to y=e= falling, which thing albeit eche man wote wel daily
happeneth to them to whom no such mischaunce is toward: yet hath it
ben of an olde rite & custome, obserued as a token often times notably
foregoing some great misfortune.  MORERIC-E1-P2,50.127

Now this y=t= foloweth was no warning, but an enemiouse scorne.
MORERIC-E1-P2,50.128

<P_51>

The same morning ere he were vp, came a knight vnto him, as it were of
curtesy to accompany hym to the counsaile, but of trouth sent by the
protector to hast him thitherward, wyth whom he was of secret confederacy
in that purpose, a meane man at that time, and now of gret auctorite.
MORERIC-E1-P2,51.130

This knight when it happed the lord Chamberlen by y=e= way to stay his
horse, and comen a while w=t= a priest whome he met in the tower strete,
brake his tale MORERIC-E1-P2,51.131

& said merely to him: what my lord I pray you come on,
MORERIC-E1-P2,51.132

whereto talke you so long w=t= that priest, MORERIC-E1-P2,51.133

you haue no nede of a prist yet: MORERIC-E1-P2,51.134

& therw=t= he laughed vpon him, as though he would say, ye shal haue sone.
MORERIC-E1-P2,51.135

But so litle wist y=e= tother what he ment, & so little mistrusted,
that he was neuer merier nor neuer so full of good hope in his life:
which self thing is often sene a signe of chaunge.  MORERIC-E1-P2,51.136

But I shall rather let anye thinge passe me, then the vain sureti of
mans mind so nere his deth.  MORERIC-E1-P2,51.137

Vpon the very tower wharfe so nere the place where his hed was of so
sone after, there met he w=t= one Hastinges a purseuant of his own name.
MORERIC-E1-P2,51.138

And of their meting in y=t= place, he was put in remembraunce of an
other time, in which it had happened them before, to mete in like maner
togither in the same place.  At which other tyme the lord Chamberlein had
ben accused vnto king Edward, by y=e= lord Riuers y=e= quenes brother,
in such wise y=t= he was for y=e= while <paren> but it lasted not long
<$$paren> farre fallen into y=e= kinges indignation, & stode in gret
fere of himselfe.  MORERIC-E1-P2,51.139

And for asmuch as he nowe met this purseuant in the same place that
iubardy so wel passed: it gaue him great pleasure to talke w=t= him
therof w=t= whom he had before talked thereof, <P_52> in the same place
while he was therin.  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.140

And therfore he said: Ah hastinges, art y=u= remembred when I met thee
here ones with an heuy hart?  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.141

Yea my lord <paren> quod he <$$paren> that remembre I wel:
MORERIC-E1-P2,52.142

& thanked be God they gate no good, nor ye none harme thereby.
MORERIC-E1-P2,52.143

Thou wouldest say so quod he, if thou knewest asmuch as I know, which
few know els as yet & moe shall shortly.  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.144

That ment he by the lordes of the quenes kindred that were taken before
, and should that day be behedded at Poumfreit: which he wel wyst,
MORERIC-E1-P2,52.145

but nothing ware that y=e= axe hang ouer his own hed.
MORERIC-E1-P2,52.146

In faith man quod he, I was neuer so sory, nor neuer stode in so great
dread in my life, as I did when thou and I met here.  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.147

And lo how y=e= world is turned, MORERIC-E1-P2,52.148

now stand mine enemies in y=e= daunger <paren> as thou maist hap to here
more hereafter <$$paren> & I neuer in my life so mery, nor neuer in so
great suerty.  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.149

O good god, the blindnes of our mortall nature, MORERIC-E1-P2,52.150

when he most feared, he was in good suerty: MORERIC-E1-P2,52.151

when he rekened him self surest, he lost his life, MORERIC-E1-P2,52.152

& that w=t=in two howres after.  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.153

Thus ended this honorable man, a good knight and a gentle, of gret
aucthorite w=t= his prince, of liuing somewhat dessolate, plaine & open to
his enemy, & secret to his frend: eth to begile, as he that of good hart
& corage forestudied no perilles.  A louing man & passing wel beloued.
Very faithful, & trusty ynough, trusting to much.  MORERIC-E1-P2,52.154

<P_56>

I doubt not some shal think this woman to sleight a thing, to be written
of & set amonge the remembraunces of great matters: which thei shal
specially think, y=t= happely shal esteme her only by y=t= thei now
see her.  MORERIC-E1-P2,56.156

But me semeth the chaunce so much the more worthy to be remembred, in how
much she is now in the more beggerly condicion, vnfrended & worne out of
acquaintance, after good substance, after as gret fauour w=t= the prince,
<P_57> after as gret sute & seking to w=t= al those y=t= those days had
busynes to spede, as many other men were in their times, which be now
famouse, only by y=e= infamy of their il dedes.  MORERIC-E1-P2,57.157

Her doinges were not much lesse, albeit thei be muche lesse remembred,
because thei were not so euil.  MORERIC-E1-P2,57.158

For men vse if they haue an euil turne, to write it in marble:
MORERIC-E1-P2,57.159

& whoso doth vs a good tourne, we write it in duste which is not worst
proued by her: MORERIC-E1-P2,57.160

for at this daye shee beggeth of many at this daye liuing, y=t= at this
day had begged if she had not bene.  MORERIC-E1-P2,57.161

Now was it so deuised by y=e= protectour & his counsel, y=t= the self
day in which the lord Chamberlen was behedded in the tower of London,
& about the selfsame hower, was there not without his assent behedded
at Poontfraite, the fore remembred lordes & knightes y=t= were taken
from the king at Northampton & Stony Stratford.  Which thinge was done
in the presence & by the order of syr Richard Ratclif knight, whose
seruice y=e= protector specially vsed in y=e= counsel and in thexecucion
of such lawles enterprises, as a man y=t= had ben long secret w=t= him,
hauing experience of y=e= world & a shrewde wit, short & rude in speche ,
rough & boustiouse of behauiour, bold in mischief, as far from pitie as
from al fere of god.  MORERIC-E1-P2,57.162

This knight bringing them out of y=e= prison to y=e= scafold, & shewing
to the people about y=t= thei were Traitors, not suffring them to speke &
declare their innocence lest their wordes might haue inclined men to pity
them, & to hate the protectour & his part: caused them hastly without
iugement, <P_58> processe, or maner of order to be behedded, & w=t=out
other earthly gilt, but only y=t= thei were good men, to true to y=e=
king & to nigh to the quene.  MORERIC-E1-P2,58.163

Now when the lord Chamberlen & these other lordes & knightes were thus
behedded & ridde out of the way: then thought the protectour, y=t= while
men mused what y=e= mater ment, while y=e= lordes of the realme wer about
him out of their owne strenghtis, while no man wist what to thinke nor
whome to trust, ere euer they should haue space to dispute & disgest
the mater & make parties: it wer best hastly to pursue his purpose, &
put himself in possession of y=e= crowne, ere men could haue time to
deuise ani wais to resist.  MORERIC-E1-P2,58.164

But now was al the study, by what meane thys matter being of it self
so heinouse, might be first broken to the people, in such wise that it
might be wel taken.  MORERIC-E1-P2,58.165

To this counsel they toke diuerse, such as they thought metely to be
trusted, likely to be indused to y=e= parte, & able to stand them in
stede, either by power or policy.  Among whom, they made of Counsail
Edmond Shaa knight then Maier of London, which vpon trust of his own
aduauncement, whereof he was of a proud hart highly desirouse, shold
frame the cite to their appetite.  MORERIC-E1-P2,58.166

Of spiritual men thei toke such as had wit, & were in aucthoritie among
the peple for oppinion of ther lerning, & had no scrupilouse consience.
MORERIC-E1-P2,58.167

Among these had thei Iohn Shaa clerke brother to y=e= Maier, & freer
Penker prouincial of the Augustine freers both doctors of diuinite,
both gret prechars, both of more learning then vertue, of more fame
then lerning.  MORERIC-E1-P2,58.168

For thei were before gretly estemed among the peple: but after that neuer.
MORERIC-E1-P2,58.169

Of these two y=e= tone had a sermon in praise of the protectour before
the <P_59> coronacion, the tother after, both so ful of tediouse flatery,
that no mans eares could abide them.  MORERIC-E1-P2,59.170

Penker in his sermon so lost his voice that he was faine to leaue of &
come downe in the middes.  MORERIC-E1-P2,59.171

Doctor Shaa by his sermon lost his honestie, & sone after his life, for
very shame of the worlde, into which he durst neuer after come abrode.
MORERIC-E1-P2,59.172

But the frere forced for no shame, MORERIC-E1-P2,59.173

& so it harmed him y=e= lesse.  MORERIC-E1-P2,59.174

Howbeit some dout & many thinken, that Penker was not of counsel of
the mater before the coronacion, but after the comen maner fell to
flattery after: namely sith his sermon was not incontinent vpon it,
but at S. Mary hospytall at the Ester after.  MORERIC-E1-P2,59.175

But certaine is it, that Doctour Shaa was of counsel in the beginning,
so farre forth that they determined that he should first breke the mater
in a sermon at Poules Crosse, in whiche he shold by y=e= aucthorite of
his preaching, encline the peple to the protectours ghostly purpose.
MORERIC-E1-P2,59.176

But now was al the labour & study, in the deuis of some conuenient
pretext, for which the peple should be content, to depose the prince &
accept the protector for kinge.  In which diuerse thinges they deuised.
MORERIC-E1-P2,59.177

But the chief thing & the weighty of al that inuencion, rested in this
y=t= they should allege bastardy, either in king Edward himself, or in
his children, or both.  So that he should seme dishabled to inherite the
crowne by the duke of Yorke, and the prince by him.  MORERIC-E1-P2,59.178

To lay bastardy in kynge Edward, sowned openly to the rebuke
of the protectours owne mother, which was mother to them both:
MORERIC-E1-P2,59.179

for in y=t= point could be none other colour, but to pretend that his
own mother was one aduouteresse which not w=t=standing to farther this
purpose he letted not: MORERIC-E1-P2,59.180

but Natheles he would y=e= point should be lesse & more fauorably handled
, not euen fully plain & directly, but that y=e= matter should be touched
a slope craftely, as though men spared in y=t= point to speke al the
trouth for fere of his displeasure.  MORERIC-E1-P2,59.181

But y=e= other point concerning the bastardy that they deuised to
surmise in king Edwards children, y=t= wold he should be openly
declared & inforsed to the vttermost.  The coloure & pretext wherof
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be wel <P_60> perceiued, but if we first
repete you some thinges longe before done about king Edwardes mariage.
MORERIC-E1-P2,60.182

After y=t= king Edward y=e= fourthe had deposed kinge Henry the sixt, &
was in peasyble possession of the realme, determining himself to mary,
as it was requisite bothe for himself & for the realme, he sent ouer in
embassiate, the Erle of warwike with other noble men in his company vnto
Spaine, to intreate & conclude a mariage betwene king Edward & the kinges
doughter of Spain.  In which thing y=e= Erle of Warwik founde the parties
so toward & willing, y=t= he spedely according to his instruccions,
w=t=out any difficulty brought y=e= matter to verye good conclusion.
MORERIC-E1-P2,60.183

Now happed it that in the meane season, there came to make a sute by
peticion to the king, dame Elizabeth Gray which was after his quene,
at that tyme a widow borne of noble blood, specyally by her mother,
which was Duches of Bedford ere she maried the lord Wodefeld her father.
MORERIC-E1-P2,60.184

Howbeit this dame Elizabeth her self being in seruice w=t= quene Margaret
, wife vnto king Henry the.vi.  was maried vnto one Iohn Gray a squier
whom king Henry made knight vpon the field y=t= he had on Shroue Tuesday
at Saint Albans against king Edward.  MORERIC-E1-P2,60.185

And litle while enioyed he y=t= knighthod, MORERIC-E1-P2,60.186

for he was at y=e= same field slaine.  After which done, & the Erle
of Warwik being in his embassiate about $th $afore {TEXT:thafore}
remembred mariage, this pore Lady made humble sute vnto y=e= king, y=t=
she might be restored vnto such smal landes as her late husband had giuen
her in iointure.  <P_61> Whom when y=e= king beheld, & hard her speke,
as she was both faire, of a good fauor, moderate of stature, wel made
& very wise: he not only pitied her, but also waxed ennamored on her.
MORERIC-E1-P2,61.187

And taking her afterward secretly aside, began to entre in talking
more familiarly.  Whose appetite when she perceiued, she verteousely
denyed him.  MORERIC-E1-P2,61.188

But y=t= did she so wiseli, & with so good maner, & wordes so wel set,
that she rather kindled his desire then quenched it.  MORERIC-E1-P2,61.189

And fynally after many a meting, much woing & many great promises,
she wel espied the kinges affeccion toward her so greatly encresed,
y=t= she durst somwhat y=e= more boldly say her minde, as to hym whose
harte she perceiued more firmely set, then to fall of for a worde.
MORERIC-E1-P2,61.190

And in conclusion she shewed him plaine, y=t= as she wist herself
to simple to be his wife, so thought she her self to good to be his
concubine.  MORERIC-E1-P2,61.191

The king much merueling of her constaunce, as he y=t= had not ben wont
els where to be so stiffely sayd naye, so muche estemed her contynence
and chastitie, y=t= he set her vertue in the stede of possession & riches.
MORERIC-E1-P2,61.192

And thus taking counsaile of his desyre, determined in al possible hast
to mary her.  MORERIC-E1-P2,61.193

And after he was thus appointed, & hadde betwene them twain ensured her:
then asked he counsel of his other frendes, MORERIC-E1-P2,61.194

and y=t= in suche maner, as thei might ethe perceiue it boted not greatly
to say nay.  MORERIC-E1-P2,61.195

Notwithstanding y=e= Duches of york his <P_62> mother was so sore moued
therewith, y=t= she diswaded y=e= mariage asmuch as she possible might
alleging y=t= it was his honor, profite, and surety also, to mary in
a noble progeny out of his realm, whereupon depended gret strength to
his estate by y=e= affinytie & great possibilitie of encrease of his
possessions.  And y=t= he could not well otherwise do, standing that
y=e= Earle of warwik had so far moued already.  Whiche wer not likely
to take it well, if al his viage were in suche wise frustrate, and his
appointmentes deluded.  MORERIC-E1-P2,62.196

And she said also y=t= it was not princely to mary hys owne subiect,
no gret occasion leading thervnto, no possessions, or other commodityes,
depending therupon, MORERIC-E1-P2,62.197

but onely as it were a rich man that would mary his mayde, onely for a
litle wanton dotage vppon her parson.  In which mariage manye moe commend
y=e= maidens fortune, then y=e= maisters wisdom.  MORERIC-E1-P2,62.198

And yet therin she said was more honesty, then honor in this mariage.
Forasmuch as there is betwene no merchant & his own maid so gret
difference, as betwene y=e= king and this widowe.  In whose parson albeit
ther was nothing to be misliked, yet was there she saide: nothing so
excellent, but y=t= it might be founden in diuers other, y=t= wer more
metely <paren> quod she <$$paren> for your estate, & maydens also, wheras
y=e= only widowhed of Elizabeth Gray though she wer in al other thinges
conuenient for you, shold yet suffice as me semeth to refrain you from
her mariage, sith it is an vnfitting thing, & a veri blemish, & highe
disparagement, to the sacre magesty of a prince, y=t= ought as nigh to
approche priesthode in clenes as he doth in dignitie, to be defouled w=t=
bigamy in his first mariage.  MORERIC-E1-P2,62.199

<P_63>

The king when his mother had said, made her answer part in ernest
part in play merely, as he that wiste himself out of her rule.
MORERIC-E1-P2,63.201

And albeit he would gladly y=t= she shold take it wel, yet was at a pointe
in his owne mynde, toke she it wel or otherwise.  MORERIC-E1-P2,63.202

Howbeit somwhat to satisfy her he saide, y=t= albeit mariage being a
spiritual thing, ought rather to be made for y=e= respecte of God where
his grace enclineth y=e= parties to loue together as he trusted it was
in his then for y=e= regard of any temporal aduauntage: yet natheles him
semed y=t= this mariage euen worldly considred, was not vnprofitable.
MORERIC-E1-P2,63.203

For he reckened y=e= amitye of no earthly nacion so necessari for him,
as y=e= frendship of his own.  Which he thought likely to beare him
so muche y=e= more herty fauor in y=t= he disdayned not to marye w=t=
one of his own land.  MORERIC-E1-P2,63.204

And yet yf outeward aliance wer thought so requisite, he wold find y=e=
meanes to enter therinto, much better bi other of his kin, wher al y=e=
parties could be contented, than to mary himself, whom hee shoulde
happelye neuer loue, and for y=e= possibility of more possessions, lese
y=e= fruit & pleasure of this y=t= he had alredy.  MORERIC-E1-P2,63.205

For smal pleasure taketh a man of al y=t= euer he hath beside, yf he
bee wiued against his appetite.  MORERIC-E1-P2,63.206

And I dout not quod he but there be as ye saye other, y=t= be in euery
point comparable w=t= her.  MORERIC-E1-P2,63.207

And therfore I let not them y=t= like them to wedde them.
MORERIC-E1-P2,63.208

No more is it reason y=t= it mislike any man, y=t= I mary where it
liketh me.  MORERIC-E1-P2,63.209

And I am sure y=t= my cosein of warwik neither loueth me so litle,
to grudge at y=t= I loue, nor is so vnresonable to loke y=t= I shold in
choise of a wife, rather be ruled by hys eye, then by mine own: as though
I wer a ward y=t= wer bound to <P_64> mary by thapointment of a gardain.
MORERIC-E1-P2,64.210

I wold not be a kyng w=t= that condicion, to forbere mine own lyberty
in choise of my own mariage.  MORERIC-E1-P2,64.211

As for possibilitie of more inheritaunce by new affinity in
estraunge landes, is ofte y=e= occasion of more trouble then profite.
MORERIC-E1-P2,64.212

And we haue alredy title by y=t= meanes, to so much as suffiseth to get &
kepe wel in one mans daies.  MORERIC-E1-P2,64.213

That she is a widow & hath alredy children, by gods blessed Ladye I am
a batcheler MORERIC-E1-P2,64.214

& haue some to: MORERIC-E1-P2,64.215

& so eche of vs hath a profe y=t= neither of vs is lyke to be barain.
MORERIC-E1-P2,64.216

And therefore madam I pray you be content, MORERIC-E1-P2,64.217

I trust in god she shal bring furth a young prince, y=t= shal please you.
MORERIC-E1-P2,64.218

And as for y=e= bigamy, let y=e= bishop hardely lay it in my wai, when
I come to take orders.  MORERIC-E1-P2,64.219

For I vnderstand it is forbidden a prieste, MORERIC-E1-P2,64.220

but I neuer wiste it yet y=t= it was forbidden a prince.
MORERIC-E1-P2,64.221

The Duchesse w=t= these wordes nothyng appeased, and seing y=e= king
so set thereon that she coulde not pull him backe, so hyghelye she
dysdained it, y=t= under pretext of her duetye to Godwarde, shee deuised
to disturbe this mariage, and rather to help that he shold mary one
Elizabeth Lucy, whom y=e= king had also not long before gotten w=t= child.
Wherefore y=e= kinges mother obiected openly against his mariage, as it
were in discharge of her conscience, that the kinge was sure to dame
Elizabeth Lucy and her husband before god.  By reson of which wordes,
such obstacle was made in the matter, that either y=e= Bishoppes durst
not, or the king would not, procede to the solempnisacion of this weding,
til these same wer clerely purged, & the trouth wel & openly testified.
Wherupon dame Elysabeth Lucy was sent for.  MORERIC-E1-P2,64.222

And albeit y=t= she was by y=e= kinges mother & many other put in good
<P_65> comfort, to affirme that she was ensured vnto y=e= king: yet
when she was solempnely sworne to say the trouth, she confessed that
they were neuer ensured.  MORERIC-E1-P2,65.223

Howbeit she sayed his grace spake so louing wordes vnto her, y=t= she
verely hopid he wold haue maried her.  And y=t= if it had not ben for
such kind wordes, she would neuer haue shewed such kindenes to him,
to let him so kindly get her w=t= childe.  MORERIC-E1-P2,65.224

This examinacion solempnly taken, when it was clerely perceiued that there
was none impediment: the king w=t= gret feast & honorable solempnite,
maried dame Elisabeth Grai MORERIC-E1-P2,65.225

and her crowned quene y=t= was hys enemies wife, & many time had praied
full hartly for his losse.  In which god loued her better, then to graunt
her her bone.  MORERIC-E1-P2,65.226
