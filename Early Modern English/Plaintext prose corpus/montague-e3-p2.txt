I am very much concernd to heare of the loss of your little girl.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,174.21.4

I thought it had bine grown very stronge, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,174.21.5

but I suppose it twas {COM:sic} <P_1,175> somethinge concerninge the
teeth.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.6

MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.7

I give you a thousand thankes for your kindnes to y=e= girls.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.8

Kattes illness was a feaver, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.9

and left her soe weake and fante that she will be some time before she
can stirr any wither.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.10

I hope to see you aganest the parlim=t= in towne, w=ch= will now bee
very quickly.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.11

I suppose you have all the news from your $brother, who is a great man
amongest the ladyes.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.12

He comes sometimes to us; MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.13

and I am forced to putt him out of doores att night,
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.14

he is such an etternall sitter up att nights.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.15

I am just now come from takeing y=e= oathes and subscribing y=e= Test
in y=e= Court of Chanserie, as all the Queen's servants are to doe.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.16

Yesterday the 3 men acussed by Prance was condemned, att w=ch=
the people made y=e= $grattest show of satisfaction imaginable.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.17

My Lady Gerard was in the Citty taken <paren> in a chaire <$$paren>
to bee y=e= Dutchess of Portsmouth, and called the French whore;
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.18

and soe many gott about the chaire as much frighted $her.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.19

But some w=th= her told who she was.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,175.20

S=r= Jhos: Williamson was told by the Kinge one Sunday morninge he was
noe longer fitt for y=t= employm=t= as the Kinges afferes att this

Sept. 8=th=, $1679 MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.29

I was two dayes att Windsor, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.30

and had the fortune to bee ther when the Duke first come.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.31

It was a great surprise, if not to all, to y=e= greater number, the
Kinge having sent before to him not to come.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.32

But he did noe question expect to finde him much worse then he found him,
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.33

for y=t= daye he begane to walke about the hous.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.34

Ther are severall oppinions wether he will goe back or noe;
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.35

and, till the Kinge remooves from Windsor, I suppose he will not stir.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.36

About the 15 or 16 of this moneth the Kinge speakes of Newmarkett.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.37

The docterrs are much against it, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.38

and, if he goeth not thither, I beleeve will stay y=e= longer att Windsor.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.39

My Lady Montrose is going to morrow for Ireland.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.40

She seems much pleased and willing to goe.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.41

Her sister goeth w=th= her.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.42

My L=d= of E. was not kinde to her, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.43

made y=m= pay for ther board, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.44

and went the next morning after she was married away into y=e= country,
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.45

and left her husband to gett her a dyner as he could.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.46

I wonder how people can doe such thinges.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.47

My L=d= Halifax is become soe great a courtier as never is from y=e=
Kinges elbow.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.48

Thus you see how men change their mindes upon ocasions.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.49

The D. refused S=r= Tho. Armstrong to kiss his hand,
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.50

and, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} said, is very coole to y=e= D. of
Monmouth.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.51

Thus I have told you all the news I know, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.52

and only begg my service to your Lord, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,193.53

and remaine, Your affectionat Aunt and servant, A. Manchester.

Whitehall, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.57

Jan. 23=th= $1680 MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.58

My Lord, I received both your letters att Leez, and soe neare my comeing
back that made mee defere till now wrighten.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.59

M=r= Riggby hath bine w=th= us this Christmass att Leez, wher my Lord
hath concluded w=th= him to travell w=th= my son and to goe about next
Michelmass.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.60

I suppose he designes he shall stay abroad till he bee neare of agge,
w=ch= will bee four yeare att least, if nothinge should ocasion a more
sudden returne then yet wee can foresee.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.61

As to w=t= your L=dsp= saith concerning him, he was gone that morning
towards London when I received your letter, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.62

and that made me defere wrighten till I had acquainted him w=th= it,
w=ch= I did yesterday.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.63

I suppose he will returne himselfe his acknowledgm=ts= to you for your
thoughts of him, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.64

but I guess by his discours that he will bee unwilling to take any
liveing of noe greater value.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.65

He, I suppose, was informed that Willbee was at least $120 =ll=
{TEXT:120=ll=} a yeare, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.66

and the nebourhood of Kerby was y=e= greattes temptation;
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,217.67

besides, beeing to bee abroad soe long w=th= Charles, att his returne
I hope my L=d= may have it in his <P_1,218> power to doe as well
for him, he haveing a great many very good liveings in his gifft;
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.68

and truely I find his preaching, w=ch= I never heard till this time at
Leez, and his conversation, may very reasonably deserve a good one,
espeshallie if he performes his dutty to my son abroad, w=ch= I hope
he will.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.69

As to w=t= neues this plaice afords, tho I suppose you have it from
better hands, yet I will tell you how much pleased wee are here att
Court w=th= the citty, and that the $pettition was not received att
the Comon Councell, tho it was by a very few voices carried against.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.70

They first declared it twas {COM:sic} legall and the right of $every
man to adress that way to the Kinge, and that a parlim=t= was very
needefull to those purposes, but that, believing it twould {COM:sic}
procure a more certane sattisfaction w=th=out, and more ready way to
have ther desiers granted.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.71

Wee are told here that the Dutch have absolutly refuted the French
league and will agree wth us, into w=ch= league the greattes part of
christendome are willingle to entter, to humble the Kinge of France,
if they can, att least that he might not greatten his conquest, w=ch=
is expected he will doe next summer.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.72

$'T $is {TEXT:'Tis} thought the Kinge may have given the Dutch some
privat assurance of assistance, w=ch= makes it hop'd wee may not bee
long w=th=out a parlim=t=.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.73

Next Munday, beeing y=e= day for the prorogation, is impatiently expected,
to see y=e= event of peoples hopes.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.74

Here is strange neues from France.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.75

A great many people of the best quality accused for $poisoning.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,218.76

Madame de Sowison <P_1,219> <paren> Madame Mazerine sister <$$paren>
hath made her escape.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.77

She is said to have bine the death of her husband.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.78

Severall more w=ch= was ingaged in that first murder, to secure her owne
saffety, she hath sent after him.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.79

Madam de Bullion, another sister, is secured, and a great many more.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.80

The Marechall de Luxsomberge is in y=e= Bastill, a paper under his owne
hand being found, a contract made to the divell upon three accounts:
one, never to loose the Kinge's favour; to bee allwayes victouris
and never hurt in battall; and allways prosperous in his love.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.81

Sesak that was here, y=e= great gamester, he hath done y=e= same thing,
that he may winn allwayes att play.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.82

It makes as much discours in France as our plott doth here,
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.83

and y=e= Kinge is much concern'd ther about it.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.84

I begg your L=dsp= pardon for y=e= length of this trouble,
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.85

and remaine, Your most humble servant, A. Manchester.
MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.86

Since I writte, this day, about noone, M=r= Thinn, S=r= Walter St.
John, and S=r= Edward Hungerford, w=th= two or 3 orther gentlemen,
presented the $pettitione from Wiltshiere.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.87

Y=e= K. received y=m= but ruffly, MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.88

asked y=m= from whens it came.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.89

Beeing told, he said that, nether the grand jury nor justices hands
being to it, he wonderd gentlemen would owne anything from a rabble;
that it twas {COM:sic} his right to call parlim=ts= when he thought
it $conveniant, and was y=e= judge of it, and should not doe it y=e=
sooner for this way; MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.90

and soe left y=m=.  MONTAGUE-E3-P2,1,219.91
