The.vi.  Chapter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.3

<$$heading>

In those dayes as the nombre of the disciples grewe, ther arose a
grudge amonge the Grekes agaynste the Ebrues, because their wyddowes
were despysed in the dayly mynystracion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.5

Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to gether
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.6

and sayde: it is not mete that we shuld leave the worde of God and serve
at the tables.  Wherfore brethren, loke ye out amonge you seven men of
honest reporte, and full of the holy goost and wysdome, which we maye
apoynte to this nedfull busynes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.7

But we will geve oure selves continually to prayer, and to the
ministracion of the worde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.8

And the sayinge pleased the whoale multitude.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.9

And they chose Steven a man full of fayth and of the holy goost,
and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nichanor, and Timon, and Permenas, and
Nicholas a converte of Antioche.  Which they set before the Apostles,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.10

and they prayed TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.11

and layde their hondes on them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.12

And the worde of God encreased, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.13

and the noumbre of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.14

and a great company of the prestes were obedient to the faythe.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.15

And Steven full of faythe and power, dyd great wondres and myracles
amonge the people.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.16

Then ther arose certayne of the synagoge, which are called Lybertines
and Syrenites, and of Alexandria, and of Cilicia, and Asia,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.17

and disputed with Steven.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.18

And they coulde not resist the wysdome, and the sprete, with which
he spake.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.19

Then sent they in men, which sayd: we have hearde him speake blasphemous
wordes agaynst Moses, and agaynst God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.20

And they moved the people and the elders and the scribes:
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.21

and came apon him TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.22

and caught him, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.23

and brought him to the counsell, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.24

and brought forth falce witnesses which sayde.  This man ceasith not
to speake blasphemous wordes agaynst this holy place and the lawe:
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.25

for we hearde him saye: this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroye this place,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.26

and shall chaunge the ordinaunces which Moses gave vs.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.27

And all that sate in the counsell loked stedfastly on him,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,6,1A.28

and sawe his face as it had bene the face of an angell.

The.vii.  Chapter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.32

<$$heading>

Then sayde the chefe prest: is it even so?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.34

And he sayde: ye men, brethren and fathers, harken to.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.35

The God of glory appered vnto oure father Abraham whyll he was yet in
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.36

and sayd vnto him: come out of thy contre, and from thy kynred,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.37

and come into the londe, which I shall shewe the.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.38

Then came he out of the londe of Chaldey, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.39

and dwelt in Charran.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.40

And after that, assone as his father was deed, he brought him into this
lande, in which ye now dwell, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.41

and he gave him none inheritaunce in it, no not the bredeth of a fote:
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.42

but promised that he wolde geve it to him to possesse and to his seed
after him, when as yet he had no chylde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.43

God verely spake on this wyse that his seade shulde be a dweller in a
straunge londe and that they shulde kepe them in bondage and entreate
them evyll.iiii.C.  yeares.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.44

But the nation to whom they $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} in bondage will I
iudge, sayde God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.45

And after that shall they come forthe and serve me in this place.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.46

And he gave him the covenaunt of circumcision.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.47

And he begat Isaac, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.48

and circumcised him the viii. daye, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.49

and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarkes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.50

And the patriarkes havinge indignation solde Joseph into Egipte.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.51

And God was with him TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.52

and delivered him out of all his adversities.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.53

And gave him faveour and wisdome in the sight of Pharao kynge of
Egipte which made him governer over Egipte, and over all his housholde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.54

Then came ther a derth over all the londe of Egipt and Canaan, and great
affliccion, that our fathers founde no sustenaunce.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.55

But when Jacob hearde that ther was corne in Egipte, he sent oure fathers
fyrst, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.56

and at the seconde tyme, Ioseph was knowen of his brethren,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.57

and Iosephs kynred was made knowne vnto Pharao.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.58

Then sent Ioseph TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.59

and caused his father to be brought and all his kynne, thre score and
xv. soules.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.60

And Iacob descended into Egipte TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.61

and dyed bothe he and oure fathers, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.62

and were translated into Sichem, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.63

ond were put in the sepulcre that Abraham bought for money of the sonnes
of Emor, at Sichem.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.64

When the tyme of the promes drue nye <paren> which God had $sworne
{TEXT:sworme} to Abraham <$$paren> the people grewe and multiplied
in Egipte, till another kynge arose which knewe not of Joseph.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.65

The same dealte suttelly with oure kynred, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.66

and evyll intreated oure fathers, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.67

and made them to cast oute their younge chyldren, that they shuld not
remayne alyve.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,1A.68

<P_7,20A>

The same tyme was Moses borne, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.70

and was a proper childe in the sight of God, which was norisshed vp in
his fathers housse thre monethes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.71

When he was cast out, Pharoes doughter toke him vp, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.72

and norisshed him vp for her awne sonne.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.73

And Moses was learned in all maner wisdome of the Egipcians,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.74

and was mighty in dedes and in wordes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.75

And when he was full forty yeare olde, it came into his hert to visit
his brethren, the chyldren of Israhel.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.76

And when he sawe one of them suffre wronge, he defended him,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.77

and avenged his quarell that had the harme done to him,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.78

and smote the Egypcian.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.79

For he supposed hys brethren wolde have vnderstonde how that God by his
hondes shuld save them TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.80

But they vnderstode not.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.81

And the next daye he shewed him selfe vnto them as they strove,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.82

and wolde have set them at one agayne sayinge: Syrs, ye are brethren,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.83

why hurte ye one another?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.84

But he that dyd his neghbour wronge, thrust him awaye sayinge: who made
the a rular and a iudge amonge vs?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.85

What, wilt thou kyll me, as thou dyddest the Egyptian yester daye?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.86

Then fleed Moses at that sayenge, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.87

and was a stranger in the londe of Madian, where he begat two sonnes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.88

And when.xl.  yeares were expired, ther appered to him in the wyldernes
of mounte Syna an angell of the Lorde in a flamme of fyre in a busshe.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.89

When Moses sawe it, he wondred at the syght.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.90

And as he drue neare to beholde, the voyce of the Lorde came vnto him:
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.91

I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.92

Moses trembled TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.93

and durst not beholde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.94

Then sayde the Lorde to him: Put of thy showes from thy fete,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.95

for the place where thou stondest, is holy grounde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.96

I have perfectly sene the affliccion of my people which is in Egypte,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.97

and I have hearde their gronynge, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.98

and am come doune to delyver them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.99

And now come and I will sende the into Egypte.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.100

This Moses whom they forsoke sayinge: who made the a ruelar and a judge
: the same God sent bothe a ruler and delyverer, by the hondes of the
angell which appered to him in the busshe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.101

And the same brought them out shewynge wonders and signes in Egypte, and
in the reed see and in the wyldernes.xl.  yeares.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.102

This is that Moses which sayde vnto the chyldren of Israel: A Prophet
shall the Lorde youre God rayse vp vnto you of youre brethren lyke vnto
me, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.103

him shall ye heare.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.104

This is he that was in the congregacion, in the wyldernes with the
angell which spake to him in the mounte Syna, and with oure fathers.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.105

This man receaved the worde of lyfe to geve vnto vs, to whom oure fathers
wolde not obeye but cast it from them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,20A.106

and in their hertes turned backe agayne into Egypte, <P_7,40A> sayinge
vnto Aaron: Make vs goddes to goo before vs.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.107

For this Moses that brought vs out of the londe of Egypte, we wote not
what is become of him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.108

And they made a calfe in those dayes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.109

and offered sacrifice vnto the ymage, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.110

and reioysed in the workes of their awne hondes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.111

Then God turned him selfe; TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.112

and gave them vp, that they shuld worship the starres of the skye,
as it is written in the boke of the prophetes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.113

O ye of the housse of Israel, gave ye to me sacrefices and meate
offerynges, by the space of xl. yeares in the wildernes?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.114

And ye toke vnto you the tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of youre god
Remphan, figures which ye made to worshippe them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.115

And I will translate you beyonde Babylon.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.116

Oure fathers had the tabernacle of witnes in the wyldernes, as he had
apoynted them speakynge vnto Moses, that he shuld make it acordynge to
the fassion that he had sene.  Which tabernacle oure fathers receaved,
and brought it in with Josue into the possession of the gentyls which
God drave out before the face of oure fathers vnto the tyme of David
, which founde favour before God, and desyred that he myght fynde a
tabernacle for the God of Iacob.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.117

$But {TEXT:Bnt} Salomon bylt him an housse.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.118

How be it he that is hyest of all, dwelleth not in temple made with
hondes, as saith the Prophete: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.119

Heven is my seate, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.120

and erth is my fote stole, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.121

what housse will ye bylde for me sayth the Lorde?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.122

or what place is it that I shuld rest in?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.123

hath not my honde made all these thinges?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.124

Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised hertes and eares: ye have all wayes
resisted the holy goost: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.125

as youre fathers dyd, so do ye.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.126

Which of the prophetes have not youre fathers persecuted?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.127

And they have slayne them, which shewed before of the commynge of that
iust, whom ye have now betrayed and mordred.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.128

And ye also have receaved a lawe by the ordinaunce of angels,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.129

and have not kept it.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.130

When they hearde these thinges, their hertes clave a sunder,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.131

and they gnasshed on him with their tethe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.132

But he beynge full of the holy goost, loked vp stedfastlye with his eyes
into heven TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.133

and sawe the glorie of God, and Jesus stondynge on the ryght honde of
God, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.134

and sayde: beholde, I se the hevens open, and the sonne of man stondynge
on the ryght honde of god.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.135

Then they gave a shute with a loude voyce, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.136

and stopped their eares TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.137

and ranne apon him all at once, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.138

and caste him out of the cite, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.139

and stoned him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.140

And the witnesses layde doune their clothes at a yonge mannes fete
named Saul.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.141

And they stoned Steven callynge on and sayinge: Lorde Iesu receave
my sprete.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,40A.142

<P_7,60A>

And he kneled doune TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,60A.144

and cryed with a loude voyce: Lorde laye not this synne to their charge.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,60A.145

And when he had thus spoken, he fell a slepe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,7,60A.146

<P_8,1A>

The.viii.  Chapter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.149

<$$heading>

Saul had pleasure in his deeth.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.151

And at that tyme there was a great persecucion agaynst the congregacion
which was at Ierusalem, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.152

and they were all scattered abroade thorowout the regions of Iury and
Samaria, except the Apostles.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.153

Then devout men dressed Steven, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.154

and made great lamentacion over him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.155

But Saul made havocke of the congregacion entrynge into every housse,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.156

and drewe out bothe man and woman, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.157

and thrust them into preson.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.158

They that were scattered abroade, went every where preachyng the worde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.159

Then came Philip into a cite of Samaria TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.160

and preached Christ vnto them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.161

And the people gave hede vnto those thinges which Philip spake, with
one acorde, in that they hearde and sawe the miracles which he dyd.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.162

For vnclene spretes cryinge with loude voyce, came out of many that were
possessed of them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.163

And manye taken with palsies, and many that halted, were healed
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.164

And ther was great ioye in that cite.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.165

And ther was a certayne man called Simon, which before tyme in the same
cite, vsed witche crafte and bewitched the people of Samarie, sayinge,
that he was a man that coulde do greate thinges.  Whom they regarded,
from the lest to the greatest, sayinge: this felow is the great power
of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.166

And him they set moche by, because of longe tyme with sorcery he had
mocked them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.167

But assone as they beleved Philippes preachynge of the kyngdome of God
and of the name of Iesu Christ, they were baptised bothe men and wemen.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.168

Then Simon him selfe beleved also, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.169

and was baptised, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.170

and continued with Phillip, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.171

and wondered beholdynge the miracles and signes, which were shewed.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.172

When the Apostles which were at Jerusalem hearde saye that Samaria had
receaved the worde of God: they sent vnto them, Peter and Iohn, which
when they were come, prayed for them, that they myght receave the holy
goost TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.173

For as yet he was come on none of them: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.174

But they were baptised only in the name of Christ Iesu.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.175

Then layde they their hondes on them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.176

and they receaved the holy goost.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.177

When Simon sawe, that thorowe layinge on of the Apostles hondes on them,
the holy goost was geven: he offered them money sayinge: Geve me also
this power, that on whom soever I put the hondes, he maye receave the
holy goost.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,1A.178

<P_8,20A>

Then sayde Peter vnto him: thy monye perysh with the, because
thou wenest that the gifte of God maye be obteyned with money.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.180

Thou hast nether parte nor felloushippe in this busines.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.181

For thy hert is not ryght in the syght of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.182

Repent therfore of this thy wickednes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.183

and praye God that the thought of thyne hert maye be forgeven the.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.184

For I perceave that thou arte full of bitter gall, and wrapped in
iniquite.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.185

Then answered Simon TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.186

and sayde: Praye ye to the lorde for me that none of these thinges whiche
ye have spoken, fall on me.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.187

And they, when they had testified and preached the worde of the lorde,
returned toward Jerusalem, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.188

and preached the gospell in many cities of the Samaritans.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.189

Then the angell of the lorde spake vnto Phillip sayinge: aryse
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.190

and goo towardes mydde daye vnto the waye that goeth doune from Ierusalem
vnto Gaza which is in the desert.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.191

And he arose TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.192

and went on.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.193

And beholde a man of Ethiopia which was a chamberlayne, and of grete
auctorite with Candace quene of the Ethiopians, and had the rule of all
her treasure, came to Jerusalem forto praye.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.194

And as he returned home agayne sittynge in his charet, he rede Esay
the prophet.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.195

Then the sprete sayde unto Phillip: Goo neare TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.196

and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.197

And Philip ranne to him, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.198

and hearde him rede the prophet Esayas TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.199

and sayde: Vnderstondest thou what thou redest?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.200

And he sayd: how can I, except I had a gyde?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.201

And he desyred Philip that he wold come vp and sit with him.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.202

The tenoure of the scripture which he redde, was this.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.203

He was ledde as a shepe to be slayne: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.204

and lyke a lambe domme before his sherer, so opened he not his mouth.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.205

Because of his humblenes, he was not estemed: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.206

who shall declare his generacion?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.207

for his lyfe is taken from the erthe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.208

The chamberlayne answered Philip TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.209

and sayde: I praye the, of whom speaketh the Prophet this?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.210

of him selfe, or of some other man?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.211

And Philip opened his mouth, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,8,20A.212

<P_9,20A>

And streyght waye he preached Christ in the synagoges, how that he was

But when the brethren knew of that, they brought hym to cesarea,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,9,20A.301

and sent hym forth to Tharsus.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,9,20A.302

Then had the congregacions rest thorowoute all Jewry and galile and

And she opened her eyes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,9,40A.329

And he gave her the honde TYNDNEW-E1-P2,9,40A.331

And it was knowne throwout all Ioppa, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,9,40A.335

Ther was a certayne man in Cesarea called Cornelius, a captayne of the
soudiers of Italy, a devoute man, and one that feared God with all his
housholde, which gave moche almes to the people, and prayde God alwaye.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.342

The same man sawe in a vision evydently aboute the nynthe houre of the
daye an angell of god comynge into him, and sayinge vnto him: Cornelius.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.343

When he looked on him, he was afrayde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.344

and sayde: what is it lorde?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.345

He sayde vnto him.  Thy prayers and thy almeses ar come vp into
remembraunce before God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.346

And now sende men to Ioppa, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.347

and call for one Simon named also Peter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.348

He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose housse is by the see syde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.349

He shall tell the, what thou oughtest, to doo.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.350

When the angell which spake vnto Cornelius was departed, he called two
of his housholde servauntes, and a devoute soudier of them that wayted
on him, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.351

and tolde them all the mater, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.352

and sent them to Ioppa.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.353

On the morowe as they went on their iorney and drewe nye vnto the cite,
Peter went vp into the toppe of the housse to praye, aboute the.vi.
houre.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.354

Then wexed he an hongred, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.355

But whyll they made redy.  He fell into a traunce, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.357

And ther came a voyce to him: ryse Peter, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.359

But Peter sayde: God forbyd Lorde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.361

for I have never eaten eny thinge that is comen or vnclene.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.362

And the voyce spake vnto him agayne the seconde tyme: what God hath
clensed, that make thou not comen.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.363

This was done thryse, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.364

and the vessell was receaved vp agayne into heven.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.365

Whyle Peter mused in him selfe what this vision which he had sene meant,
beholde, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had made inquirance
for Simons housse, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.366

and stode before the dore.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.367

And called out won TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.368

TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,1A.369

Whyll Peter thought on this vision, the sprete sayde vnto him: Beholde,

<P_10,20A>

aryse therfore, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.372

For I have sent them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.376

Peter went doune to the men which were sent vnto him from Cornelius,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.377

and sayde, Beholde, I am he whom ye seke, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.378

what is the cause wherfore ye are come?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.379

And they sayde vnto him: Cornelius the captayne a iust man, and won that

warned by an holy angell, to sende for the into his housse, and to heare
wordes of the.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.380

Then called he them in, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.381

and lodged them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.382

And on the morowe Peter went awaye with them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.383

and certayne brethren from Ioppa accompanyed hym.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.384

And the thyrd daye entred they into Cesaria.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.385

And Cornelius wayted for them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.386

and had called to gether his kynsmen, and speciall frendes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.387

And as it chaunsed Peter to come in, Cornelius met hym,

and fell doune at his fete, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.389

and founde many that were come to gether.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.394

And $he $sayde {TEXT:hesayde} vnto them: Ye $do $knowe {TEXT:doknowe}

But god hath shewed me that I shuld not call eny man commen or vnclene:

therfore came I vnto you with oute sayenge naye assone as I was sent for.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.397

I axe therfore, for what intent have ye sent for me?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.398

And Cornelius sayde: This daye now.iiii.  dayes I fasted,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.399

and at the nynthe houre I prayde in my housse: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.400

and beholde, a man stode before me in bright clothynge,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.401

and sayde: Cornelius, thy prayer is hearde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.402

and thyne almes dedes are had in remembraunce in the sight of God.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.403

Sende therfore to Ioppa, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.404

and call for Simon which is also called Peter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.405

He is lodged in the housse of one Simon a tanner by the see syde, the wich
assone as he is come, shall speake vnto the.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.406

Then sent I for the immediatly TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.407

Now are we all here present before god, to heare all thynges that are
commaunded unto the of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.409

Then Peter opened his mouth TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.410

and sayde: Of a trueth I perseave, that God is not parciall, but in all
people TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.411

he that feareth him and worketh rightewesnes, is accepted with him.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.412

Ye knowe the preachynge that God sent vnto the chyldren of Israel,
preachinge peace by Jesus Christe, <paren> which is Lorde over all
thinges: <$$paren> Which preachinge was publisshed thorow oute all
Iewrye, and beganne in Galile, after the baptyme which Iohn preached,
how God had annoynted Jesus of Nazareth with the holy goost, and with

oppressed of the develles, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.413

for God was with him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.414

And we are witnesses of all thinges which he dyd in the londe of
the Iewes and at Ierusalem, whom they slew, and honge on tree.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,20A.415

<P_10,40A>

Him God reysed vp the thyrde daye, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.417

and shewed him openly, not to all the people, but vnto vs witnesses chosyn
before of God, which ate and dronke with him, after he arose from deeth.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.418

And he commaunded vs to preache vnto the people and testifie,
that it is he that is ordened of God a iudge of quycke and deed.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.419

To him geve all the Prophetes witnes, that thorowe his name shall receave
remission of synnes all that beleve in him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.420

Whyle Peter yet spake these wordes, the holy gost fell on all them which
hearde the preachinge.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.421

And they of the circumcision which beleved, were astonyed, as many as
came with Peter, because that on the Gentyls also was sheed oute the
gyfte of the holy gost.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.422

For they hearde them speake with tonges and magnify God.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.423

Then answered Peter: can eny man forbyd water that these shuld
not be baptised, which have receaved the holy goost as well as we?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.424

And he commaunded them to be baptysed in the name of the Lorde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,10,40A.425

reasoned wyth him sayinge Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.432

and atest with them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.433

Then Peter began TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.434

and expounded the thinge in order to them sayinge: I was in the cyte of
Ioppa prayinge, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.435

and in a traunce I sawe a vision, a certen vessell descende, as it had
bene a large lynnyn clothe, let doune from hevin by the fower corners,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.436

and it cam to me.  Into the which when I had fastened myn eyes,
I consydered and sawe fowerfoted beastes of the erth, and vermen and
wormes, and foules of the ayer.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.437

And I herde a voyce sayinge vnto me: aryse Peter, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.438

sley and eate.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.439

And I sayd: God forbyd lorde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.440

for nothinge comen or vnclene, hath at eny tyme entred into my mouth.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.441

But the voyce answered me agayne from heven, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.442

count not thou those thinges comen, which god hath clensed.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.443

And this was done thre tymes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.444

And all were takin vp agayne into heven.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.445

And beholde immediatly ther were thre men come vnto the housse where I
was, sent from Cesarea vnto me.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.446

And the sprete sayde vnto me, that I shuld go with them, with out
doutinge.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.447

Morover the sixe brethren accompanyed me: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.448

and we entred into the mans housse.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.449

And he shewed vs, how he had sene an angell in his housse, which stod and
sayde to him: Send men to Ioppa, and call for Symon, named also Peter:
he shall tell the wordes, wher by both thou and all thyne housse $shall
$be {TEXT:shalbe} saved.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.450

And as I beganne to preach, the holy goost fell on them, as he dyd on
vs at the begynninge.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.451

Then came to my remembraunce the wordes of the Lorde, how he sayde:
Iohn baptised with water, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.452

but ye $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} baptysed with the holy goost.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.453

For as moche then as God gave them lyke gyftes, as he dyd vnto vs, when
we beleved on the Lorde Jesus Christ: what was I that I shuld $have
$withstonde {TEXT:havewith_stonde} God?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.454

when they hearde this, they helde their peace TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.455

and gloryfied God, sayinge: then hath God also to the gentyls graunted
repentaunce vnto lyfe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.456

They which were scattryd abroade thorow the affliccion that arose aboute
Steven, walked thorow oute tyll they came vnto Phenices and Cypers
and Antioche, preachynge the worde to no man, but vnto the Iewes only.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,1A.457

<P_11,20A>

Some of them were men of Cypers and Syrene, which when they were come
into Antioche, spake vnto the Grekes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.459

and preched the Lorde Jesus TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.460

And the honde of the Lorde was with them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.461

and a greate nombre beleved TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.462

and turned vnto the Lorde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.463

Tydinges of these thinges came vnto the eares of the congregacion,
which was in Ierusalem.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.464

And they sente forth Barnabas that he shuld go vnto Antioche.  Which when
he was come, and had sene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted
them all, that with purpose of hert they wolde continually cleave vnto
the Lorde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.465

For he was a good man, and full of the holy goost and of faythe:
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.466

and moche people was added vnto the Lorde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.467

Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seke Saul.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.468

And when he had founde him, he brought him vnto Antioche.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.469

And it chaunsed that a whole yere they had their conversacion with
the congregacion there, and taught moche people: in somoche that
the disciples of Antioche were the fyrst that were called Christen.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.470

In those dayes came Prophetes from Ierusalem vnto Antioche.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.471

And ther stode vp one of them, named Agabus, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.472

and signified by the sprete, that ther shuld be great derth throughoute
all the worlde, which came to passe in the Emproure Claudius dayes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.473

Then the disciples every man accordinge to his abilite, purposed to sende
socoure vnto the brethren which dwelt in Jewry.  Which thinge they also
dyd, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,11,20A.474

and sent it to the elders, by the hondes of Barnabas and Saul.

In that tyme Herode the kynge stretched forthe his handes to vexe certayne
of the congregacion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.480

And he kylled Iames the brother of Iohn with the swerde:
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.481

and because he sawe that it pleased the Iewes, he proceded forther,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.482

and toke Peter also.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.483

Then were the dayes of swete breed.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.484

And when he had caught him, he put him in preson, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.485

and delyvered him to.iiii.  quaternions of soudiers to $be $kepte
{TEXT:bekepte}, entendynge after ester to brynge him forth to the people.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.486

Then was Peter kepte in preson.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.487

But prayer was made with out ceasynge of the congregacion vnto God
for him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.488

And when Herode wolde have brought him oute vnto the people, the same
nyght slepte Peter bitwene two soudiers, bounde with two chaynes,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.489

and the kepers before the dore kepte the preson.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.490

And beholde the angell of the Lorde was there present,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.491

and a lyght shyned in the lodge.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.492

And smote Peter on the syde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.493

and steryd him vp sayinge: aryse vp quyckly.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.494

And his cheynes fell of from his hondes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.495

And the angell sayd unto him: gyrde thy selfe TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.496

and bynde on thy sandales.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.497

And so he dyd.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.498

And he sayde vnto him: cast thy mantle aboute the, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.499

and folowe me.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.500

And he came oute TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.501

and folowed him, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.502

and wist not, that it was truthe which was done by the angell,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.503

but thought he had sene a vision.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.504

When they were past the fyrst and the seconde watche, they came vnto
the yron gate, that ledeth vnto the cyte, which opened to them by his
awne accorde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.505

And they went out TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.506

and passed thorowe one strete, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.507

and by and by the angell departed from him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.508

And when Peter was come to him selfe, he sayde: now I knowe of a surety
, that the Lorde hath sent his angell, and hath delyvered me out of the
honde of Herode, and from all the waytynge for of the people of the Iewes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.509

And as he consydred the thinge, he cam to the housse of Mary the mother
of one Iohn, which was called Marke also, where many were gaddered to
gedder in prayer.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.510

As Peter knocked at the entry dore, a damsell cam forth to herken,
named Rhoda.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.511

And $when $she {TEXT:whenshe} knew Peters voyce, she opened not the
entrey for gladnes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.512

but ran in TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.513

and told how Peter stode before the entrey.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.514

And they sayde vnto her: thou arte mad.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.515

And she bare them doune that it was even so.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.516

Then sayde they: it is his angell.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.517

Peter contynued knockinge.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.518

When they bad opened the dore, and sawe him, they were astonyed.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.519

And he beckened vnto them with the honde to holde their peace,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.520

and tolde them by what meanes the Lorde had brought him oute of the
preson.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.521

And sayde: goo TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.522

shew these thinges vnto Iames and to the brethren.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.523

And he departed TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.524

and went into a nother place: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.525

Assone as it was daye ther was no lyttell a do amonge the soudyers,
what was becum of Peter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.526

When Herode had called for him, and founde him not, he examined the
kepers, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.527

and comaunded to departe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.528

And he descended from Jewry to Cesarea, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.529

and ther abode.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,1A.530

<P_12,20A>

Herode was displeased with them of Tyre and Sydon.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.532

And they came all at once, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.533

and made intercession unto Blastus the kynges chamberlen,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.534

and desyred peace, because their countrey was norysshed by the kynges
londe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.535

And vpon a daye appoynted Herode arayed him in royall apparell,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.536

and set him in his seate, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.537

and made an oraycon vnto them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.538

And the people gave a shoute, sayinge: it is the voyce of a God and not
of a man.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.539

And immediatly the angell of the Lorde smote him, because he gave not
God the honoure, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.540

and he was eatyn of wormes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.541

and gave vp the goost.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.542

And the worde of God grewe and multiplied.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.543

And Barnabas and Paul returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled
their office, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,12,20A.544

and toke with them Iohn, which was also called Marcus.

The.xiii.  Chapter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.548

<$$heading>

There were at Antioche, in the congregacion certayne Prophetes
and teachers: as Barnabas and Simon called Niger, and Lucius of
Cerene, and Manahen Herode the Tetrarkes norsfelowe, and Saul.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.550

As they mynistred to the Lorde and fasted, the holy goost sayde: separate
me Barnabas and Saul, for the worke where vnto I have called them.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.551

Then fasted they TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.552

and prayed, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.553

and put their hondes on them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.554

and let them goo.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.555

And they after they were sent of the holy goost, came vnto Seleutia,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.556

and from thence they sayled to Cyprus.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.557

And when they were come to Salamine, they shewed the worde of God in
the synagoges, of the Jewes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.558

And they had Iohn to their minister.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.559

When they had gone thorowout the yle vnto the cite of Paphos, they founde
a certayne sorserer, a falce prophet which was a Iewe, named Bariesu,
which was with the ruler of the countre won Sergius Paulus a prudent man.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.560

The same ruler called vnto him Barnabas and Saul, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.561

and desyred to heare the worde of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.562

But Elemas the sorcerar <paren> for so was his name by interpretacion
<$$paren> with stode them: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.563

and sought to turne awaye the ruler from the fayth.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.564

Then Saul which also is called Paul beinge full of the holy goost,
set his eyes on him, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.565

and sayde: O full of all sutteltie and disseytfulnes, the chylde of the
devyll, and the enemye of all righteousnes thou ceasest not to pervert
the strayght wayes of the Lorde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.566

And now beholde the honde of the Lorde is vpon the,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.567

and thou shalt be blinde and not se the sunne for a season.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.568

And immediatly ther fell on him a myste and a darcknes,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.569

and he went aboute sekinge them that shuld leade him by the honde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.570

Then the rular when he sawe what had happened, beleved,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.571

and wondred at the doctryne of the Lorde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.572

When they that were with Paule, were departed by shyppe from Paphos,
they cam to Perga a cite of Pamphilia: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.573

and there Iohn departed from them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.574

and returned to Ierusalem.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.575

But they wandred thorowe the countres, from Perga to Antioche a cite of
the countre of Pisidia, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.576

and went in to the synagoge on the saboth daye, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.577

and sate doune.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.578

And after the lawe and the Prophetes were redde, the rulers of the
synagoge sent vnto them sayinge: Ye men and brethren, yf ye have eny
sermon to exhorte the people, saye on.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.579

Then Paul stode vp TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.580

and beckened with the honde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.581

and sayde: Men of Israel, and ye that feare God, geve audience.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.582

The God of this people chose oure fathers, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.583

and exalted the people when they dwelt as straungers in the londe of
Egypt, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.584

and with a mighty arme brought them oute of it, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.585

and aboute the tyme of.xl.  yeares suffred he their maners in the
wyldernes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.586

And he destroyed.vii.  nacions in the londe of Canaan,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.587

and devided their londe to them by lot.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,1A.588

<P_13,20A>

And after warde he gave vnto them iudges aboute the space of.iiii.C.  and
.l.  yeres vnto the tyme of Samuel the Prophet.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.590

And after that they desyred a kinge, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.591

and God gave vnto them Saul the sonne of Cis, a man of the tribe of
Beniamin, by the space of.xl.  yeres.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.592

And after he had put him doune, he set vp David to be their kynge,
of whome he reported sayinge: I have founde David the sonne of Iesse,
a man after myne awne hert, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.593

he shall fulfill all my will.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.594

Of this mannes seed hath God <paren> accordinge to his promes <$$paren>
brought forth to the people of Israel a saviour, one Iesus, when Iohn had
fyrst preached before his comminge the baptyme of repentaunce to Israel.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.595

And when Iohn had fulfylled his course, he sayde: whome ye thinke that
I am, the same am I not.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.596

But beholde ther cometh one after me, whose shewes of his fete I am not
worthy to lowse.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.597

Ye men and brethren, chyldren of the generacion of Abraham, and
whosoever amonge you feareth God, to you is this worde of salvacion sent.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.598

The inhabiters of Jerusalem and their rulers, because they knewe him not
, nor yet the voyces of the Prophetes which are redde every Saboth daye,
they have fulfilled them in condempninge him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.599

And when they founde no cause of deeth in him, yet desyred they Pylate
to kyll him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.600

And when they had fulfilled all that were written of him, they toke him
doune from the tree TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.601

and put him in a sepulcre.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.602

But God raysed him agayne from deeth, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.603

and he was sene many dayes of them which came with him from
Galile to Jerusalem.  Which are his witnesses vnto the people.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.604

And we declare vnto you, how that the promes made vnto the fathers,
God hath fulfilled vnto vs their chyldren, in that he reysed vp Jesus
agayne even as it is written in the fyrste psalme: Thou arte my sonne,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.605

this same daye begat I the.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.606

As concernynge that he reysed him vp from deeth, now no more to returne
to corrupcion, he sayde on this wyse: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.607

The holy promyses made to David I will geve them faithfully to you.
Wherfore he saith also in another place: Thou shalt not soffre thyne
holye to se corrupcion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.608

Howbe it David after he had in his tyme fulfilled the will of God,
he slepte, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.609

and was layde with his fathers, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.610

and sawe corrupcion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.611

But he whom God reysed agayne, sawe no corrupcion.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.612

Be it knowne vnto you therfore ye men and brethren, that thorow this man
is preached vnto you the forgevenes of synnes, and that by him are all
that beleve justified from all thinges from the which ye coulde not be
iustified by the lawe of Moses.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,20A.613

<P_13,40A>

Beware therfore lest that fall on you, which is spoken of in the
Prophetes: Be holde ye despisers TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.615

and wonder, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.616

and perishe ye: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.617

for I do aworke in youre dayes, which ye shall not beleve, yf a man
wolde declare it you.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.618

When they were come out of the Synagoge of the Iewes, the gentyls besought
that they wolde preache the worde to them bitwene the Saboth dayes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.619

When the congregacion was broken vp, many of the Jewes and verteous
convertes folowed Paul and Barnabas, which spake to them and exhorted
them to continue in the grace of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.620

And the nexte Saboth daye, came almoste the whole cite to gether, to
heare the worde of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.621

When the Iewes sawe the people, they were full of indignacion
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.622

and spake agaynst those thinges which were spoken of Paul, spekinge
agaynst it, and raylinge on it.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.623

Then Paul and Barnabus wexed bolde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.624

and sayde: it was mete that the worde of God shulde fyrst have bene
preached to you.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.625

But seinge ye put it from you, and thinke youre selfes onworthy of
everlastinge lyfe: lo, we turne to the gentyls.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.626

For so hath the Lorde commaunded vs: I have made the a light to
the gentyls, that thou be salvacion vnto the ende of the worlde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.627

The gentyls hearde TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.628

and were glad TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.629

and glorified the worde of the Lorde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.630

TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.631

And the worde of the Lorde was publisshed thorowe oute all the region.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.632

But the Jewes moved the worshypfull and honorable wemen, and the chefe
men of the cyte, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.633

and reysed persecucion agaynst Paul and Barnabas, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.634

and expelled them oute of their costes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.635

And they shouke of the duste of their fete agaynste them,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.636

and came vnto Iconium.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,13,40A.637

And the disciples were filled with ioye and with the holy goost.

And it fortuned in Iconium that they went both to gether into the synagoge
of the Jewes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.643

and so spake, that a gret multitude both of the Iewes and also of the
Grekes beleved.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.644

But the vnbelevinge Jewes, steryd vp TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.645

and vnquyeted the myndes of the Gentyls agaynste the brethren.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.646

Longe tyme a bode they there TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.647

and quyt them selves boldly with the helpe of the Lorde, the which gave
testimony vnto the worde of his grace, and caused signes and wondres to
be done by their hondes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.648

The people of the cyte were devided: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.649

and parte helde with the Jewes, and parte with the Apostles.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.650

When ther was a saute made both of the gentyls and also of the Iewes
with their rulers, to put them to shame and to stone them, they were
ware of it, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.651

and fled vnto Listra and Derba, cities of Licaonia, and vnto the region
that lyeth round aboute, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.652

and there preached the gospell.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.653

And ther sate a certayne man at Listra weake in his fete, beinge creple
from his mothers wombe, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.654

and never walkyd.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.655

The same hearde Paul preache.  Which behelde him and perceaved that he
had fayth to be whole, and sayd with a loude voyce: stond vp right on
thy fete.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.656

And he stert vp, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.657

and walked.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.658

And when the people sawe what Paul had done, they lifte vp their voyces,
sayinge in the speache of Lycaonia: Goddes are come doune to vs in the
lyknes of men.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.659

And they called Barnabas Iupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because he was
the preacher.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.660

Then Iupiters Preste, which dwelt before their cite, brought oxen and
garlondes vnto the churche porche, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.661

and wolde have done sacrifise with the people.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.662

But when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul herde that, they rent their
clothes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.663

and ran in amonge the people, cryinge and sayinge: syrs, why do ye this?
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.664

We are mortall men lyke unto you, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.665

and preache unto you, that ye shuld turne from these vanyties vnto the
lyvinge God, which made heaven and erth and the see and all that in

Neverthelesse he lefte not him selfe with outen witnes, in that he shewed
his benefites, in gevinge vs rayne from heaven and frutefull ceasons,
fyllinge oure hertes with fode and gladnes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.667

And with these sayinges, scarse {TEXT:scase} refrayned they the people,
that they had not done sacrifice vnto them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.668

Thither came certayne Jewes, from Antioche and Iconium,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.669

and optayned the peoples consent TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.670

and stoned Paul, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.671

and drewe him oute of the cyte, supposynge he had bene deed.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,1A.672

<P_14,20A>

How be it as the disciples stode rounde about him, he arose vp
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.674

and cam into the cyte.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.675

And the nexte daye he departed with Barnabas to Derba.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.676

After they had preached to that cite and had taught many, they returned
agayne to Listra, and to Iconium and Antioche, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.677

and strengthed the disciples soules, exhortinge them to continue in the
faith, affyrminge that we must thorowe moche tribulacion entre into the
kyngdome of God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.678

And when they had ordened them elders by eleccion in every congregacion
, after they had prayde and fasted, they comended them to God on whom
they beleved.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.679

And they went thorow out Pisidia TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.680

and came into Pamphilia, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.681

and when they had preached the worde of God in Perga, they descended in
to Attalia, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.682

and thence departed by shippe to Antioche, from whence they were
delivered vnto the grace of God, to the worke which they had fulfilled.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.683

When they were come and had gaddered the congregacion to gedder, they
rehersed all that God had done by them, and how he had opened the dore
of faith vnto the gentyls.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,14,20A.684

Then cam certayne from Iewrie, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.690

and taught the brethren: excepte ye be circumcysed after the maner of
Moses, ye $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be saved.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.691

And when ther was rysen dissencion and disputinge not alitle vnto Paul
and Barnabas agaynst them.  They determined that Paul and Barnabas and
certayne other of them shuld ascende to Jerusalem vnto the Apostles and
elders aboute this question.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.692

And after they were brought on their waye by the congregacion, they
passed over Phenices and Samaria, declarynge the conuersion of the
gentyls, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.693

and they brought great ioye vnto all the brethren.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.694

And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were receaved of the
congregacion and of the Apostles and elders.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.695

And they declared what thinges God had done by them.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.696

Then arose ther vp certayne that were of the secte of the Pharises and
dyd beleve sayinge, that it was nedfull to circumcise them and to enioyne
them to kepe the lawe of Moses.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.697

And the Apostles and elders came to geder to reason of this matter.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.698

And when ther was moche disputinge, Peter rose vp TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.699

and sayde vnto them: Ye men and brethren, ye knowe how that a good whyle
agoo, God chose amonge vs that the gentyls by my mouth shuld heare the
worde of the gospell and beleve.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.700

And God which knoweth the herte, bare them witnes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.701

and gave vnto them the holy goost, even as he dyd vnto vs,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.702

and he put no difference bitwene them and vs, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.703

but with fayth $purified $their {TEXT:purifiedtheir} hertes.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.704

Now therfore why tempte ye God, that ye wolde put a yoke on the

TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.705

But we beleve that thorowe the grace of the Lorde Iesu Christ we $shall
$be {TEXT:shalbe} saved, as they doo.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.706

Then all the multitude was peased TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.707

and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, which tolde what
signes and wondres God had shewed amonge the gentyls, by them.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.708

And when they helde their peace, Iames answered sayinge: Men and brethren
herken vnto me.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.709

Simeon tolde how God at the begynnynge dyd visit the gentyls, and receaved
of them, people vnto his name.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.710

And to this agreith the wordes of the Prophetes, as it is written.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.711

After this I will returne, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.712

and wyll bylde agayne the tabernacle of David which is fallen doune,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.713

and that which is fallen in dekey of it, will I bilde agayne,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.714

and I will set it vp, that the residue of men might seke after the Lorde,
and also the gentyls vpon whom my name is named saith the Lorde, which
doth all these thinges: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,1A.715

known vnto God are all his workes from the begynninge of the worlde.
Wherfore my sentence is, that we trouble not them which from amonge the
gentyls, are turned to God: <P_15,20A> but that we write vnto them that
they abstayne them selves from filthynes of ymages, from fornicacion,
from stranglyd and from bloude.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.716

For Moses of olde tyme hath in every cite that preache him,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.717

and he is rede in the synagoges every saboth daye.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.718

Then pleased it the Apostles and elders with the whole congregacion, to
sende chosyn men of their owne company to Antioche with Paul and Barnabas.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.719

They sent Iudas called also Barsabas and Silas, which were chefe men
amonge the brethren, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.720

and gave them lettres in their hondes after this maner.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.721

The Apostles, elders and brethren send gretynges vnto the
brethren which are of the gentyls in Antioche, Siria and Celicia.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.722

For as moche as we have hearde that certayne which departed from vs,
have troubled you with wordes, and combred youre myndes sayinge: Ye must
be circumcised and kepe the lawe, to whom we gave no soche commaundement.
It semed therfore to vs a good thinge, when we were come to gedder with
one accorde, to sende chosyn men vnto you, with oure beloved Barnabas
and Paul, men that have ieoperded their lyves for the name of oure Lorde
Iesus Christ.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.723

We have sent therfore Iudas and Sylas, which shall also tell you the
same thinges by mouth.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.724

For it semed good to the holy gost and to vs, to put no grevous thinge
to you more then these $necessary $thinges {TEXT:necessarythinges}: that
is to saye, that ye abstayne from thinges offered to ymages, from bloud,
from strangled and fornicacion.  From which yf ye kepe youre selves,
ye shall do well.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.725

So fare ye well.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.726

When they were departed, they came to Antioche TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.727

and gaddred the multitude togeder TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.728

and delyvered the pistle.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.729

When they had redde it, they reioysed of that consolacion.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.730

And Iudas and Sylas beinge prophetes, exhorted the brethren with moche
preachynge, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.731

and strengthed them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.732

And after they had taryed there a space, they were let goo in peace of
the brethren vnto the Apostles.  Not with stondynge it pleasyd Sylas to
abyde there still.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.733

Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioche teachynge and preachynge the
worde of the Lorde with other many.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.734

But after a certayne space, Paul sayde vnto Barnabas: Let vs goo agayne
and visite oure brethren in every cite where we have shewed the worde
of the Lorde, and se how they do.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.735

And Barnabas gave counsell to take with them Iohn, called also Marke.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.736

But Paul thought it not mete to take him vnto their company whiche
departed from them at Pamphylia, and went not with them to the worke.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,20A.737

And the dissencion was so sharpe bitwene them, that they departed a sunder
one from the other: so that Barnabas toke Marke and sayled vnto Cypers.
<P_15,40A> And Paul chose Sylas and departed delyvered of the brethren
vnto the grace of god.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,40A.738

And he went thorowe all Cyria and Cilicia, stablisshynge the
congregacions.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,15,40A.739

<$$heading>

Then came he to Derba and to Lystra.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.744

And beholde a certayne disciple was there named Timotheus, a womans
sonne which was a Iewas and beleved: but his father was a Greke.
Of whom reported well, the brethren of Lystra and of Iconium.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.745

The same Paul wolde that he shuld goo forth with him,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.746

and toke TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.747

and circumcised him because of the Jewes, which were in those quarters :
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.748

for they knewe all that his father was a Greke.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.749

As they went thorow the cities, they delyvered them the decrees for
to kepe, ordeyned of the Apostles and elders which were at Ierusalem.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.750

And so were the congregacions stablisshed in the fayth,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.751

and encreased in noumbre dayly.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.752

When they had goone thorow out Phrigia, and the region of Galacia, and
were forbydden of the holy gost to preach the worde in Asia, they came
to Misia, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.753

and sought to goo into Bethinia.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.754

But the sprete soffered them not.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.755

Then they went over Misia, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.756

and cam doune to Troada.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.757

And a vision appered to Paul in the nyght.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.758

There stode a man of Macedonia TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.759

and prayed him sayinge: come into Macedonia TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.760

and helpe vs.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.761

After he had sene the vision, immediatly we prepared to goo into
Macedonia, certified that the lorde had called vs for to preache the
gospell vnto them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.762

Then lowsed we forth from Troada, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.763

and with a strayght course came to Samothracia, and the nexte daye to
Neapolim, and from thence to Philippos, which is the chefest citie in
the partes of Macedonia, and a fre citie.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.764

We were in that cite abydynge a certayne dayes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.765

And on the saboth dayes we went out of the cite besydes a ryver where
men were wont to praye, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.766

and we sate doune TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.767

and spake vnto the wemen which resorted thyther: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.768

And a certayne woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the cite of
Thiatira, which worshipped God, gave vs audience.  Whose hert the
Lorde opened that she attended vnto the thinges which Paul spake.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.769

When she was baptised and her housholde, she besought vs sayinge
: Yf ye thinke that I beleve on the Lorde, come into my housse,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.770

and abyde there.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.771

And she constrayned vs.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.772

And it fortuned as we went to prayer, a certayn damsell possessed with
a sprete that prophesied, met vs, which brought her master and mastres
moche vauntage with prophesyinge.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.773

The same folowed Paul and vs TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.774

and cryed sayinge: these men are the servauntes of the most hye God,
which shewe vnto vs the waye of salvacion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.775

And this dyd she many dayes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.776

But Paul not content, turned about TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.777

and sayd to the sprete: I commaunde the in the name of Iesu Christ,
that thou come out of her.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.778

And he came out the same houre.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.779

And when her master and mastres sawe that the hope of their gaynes was
gone, they caught Paul and Sylas, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.780

and drue them into the market place vnto the rulars,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,1A.781

<P_16,20A>

and brought them to the officers sayinge: These men trouble oure
cite , which are Iewes and preache ordinaunces, which are not
laufull for vs to receave, nether to observe, seinge we are Romayns.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.783

And the people ranne on them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.784

and the officers rent their clothes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.785

and commaunded them to be beaten with roddes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.786

And when they had beaten them sore, they cast them into preson,
commaundynge the iayler to kepe them surely.  Which iayler when he had
receaved suche commaundment, thrust them into the ynner preson, and made
their fete fast in the stockes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.787

At mydnyght Paul and Sylas prayed, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.788

and lauded God.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.789

And the presoners hearde them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.790

And sodenly ther was a greate erth quake, so that the fonndacion of the
preson was shaken, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.791

and by and by all the dores opened, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.792

and every mannes bondes were lowsed.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.793

When the keper of the preson waked out of his slepe and sawe the preson
dores open, he drue out his swearde TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.794

and wolde have kylled him selfe, supposynge the presoners had bene fledde.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.795

But Paul cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge: Do thy selfe no harme,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.796

for we are all heare.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.797

Then he called for a lyght TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.798

and sprange in, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.799

and came tremblynge, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.800

and fell doune before Paul and Sylas, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.801

and brought them out TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.802

and sayde: Syrs, what must I do to be saved?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.803

And they sayde: beleve on the Lorde Jesus and thou shalt be saved and
thy housholde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.804

And they preached unto him the worde of the Lorde, and to all that were
in his housse.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.805

And he toke them the same houre of the nyght TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.806

and wasshed their woundes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.807

and was baptised with all that belonged vnto him strayght waye.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.808

When he had brought them into his housse, he set meate before them,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.809

and ioyed that he with all his housholde, $beleved {TEXT:boleved} on God.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.810

And when it was daye, the officers sent the ministres sayinge: Let those
men goo.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.811

The keper of the preson tolde this sayinge to Paul, the officiers have
sent worde to lowse you.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.812

Now therfore get you hence TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.813

and goo in peace.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.814

Then sayde Paul vnto them: they have beaten vs openly vncomdempned,
for all that we are Romayns, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.815

and have cast vs into preson: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.816

and now wolde they sende vs awaye prevely?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.817

Naye not so, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.818

but let them come them selves and fet vs out.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.819

When the ministres tolde these wordes vnto the officers, they feared
when they hearde that they were Romayns, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.820

and came TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.821

and besought them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.822

and brought them out, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.823

and desyred them to departe out of the cite.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,20A.824

<P_16,40A>

And they went out of the preson TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,40A.826

and entred into the housse of Lidia, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,40A.827

and when they had sene the brethren, they comforted them
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,40A.828

and departed.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,16,40A.829

The.xvii.  Chapter.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.832

<$$heading>

As they made their iorney thorow Amphipolis, and Appolonia, they came to
Thessalonica where was a synagoge of the Iewes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.834

And Paul as his maner was, went in vnto them, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.835

and thre saboth dayes declared oute of the scripture vnto them, openynge
and allegynge that Christ must nedes have suffred and rysen agayne from
deeth, and that this Iesus was Christ, whom <paren> sayde he <$$paren>
I preache to you.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.836

And some of them beleved and came and companyed with Paul and Sylas:
also of the honourable Grekes a greate multitude, and of the chefe wemen,
not a feawe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.837

But the Iewes which beleved not, havynge indignacion, toke vnto them
evyll men which were vagabondes, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.838

and gadered a company, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.839

and set all the cite on a roore, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.840

and made asaute vnto the housse of Iason, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.841

and sought to bringe them out to the people.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.842

But when they founde them not, they drue Iason and certayne brethren vnto
the heedes of the cite cryinge: these that trouble the worlde, are come
hydder also, which Iason hath receaved prevely.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.843

And these all do contrary to the elders of Cesar, affirmynge another
kynge, one Iesus.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.844

And they troubled the people and the officers of the cite when they
hearde these thinges.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.845

And when they were sufficiently answered of Iason, and of the other,
they let them goo.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.846

And the brethren immediatly sent awaye Paul and Sylas by nyght vnto
Berrea.  Which when they were come thyther, they entred into the synagoge
of the Iewes.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.847

These were the noblest of byrthe amonge them of Thessalonia which receaved
the worde with all diligence of mynde, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.848

and searched the scriptures dayly whether those thinges were even so.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.849

And many of them beleved: also of worshipfull wemen which were Grekes,
and of men not afeawe.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.850

When the Jewes, of Thessalonia had knowledge that the worde of God was
preached of Paul at Berrea, they came there TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.851

and moved the people.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.852

And then by and by the brethren sent awaye Paul to goo as it were to
the see: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.853

but Sylas and Timotheus abode there still.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.854

And they that gyded Paul, brought him vnto Attens, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.855

and receaved a commaundment vnto Sylas and Timotheus for to come to him
atonce, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.856

and came their waye.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.857

Whyll Paul wayted for them at Attens, his sprete was moved in him,
to se the cite geven to worshippinge of ymages.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.858

Then he disputed in the synagoge with the Iewes, and with the devout
persones, and in the market dayly with them that came vnto him.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.859

Certayne philosophers of the Epicures and of the stoyckes, disputed
with him.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.860

And some ther were which sayde: what will this babler saye.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.861

Other sayd: he semeth to be a tydynges bringer of newe devyls , because
he preached vnto them Iesus and the resurreccion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.862

And they toke him, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.863

and brought him into Marsestrete sayinge: maye we not knowe what this
newe doctrine wher of thou speakest, is?  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,1A.864

<P_17,20A>

For thou bringest straunge tydynges to oure eares.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.866

We wolde knowe therfore what these thinges meane.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.867

For all the Attenians and straungers which were there, gave them
selves to nothinge els, but ether to tell or to heare newe tydynges.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.868

Paul stode in the myddes of Marse strete TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.869

and sayde: ye men of Attens, I perceave that in all thinges ye are to
supersticious.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.870

For as I passed by and behelde the maner how ye worship youre goddes ,
I founde an aultre wher in was written: vnto the vnknowen god.  Whom ye
then ignorantly worship, TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.871

him shewe I vnto you.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.872

God that made the worlde and all that are in it, seynge that he is
Lorde of heven and erth, he dwelleth not in temples made with hondes,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.873

nether is worshipped with mennes hondes, as though he neded of eny
thinge, seinge he him selfe geveth lyfe and breeth to all men every
where, and hath made of one bloud all nacions of men, for to dwell on
all the face of the erthe, and hath assigned, before how longe tyme, and
also the endes of their inhabitacion, that they shuld seke God, yf they
myght fele and fynde him, though he be not farre from every one of vs.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.874

For in him we lyve, move and have oure beynge, as certayne of youre awne
Poetes sayde.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.875

For we are also his generacion.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.876

For as moche then as we are the generacion of God, we ought not to thynke
that the godhed is lyke vnto golde, silver or stone, graven by crafte
and ymaginacion of man.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.877

And the tyme of this ignoraunce God regarded not: TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.878

but now he byddeth all men every where repent, because he hath apoynted
a daye, in the which he will iudge the worlde acordynge to ryghtewesses,
by that man whom he hath apoynted, and hath offered faith to all men,
after that he had raysed him from deeth.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.879

When they hearde of the resurreccion from deeth, some mocked,
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.880

and other sayde: we will heare the agayne of this matter.
TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.881

So Paul departed from amonge them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.882

Howbeit certayne men clave vnto Paul TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.883

and beleved, amonge the which was Dionysius a senatour, and a woman
named Damaris, and other with them.  TYNDNEW-E1-P2,17,20A.884
