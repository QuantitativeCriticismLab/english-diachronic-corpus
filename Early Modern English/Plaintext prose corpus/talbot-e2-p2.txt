<heading:edcomment:LETTER_CCXXXII_THE_EARL_OF_SHREWSBURY_TO_THE_LORD_BURGHLEY,_WITH_A_CURE_FOR_THE_GOUT>

My especiall good Lord, at this present I have no particuler matter
wherwith to trouble your Lordship, TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,38.3

and yet I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} satisfye myself with silence, but hereby
to recommend myself to your Lordship in all <P_1.3,39> trew affection
of harte, being allway more ready and desirous to express the same by
any other means if it lay in my power.  TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.4

I heard your Lordship was, of late, somewhat visited with the Goute;
TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.5

I hope before this you are well ryd thereof, as I most heartily wish.
TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.6

I would your Lordship woude once make trial of my Oyle of Stags Blud,
TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.7

for I am strongly persuaded of the rare and great vertu thereof.
TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.8

In the beginninge of this Wynter I was touched with the Goute in the
joynte of my great toe, TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.9

and it began somwhat sharpely, TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.10

and yet was I spedely eased, and for that tyme cured by that oyle only.
TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.11

I know it to be a moste safe thynge.  TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.12

Some offence there is in the smell thereof; TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.13

and yet it is wrytten of it that the very smell therof is comfortable
and yeldeth streyngeth to the brayne.  TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.14

I am afrayd to troble your Lordship over longe, TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.15

therfore with the remembrance of my Wyves truble and moste harty
commendacions to your Lordship, and with bothe our prayers for your

take my leave.  TALBOT-E2-P2,1.3,39.16
