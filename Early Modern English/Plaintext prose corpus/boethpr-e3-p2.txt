<font> PROSA <$$font> I.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.3

<$$heading>

By this time she had ended her Song, when I desirous to hear more, was
so charmed by the pleasantness of it, that I stood long expecting that
she would proceed; BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.5

but at last said I, O thou chief Support and Stay of languishing Minds,
how much hast thou refreshed me either with the weight of thy Sentences
or the sweetness of thy Numbers!  so that now I almost think my self an
equal Match for Fortune, and able to resist her Blows.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.6

Therefore I do not only not fear the Application of those Remedies,
which thou didst say a little before were sharp; BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.7

but I earnestly desire to hear what they are.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.8

I well perceived that, returned she, when with silence and attention
thou didst receive my Words; BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.9

and I did then expect such a State of Mind in thee, BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.10

or what is more true, I did then create in thee such an one.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.11

And indeed what yet remains to be said is of such a Nature, that when it
is first tasted, it seems to bite, and is unpleasant; BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.12

but when it is once swallowed it turns sweet, BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.13

and is most grateful to the Stomach.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.14

But because thou sayst thou wouldst now gladly hear, with what Desire
wouldst thou burn, if thou couldst imagine whither I am now about to
lead thee?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,92.15

Whither is that I <P_93> Pray thee?  <paren> said I <$$paren>.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.16

To that true genuine Felicity, answered she, which thy Mind doth
apprehend as if it were in a Dream, and of which thou seemest to have
some Foretaste.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.17

<paren> But thy sight is so clouded with false Forms, and light
Appearances that it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} bear the Lusture of that
Object.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.18

Then I intreat thee without delay, shew me that true Happiness.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.19

I will most willingly, at thy Desire, do it, replied she:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.20

but I will endeavour to describe that false and adulterate Cause which
is better known to thee; BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.21

and that being full laid open, thou wilt be better able to comprehend
that exact Model of true Felicity which I shall draw by casting thine
Eye upon its contrary.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,93.22

<P_94>

<heading>

<font> PR0SA <$$font> II.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,94.25

<$$heading>

Then fixing her Eye a little, and as it were withdrawing her self into
the most inward Cabinet of her Mind, she thus began; BOETHPR-E3-P2,94.27

All the Care and manifold Studies of Men do indeed proceed in differing
Paths BOETHPR-E3-P2,94.28

but they tend to one only End, which is Happiness: BOETHPR-E3-P2,94.29

And Happiness is that compleat Good, of which when a Man is once
possessed, he hath nothing more to desire.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,94.30

This indeed is the Sovereign <P_95> Good of all, BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.31

and contains all others in it: To which, if any thing were wanting it
could not be the chief, because there would be something without it self ,
some foreign Advantage which were to be desired.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.32

It is therefore apparent that Blessedness or Happiness is that
perfect State in which all other Goods meet and centre; which, I have
said, all Men endeavour to arrive at by differing Ways and Means:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.33

For in the Minds of Men there is naturally inserted a Desire of the true
Good BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.34

but wandring Error leads them to the false and fictitious one; so that
some, believing it to be the chief of Goods to want nothing, labour for
an abundance of Riches: BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.35

Others again believing Happiness to consist in being reverenced and
esteemed by their Country-men, endeavour all they can after Honours.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.36

There are also those who place it in Power, BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.37

and these endeavour either to rule themselves, or to be Favourites to
those who actually govern.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.38

There are those also who fancy an high Renown to be the height of
Happiness; BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.39

and these, by all the Arts of War and Peace, hasten to propagate their
Names, and to arrive at Glory.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.40

Many measure the Fruits of this Good by Joy and Chearfulness,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.41

and they think it the happiest thing in the World to abound in Luxury,
and to be dissolved in Pleasures.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,95.42

Some there are who use these Causes and Ends interchangeably; as they
<P_96> who desire Riches as a Means to obtain Power and Pleasures; or as
they who desire Power, either that by it they may get Money or purchase
a Name.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.43

About these and such like things the Intention of all humane Actions
and Desires is versed and employed, as Nobility and popular Applause
are sought after by some, which Men think do make them famous,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.44

and Wives and Children by others are desired for the sake of Pleasure.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.45

Only Friendship, which is a sacred kind of Tie, is not to be
reckoned amongst the Goods of Fortune, but amongst those of Vertue:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.46

but all other things are desired either for the Power or the Pleasure
which they afford.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.47

Now for the Goods of the Body, they are to be referred to the things
mentioned before; BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.48

For Strength, and the large Proportion of Parts, seem to give Power
and Worthiness, Beauty and Swiftness, to afford Glory and Fame;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.49

and Health and Indolence of Body yield Joy and Pleasure.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.50

In all these things it appears that Happiness is only wanting;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.51

for whatever any one desireth above other things, he iudgeth that to be
the chief Good: BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.52

But we have already defined Happiness to be the Soveraign of Goods;
wherefore every one judgeth that to be the happiest State, which he
desires above all others.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,96.53

Thou hast now therefore before thine Eyes an exact Scheme and Form of
humane Felicity, that is, Riches, Honours, <P_97> Powers, Glory and
Pleasure, which last was only considered by Epicure; BOETHPR-E3-P2,97.54

and consequently he did declare that Happiness consisted in that alone,
because he imagined that other things did withdraw Joy and Cheerfulness
from the Heart and Spirits.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,97.55

But I return to the Studies and Inclinations of Men, whose Minds are
always bent upon the chief Good, and are ever seeking after it, though
it seemeth to be as with a darkned Understanding, and like a drunken Man
reeling about, and not knowing which Path to take which may head him home.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,97.56

Do they, let me ask thee, seem to wander who endeavour to put themselves
into a Condition of wanting nothing?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,97.57

Certainly there is no State doth so much afford Happiness as that of
having Plenty and Affluence of all good things, of being out of need
of being beholden to another, but having sufficient for one's self.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,97.58

Or are they guilty of folly who think that what is the best doth deserve
Esteem and Reverence?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,97.59

Certainly <P_98> no; BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.60

for that thing is surely not vile and contemptible, which all Men with
so much Intention labour after.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.61

Is not Power to be numbred amongst Goods?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.62

Why not?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.63

for is that to be esteemed feeble and without Strength, which is
apparently better than all other things?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.64

Is Renown not to be regarded?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.65

but it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be denied, but that whatever is most
excellent seemeth also to be most renowned.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.66

For to what purpose shall we say that Happiness is not an anxious
and melancholy thing, nor subject to Grief and Trouble, since even
in the least things Men seek for what may delight and please them?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.67

These are the things which Men desire to obtain and possess,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.68

and for this Cause do they labour after Riches, Dignities, Commands,
Glory, and Pleasure, that they may have Sufficiences and Abundance
within themselves, that so they may arrive at Esteem, Power and Fame.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.69

It must therefore be a Goal, of which all are in quest by so divers Ways
and different Studies: BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.70

And from hence it may easily appear how great the Power and Force of
Nature is, since notwithstanding that all Men differ very much in their
opinions of Good, yet, they All agree in the choice of the End of it.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,98.71

<P_102>

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> III.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,102.74

<$$heading>

And you, O Men, whose Thoughts are so employed upon things below ;
that I may fitly call you earthly Animals, do think ever of your
Beginning, though it be but with a dreaming and darkned Imagination,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,102.76

and you have always the true end of Happiness in view, although you have
no clear and perfect Notion of it: So that though your natural Intention
leads you to the true Good, yet indirect and manifold Error draws you
from it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,102.77

Consider now if Men can by those Means by which they endeavour to attain
Happiness, arrive at their desired End.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,102.78

For if Riches, if Honours, and other the like Accessions can plant one in
such a State, that he shall seem to want no other thing to make him happy,
then will I confess that Felicity may be derived from such Acquisitions.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,102.79

But if so it be that these $can $not {TEXT:cannot} make good what they
seem so fairly to promise, and that those who possess them in the greatest
measure, do yet want many other Advantages and good things , will not the
counterfeit and mistaken Face of Happiness be clearly discovered in them?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,102.80

First of all therefore I ask thee, who not long since didst abound in
Riches, whether sometimes in that great abundance thy Mind <P_103> was
not anxious and discomposed upon the receiving of any notable Injury?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.81

<font> Boet. <$$font> Truly I never remember that in my most
numerous Prosperity my Spirits were so free as not to be oppressed with
some Trouble or other.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.82

<font> Phil. <$$font> And was not that because something was
absent which thou didst desire, or something present which thou wouldst
have had away?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.83

<font> Boet. <$$font> So it was truly.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.84

<font> Phil. <$$font> Why then thou desiredst the Presence of that,
and the Absence of this.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.85

<font> Boet. <$$font> I confess it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.86

<font> Phil. <$$font> Every Man wanteth, that which he desireth.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.87

<font> Boet. <$$font> Doubtless he doth.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.88

<font> Phil. <$$font> Can that Man then who wanteth any thing be
said to have all things within himself sufficient for his Necessities?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.89

<font> Boet. <$$font> No.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.90

<font> Phil. <$$font> And didst not thou in all thy Plenty labour
under this want?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.91

<font> Boet. <$$font> What then?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.92

<font> Phil. <$$font> Then hence it follows that Riches $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} put a Man beyond all want, nor make him self-sufficient,
although this was it which they seem'd to promise.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.93

And this also I think of great Moment to be considered, that Money hath
nothing in its own Nature which can hinder its being taken from the
Possessor, though against his Will.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.94

<font> Boet. <$$font> I confess that.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.95

<font> Phil. <$$font> It ought to be confess'd, when we see every
Day that the stronger takes it from the weaker.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,103.96

From whence spring all Debates at Law, and all Complaints in Courts of
Judicature, but from this, that Men desire to recover their <P_104>
Estates and Goods, of which they have been bereft either by Force
or Fraud?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.97

<font> Boet. <$$font> It is plain.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.98

<font> Phil. <$$font> Then every Man needeth foreign Helps to
maintain the Possession of his Money.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.99

<font> Boet. <$$font> Who denies it?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.100

<font> Phil. <$$font> But he would not want such Help unless
he were the Owner of Money, which he is in a possibility of losing.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.101

<font> Boet. <$$font> That is unquestionable.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.102

<font> Phil. <$$font> Then is the thing turned into its contrary
; BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.103

for Riches, which were thought to have made a Man self-sufficient,
do rather make him have need of Aid from others.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.104

By what way do Riches drive away Necessity?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.105

Can rich Men be neither hungry nor thirsty?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.106

Are not the Bodies of the Rich sensible of Winter's Cold?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.107

But perhaps thou mayst say, such Men have wherewith to satisfy this,
and to quench that, and to keep out the other.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.108

By these Means $it $'s {TEXT:it's} true that Riches may comfort and
support those who suffer these things, BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.109

but they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} wholly free them from such Inconveniences
.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.110

But if these Necessities, which are ever gaping and asking for more ,
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be supplied with Wealth, then there still remains
something which should be satisfied.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.111

I shall not now urge that the smallest things are sufficient for Nature,
and that nothing is enough for Avarice.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.112

But if Riches $can $not {TEXT:cannot} remove Want, but rather create it,
why should Men vainly imagine that they can meet and supply all humane
Necessities?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,104.113

<P_105>

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> IV.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,105.116

<$$heading>

But it may be said that Dignities render those Men honoured and esteem'd
who possess them.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,105.118

I shall only then ask, if they have the Power to place Vertue in the Minds
of those who enjoy them, and clear them from Vice?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,105.119

Surely no, BOETHPR-E3-P2,105.120

for it hath been found by experience, that they are so far from expelling
vitious Habits, <P_106> that they rather make them more conspicuous.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,106.121

Hence it is that we often so much disdain their being conferr'd upon
undeserving Men.  For which Reason, <font> Catullus <$$font> called <font>
Nonius <$$font> the Consul, even when he was <P_107> sitting in his
Ivory Chair, the Botch or Impostume of the State.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.122

Dost thou not see what great Inconveniences Dignities have wrought to
wicked Men?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.123

Their Deformities would less appear if they were more obscure, and could
be content to be without honourable Titles.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.124

And let me now ask thee, if thou thy self <paren> notwithstanding
the Danger's which hang over thee <$$paren> couldst condescend to be
Colleague with <font> Decoratus <$$font> in the Magistracy, who hath
discovered himself to be a saucy Buffoon and an officious Informer?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.125

For it is not reasonable to reverence those Men who have arrived at
Honours without deserving them: BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.126

but if thou seest a Man endowed with Wisdom, thou couldst not but think
him worthy of Reverence and Esteem, and of the Wisdom with which he
is endowed.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.127

<font> Boet. <$$font> No surely, BOETHPR-E3-P2,107.128

for Vertue hath her proper Worth, which she <P_108> transfers to those
who are her Votaries.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.129

And forasmuch as Honours conferr'd by the People $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
make a Man worthy of them, it is clear that they do not contain the
genuine Beauty of true Worth and Dignity: BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.130

In this Men also ought to be wary; BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.131

for if a Man be so much the more abject, by how much the more he is
despised of everyone; then Dignities which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
procure Reverence or Esteem to ill Men, whom they expose to the World
, do necessarily make them more the Subjects of Contempt and Scorn.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.132

Nor do Dignities themselves come off clear; BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.133

for impious Persons are reveng'd on them, since they sully and stain the
Brightness of them by their contagious Villanies.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.134

And that thou mayst know that Esteem and Reverence $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be purchased by these transitory and empty Dignities, consider, that if
a Man who hath often been Consul, and run through many other honourable
Degrees of Magistracy, should perchance arrive in a barbarous Nation,
would his Honours, dost thou think, make him be reverenced by those
Barbarians?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.135

Further, if it were of the Nature of Dignities to make Men venerable
and reverenc'd, it would perform that Office in all Places, amongst all
Nations, and at all times; as Fire, where-ever it is, never parts with
its innate Quality of being hot.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,108.136

But because Honours do not proceed from any Power in themselves, but arise
from the false <P_109> Opinion of Men, they immediately vanish , when
they chance to be amongst those who do not esteem them to be Dignities.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,109.137

But this is amongst foreign Nations.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,109.138

Let me then ask thee, if they always endure even with those from whom
they have their Beginnings?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,109.139

The Pretorship heretofore was a great and honourable Employ, and much
sought after, BOETHPR-E3-P2,109.140

but now it is only an empty Name, and an heavy Addition to the Senator's
Expence, BOETHPR-E3-P2,109.141

whoever heretofore had the Superintendency of the Markets, and was to
provide Corn for the People, and had the Care the of the publick Victuals,
and was esteemed great and honourable; but now what is there more vile
and abject than that Employ?  So that what I said a little before is
very clear, that the thing which hath no proper innate Beauty, must
necessarily sometimes be <P_110> splendid and admired, and sometimes
undervalued and slighted, as the Opinion of the People flows or ebbs.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,110.142

If Dignities therefore $can $not {TEXT:cannot} give Men Reverence and
Esteem, if they become vile by the Contagion of ill Men, if they lost
their Lustre by the Change of times, if they are esteemed worthy, or
otherwise according to the Estimation of Men, what Beauty then is there
in them which should make them desirable, BOETHPR-E3-P2,110.143

or what Dignity can they confer on others?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,110.144

<P_111>

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> V.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.147

<$$heading>

<font> Phil. <$$font> Can Kingdoms or the Familiarity of Princes
make a man mighty?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.149

<font> Boet. <$$font> How can it be otherwise, since their Felicity
doth always endure?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.150

<font> Ph. <$$font> But mistake not, BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.151

for both Antiquity and the present Times abound with Examples of Kings
and Potentates who have been forced to change an happy for a calamitous
Estate.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.152

And then we may justly cry out, how great and glorious a thing is Power,
which is not of Ability to preserve even it self?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.153

But if Dominion and the Rule over many People be the efficient Cause
of Happiness, doth not it follow, that if it be defective in any Part
, it must necessarily diminish that Happiness and introduce Misery?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.154

But although humane Empires extend themselves far and wide, there must
of necessity be many People over which every King can have no Command;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.155

and on whatsoever Hand this Power which constitutes Happiness shall fail,
there must Impotence enter, which causes Misery.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,111.156

Hence therefore it is natural to aver, that Princes must have a larger
<P_112> Portion of Misery than of its contrary.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,112.157

A certain Tyrant who well understood the danger of his Condition, did
well express the Fears and Cares which attend Government by the Terror
of a naked Sword hanging over a Man's Head.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,112.158

What then is this thing call'd Power, which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
expel Care, nor banish Fear?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,112.159

Men desire to live secure, BOETHPR-E3-P2,112.160

but $can $not {TEXT:cannot}; BOETHPR-E3-P2,112.161

and yet they glory in and boast of their Power.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,112.162

Canst thou believe him to be powerful, whom thou seest not able to
do what he would?  or him mighty, who goes surrounded with a Guard,
to terrify those of whom he himself is <P_113> more afraid, and whose
Power is seated in the Number of his Attendance?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,113.163

And now why should I trouble my self to discourse of the Favourites of
Princes, when I have shew'd even Kingdoms themselves to be subject to so
much Imbecility?  especially since these gaudy things are often disgraced
and ruined, as well when the Prince is fortunate as when he is unhappy.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,113.164

<font> Nero <$$font> would allow <font> Seneca <$$font> his Friend and
Tutor this only Favour, to chuse the manner of his Death after he had
condemned him.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,113.165

The Emperor <font> Antoninus <$$font> <P_114> exposed <font> Papinian
<$$font>, who had long been great at Court, to fall by the Swords of
his Souldiers.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.166

Both of them would willingly have renounced their Authority;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.167

and <font> Seneca <$$font> was willing to have given his whole Estate,
and all his Riches into the Hands of <font> Nero <$$font>, and to have
retired: BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.168

but whilst the Force of Fate pushed them on towards their Fall,
neither of them could accomplish what they desired to have done.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.169

What then is this Power, of which Men even when they enjoy it, are afraid?
of which, when they are desirous, they are not sure nor safe?  and which,
when they would lay it down, they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be acquitted
of it?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.170

Are those Friends to be trusted to in time of need, whose Friendship is
not founded upon Vertue, but upon thy Fortune?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.171

Believe it, they whom thy happy Estate have made so, will change when
that is altered; BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.172

and when thou art miserable, they will be thy Enemies.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,114.173

nothing, whose Lives nevertheless thou hast rendred famous!  <$$font>
BOETHPR-E3-P2,116.180

for many have surrepitiously gotten to themselves great Names by the
false and mistaken Opinions of the Vulgar, than which nothing can be

For they who are praised and applauded undeservingly, must needs, if
they have any Modesty, be ashamed and blush at the Recital of their
own Praises.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,116.182

But if Esteem and Praise be purchased by Defect, what Satisfaction
yet can they add to the Mind of a wise Man, who measures not his Good
by popular Rumour, but by the just Rules of Truth and Conscience?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,116.183

And if it seem a fair and noble thing for a Man to have made himself
famous, and to have propagated his Name, then by Consequence it must be
adjudged the contrary, not to have done so.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,116.184

But since, as I have before demonstrated, there must be many People
in the Earth whom the Renown of one Man could never reach, then of
<P_117> necessity must follow, that he whom thou accountest glorious
must to the greatest part of the World be inglorious and obscure.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,117.185

Amongst these things I do not think popular Favour to be worthy to be
taken notice of, which is neither the Product of Judgment, nor ever was
or can be of Duration.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,117.186

And now who doth not see how vain, how empty, and how uncertain Titles
of Nobility are?  which if referred to Renown, they are wholly foreign
to it: BOETHPR-E3-P2,117.187

For Nobility seems to be that fame and Praise which proceedeth from the
Merits of Ancestors.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,117.188

Now if Praise can give Nobility, they necessarily are noble who are
praised.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,117.189

Then it follows thou canst derive no Splendor from the Nobility of
another, if thou hast none of thine own.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,117.190

But if there be any Good and Advantage in Nobility, I think it is
only this, that it serves to impose a kind of Necessity upon those
who possess it, of not degenerating the Vertue of their Progenitors.

<font> PROSA <$$font> VII.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,118.194

<$$heading>

Why should I here discourse of the Pleasures of the Body, the Desire
of which is full of Anxiety, and the satisfying of them, of Repentance?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,118.196

What dangerous Diseases, what intolerable Pains, being like Fruits
of Iniquity, do they bring to the Bodies of those who enjoy them?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,118.197

and what Joys are to be found in the Motions of them, I confess I
know not.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,118.198

But this I know, that whoever will call to mind his Luxury and Lusts,
shall find much bitterness in the Issue of them.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,118.199

If these things can make Men happy, I see no Cause why Beasts also may
<P_119> not be said to be in a possibility of obtaining Happiness, since
by their Instinct they are urged to intend and pursue bodily Delight.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,119.200

The Satisfaction of having a Wife and Children were great,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,119.201

but it hath been said, though against Nature, that some in their Children
have found Tormentors: BOETHPR-E3-P2,119.202

How biting and uneasy the Condition of such is, it is not necessary to
tell thee, who hath before this tried it, and who are not under so great
a Discomposure.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,119.203

In this I approve the Opinion of <font> Euripides <$$font>, who said, that
he who hath no Children is happy in his Misfortune.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,119.204

<P_120>

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> VIII.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.207

<$$heading>

From what I have said then it may without doubt appear, that all these
mentioned Ways are wrong and deceitful, and $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
lead Men to that Happiness which they promise: BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.209

And with how many Evils and Inconveniences they are perplexed, I shall
soon shew thee.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.210

Consider then thus: BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.211

Hast thou a mind to amass Wealth?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.212

then thou must bereave the Possessor of it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.213

Wouldst thou shine in Dignities and Titles?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.214

thou must supplicate him who is the Fountain of them, and who only can
confer them; BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.215

and so thou who desirest to outgo others in Honour, shall by meanly
asking it become contemptible.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.216

Dost thou affect Power?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.217

thou wilt expose thy self to Danger, by subjecting thy self to the Traps
and Snares of those who are under thee.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.218

Art thou desirous of Glory?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.219

being distracted by sharp and severe Dispensations, thou shalt forgo
thy Security and Quiet.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.220

Wouldst thou lead a voluptuous life?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.221

think then that all Men will scorn and contemn him who is a Slave to
that vile and frail thing, his Body.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.222

And now upon how weak a Foundation do they build, upon how uncertain
a Possession do they rely, who value and affect corporal Delights?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,120.223

Canst thou surpass the Elephant <P_121> in Bulk, or the Oxe in Strength?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.224

Canst thou excel the Tigers in Swiftness?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.225

Behold the vast Space and Extention of the Heavens, their Firmness,
and the Swiftness of their Motions, BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.226

and then at length cease to admire vile or less things.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.227

Nor is the Heaven more to be admired for these Qualities mentioned,
than for those exact orders and Methods by which it is governed.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.228

How fleeting, and of how short Duration is Beauty and Exactness of
Feature, BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.229

how swiftly it passeth, fading sooner than a vernal Flower!
BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.230

For as <font> Aristotle <$$font> saith, if a Man had the Eyes of a <font>
Lynx <$$font>, that so he might pierce through every Medium which should
oppose him, would not he, if he looked into the inward Recesses of the
Body of <font> Alcibiades <$$font>, whose outward Form was so fair and
charming, find it noisom and foul?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,121.231

And therefore thy Nature doth not make thee appear beautiful, <P_122>
but the Infirmity of the Eyes of thy Beholders.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,122.232

Esteem bodily Goods as much as thou wilt, BOETHPR-E3-P2,122.233

but consider, that what thou so much admirest may in three Days be
shaken and dissolved by the raging Fires of a Fever.  From all which
we may gather this, that those things which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
confer those Goods which they promise, nor are perfect and consummate by
a general Meeting of all Goods in themselves, can neither always conduct
to Happiness, nor by themselves make any one happy.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,122.234

<font> PROSA <$$font> XII.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.238

<$$heading>

<font> Boet. <$$font> I now very much assent to <font> Plato
<$$font>, since this second time thou hast brought these things to
my remembrance.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.240

At first when my Memory was drowned by the Conjunction of my Body with
my Soul, BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.241

and then when I afterwards lost it in those Pressures of Sorrow under
which I laboured.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.242

<font> Ph. <$$font> If thou wilt a little recollect what thou hast
granted above, thou wilt not be far from remembring that thing of which
a little before thou didst confess thy Ignorance.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.243

<font> Bo. <$$font> What thing was that?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.244

<font> Ph. <$$font> It was, by what Power the Universe is governed.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,148.245

<font> Bo. <$$font> I confess I did in that <P_149> own my want
of Knowledg; BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.246

but although I have a Prospect of what thou wilt infer, yet I desire to
hear it made more plain from thy Mouth.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.247

<font> Ph. <$$font> A little time before thou didst think that
there was no Reason to doubt but that this World was governed by God.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.248

<font> Bo. <$$font> Nor do I think otherwise now,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.249

nor shall I ever think that it ought to be doubted; BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.250

and I will briefly recount to you the Reasons which lead me to this
Opinion.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.251

The differing and contrariant Parts of which this World is compos'd,
had never been brought together into one beautiful Form, without the
Assistanoe of a powerful Hand to join them: BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.252

And even after such a Conjunction the disagreeing Qualities of their
Natures had dissociated the Parts, and ruined the Fabrick, if the same
conjoining Hand had not kept them together: BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.253

For the Order and Methods of Nature could not so certainly proceed,
nor produce so regular Motions, disposed and limited according to Times,
Places, Actings, Spaces, and Qualities, unless there were one remaining,
fix'd and immovable Being to mesnage so great Varieties of Change.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.254

I give this excellent Being, whatever it is, by which all things created
endure, and are actuated and informed, the known Denomination of God.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,149.255

<font> Ph. <$$font> Seeing that thou hast so right a Sentiment of
these things, there is but little more to be done now that thou mayst
once more be happy <P_150> and safe, and that thou mayst revisit thy
own Countrey: BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.256

But let us reflect a little upon what we have before proposed.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.257

Have not we agreed that Sufficiency is of the Nature of true Happiness?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.258

And have we not granted that God is that true Happiness?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.259

<font> Bo. <$$font> We have.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.260

<font> Ph. <$$font> And that towards the Government of this World
he shall need no Helps or foreign Instruments?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.261

for if he should, he should not then be self-sufficient.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.262

<font> Bo. <$$font> That necessarily follows.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.263

<font> Ph. <$$font> Therefore by himself alone he disposeth of
all things.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.264

<font> Bo. <$$font> It $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be denied.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.265

<font> Ph. <$$font> And I have shewed that God is the real Good.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.266

<font> Bo. <$$font> I remember it well.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.267

<font> Ph. <$$font> By that Good then doth he order every thing,
because he governs all things by himself, whom we have granted to be
the Sovereign Good; BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.268

and he is that great and certain Rule and Method of Government which keeps
the Machine of the World together, giving it Stability, and preserving
it from Corruption.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.269

<font> Bo. <$$font> I entirely agree to this, BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.270

and I did foresee before that this was it which thou wert about to say.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.271

<font> Ph. <$$font> I believe it; BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.272

and now I believe thy Eyes are more intent upon these great Truths.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.273

But what I shall say is not less open to thy View.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.274

<font> Bo. <$$font> What is that.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.275

<font> Ph. <$$font> God is rightly believed to govern all things
by his Goodness, and all those things, as I have before taught, to hasten
by a natural Bent and Intention towards Good, BOETHPR-E3-P2,150.276

can it be doubted but <P_151> that they voluntarily submit to his
Government, and that of their own Accord they willingly comply with,
and yield up themselves to him their Ruler?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.277

<font> Bo. <$$font> That must necessarily be, BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.278

otherwise the Government could not subsist: BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.279

if People were suffered to draw different ways, there would be no Safety
for those who obey.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.280

<font> Ph. <$$font> Is there any Being then, which follows the
Dictates of Nature, that endeavours to go contrary to the laws of God?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.281

<font> Bo. <$$font> No surely.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.282

<font> Ph. <$$font> But if there should be so prepostrous an one,
shall it ever be able to prevail against him, whom by the Right of true
Happiness we have granted to be most powerful?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.283

<font> Bo. <$$font> If there were such an one, certainly it could
never prevail.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.284

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then there is nothing that either will or
can resist this Sovereign Good which ruleth all things powerfully,
and disposeth them softly and harmoniously.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.285

<font> Bo. <$$font> How am I delighted not only with this Sum
and Conclusion of thy Reasons and Arguments, but much more also with
thy very Words!  so that at length those wicked People who impiously
have reprehended the Government of God, may blush and be ashamed of
their Folly.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.286

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou hast read, amongst the Mythologists,
the Story of the Giants who stormed Heaven; BOETHPR-E3-P2,151.287

but the Divine Arms, according to their Demerits, repell'd and punished
<P_152> them: BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.288

But wilt thou now that we commit and compare our Reasons together?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.289

Perhaps by so doing some clear Spark of Truth may break out.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.290

<font> Bo. <$$font> Do as it pleaseth thee.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.291

<font> Ph. <$$font> No Body then will doubt but that God is
Omnipotent.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.292

<font> Bo. <$$font> No Man in his Senses doubteth of that.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.293

<font> Ph. <$$font> And that there is nothing which he who is
Almighty $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.294

<font> Bo. <$$font> Nothing surely.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.295

<font> Ph. <$$font> Can God then do Evil?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.296

<font> Bo. <$$font> No.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.297

<font> Ph. <$$font> Is Evil nothing?  since he $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} do it who can do all things.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.298

<font> Bo. <$$font> Dost thou play with me, leading me by thy
Reasons into an inextricable Labyrinth, which sometimes thou entrest
where thou goest out, and sometimes thou goest out where thou entrest?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.299

Dost thou endeavour then to amuse me by thy intricate Reasonings
, enclosing me in a wonderful Circle of Divine Simplicity?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.300

For a little before, beginning at Happiness, thou didst declare it to be
the Sovereign Good, and that it did reside in God; then that God himself
was that Good, and the Fulness of Happiness: BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.301

And hence thou didst infer, and give to me as a Mark of thy Bounty,
that no Body could be happy, unless he were God.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.302

Again thou saidst that the very Form of Good was the Substance of Good
and Happiness; BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.303

and didst teach, that that was the only genuine Good which was desired
by all things in Nature.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,152.304

Thus further didst argue and demonstrate, that God by his <P_153>
Goodness did govern the World, and that all things willingly obeyed him ,
and that Evil had not any Nature and Existence which might be properly
so called: BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.305

and these things thou didst explain by no strained or far-fetch'd
Reasons , but by strong and natural Truths, one thing still confirming
and verifying another.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.306

<font> Ph. <$$font> I have not deluded thee, BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.307

for by the Assistance of God, for which we lately prayed, we have run
through our chief Work: BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.308

For such is the Nature and Form of the Divine Substance, that it neither
communicates it self to foreign things, nor receives such into its own
Nature; BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.309

but, as <font> Parmenides <$$font> saith of it, {COM:greek_omitted}
God is like to a sphere which is every way round.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.310

He rolleth the moving Globe of the world, whilst he himself remains
immobile: BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.311

And if I have not drawn my Reasons from things without, but those within
the Comopass of my Subject, wonder not at it; BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.312

for as <font> Plato <$$font> before hath taught us, there ought to be a
Consonancy and Alliance betwixt the Word and the Matter which we handle.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,153.313

<P_159>

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> I.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.316

<$$heading>

When Philosophy, preserving the Dignity and the Gravity of her
Countenance, had in soft and sweet Strains sung these things, I not
having wholly forgot my Grief, and the distemper of my Mind remaining,
did thus interrupt her, being now ready to have continued her Discourse.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.318

Those things, O thou Fore-runner and giver of the true Light!  which thou
hast hitherto delivered, are evidently clear and unanswerable, as well
from that divine Testimony which they bear about them, as from thy
irrefragable Reasons: BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.319

and although I had forgotten them, through the Prevalency of Grief for
the many Injuries which I have endured, yet, as thou hast said, I was
not wholly ignorant of them: BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.320

But this one thing, I must own, is the greatest Cause of my Sorrow, to
wit, that whilst there is one good Ruler of all things, there should
be any Evil at all, or at the least, that it should pass unpunished.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.321

And how worthy this is of Admiration thou mayst consider.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.322

To this also another greater Mischief is adjoined: BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.323

For while Impiety doth bear Command and flourish, Vertue doth not only
want its Reward, BOETHPR-E3-P2,159.324

but is also trampled upon by wicked <P_160> Men, BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.325

and bears the Punishment due to its Enemy.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.326

No Man therefore can enough wonder and complain that Affairs should
move so under the Governance of a God all-knowing, almighty, and willing
nothing but what is the best.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.327

And it would indeed, returned she, be a thing not only of infinite Wonder,
but also horribly monstrous, if in the well-regulated Family of so great
a Master, the worthless Vessels, as thou imaginest, should be honoured,
and the more pretious ones be despised: BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.328

But thou art mistaken, BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.329

it is not truly so: BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.330

For if these Conclusions which I have drawn be a little reserved entire
, thou shalt well know by the Authority of God, of whose Reign and
Government I now speak, that the Good are always powerful and mighty,
the evil Men ever Cast-aways and weak; that Vice never passeth without
its Punishment, nor Vertue without its Rewards; that Happiness always
attends good Men, and Misfortunes the wicked.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.331

These and many other things of this kind shall be proved to thee, which
may put an end to thy complaints, and strengthen thee with all Firmness
and Solidity.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,160.332

and because I have lately shewn to thee, with a full Pace, the Figure
of true Happiness, and also in what it is placed, and all things being
run through which I think necessary to be premised, I shall now chalk
out to thee that direct way which will <P_161> lead thee again to thy
own Habitation.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,161.333

I will also affix Wings to thy Mind, by which it may raise it self on
high, that so all Trouble being done away, and all Obstacles remov'd,
thou mayst by my Direction, by my Way, by my Conveniences of travelling ,
return safe into thy own Country.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,161.334

<font> PROSA <$$font> II.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.337

<$$heading>

<font> Boet. <$$font> O Wonderful!  BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.339

thou promisest great things indeed!  BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.340

nor do I doubt but thou canst perform them: BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.341

therefore I intreat thee, without delay, to satisfy my Expectation.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.342

<font> Ph. <$$font> First then thou shalt know that vertuous Men
are always armed with Power, and that the wicked are always destitute
of Strength; BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.343

and these Assertions do mutually demonstrate each other:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.344

For since Good and Evil are contrary, if Good be powerful, Evil must be
weak and frail; BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.345

and if thou knowest the Frailness of Evil, the Firmness of Good must
also be known to thee.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.346

But that the Credit and Truth of my Opinion may appear more abundantly,
I will proceed in both ways, confirming what is proposed now on this,
now on that part.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.347

There are two Poles upon which all humane Actions do turn, that is to say,
the Will and Power; BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.348

if either of these be absent, nothing can be done: BOETHPR-E3-P2,163.349

For the Will being wanting, <P_164> no Man attempts to do that which he
will not do; BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.350

and if Power faileth, the Will is of no Effect.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.351

Hence it is, that if thou seest any Man desirous to obtain that which
he doth not compass, thou needst not doubt but he wanted the Power of
obtaining that which he would have.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.352

<font> Bo. <$$font> $That $'s {TEXT:That's} clear,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.353

nor can it be denied.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.354

<font> Ph. <$$font> Whom then thou seest do that which he
had a mind to do, canst thou doubt that he had a Power to do it?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.355

<font> Bo. <$$font> No surely.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.356

<font> Ph. <$$font> And in that a Man is able to do a thing,
Men esteem him mighty; BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.357

and in that he is not able {in}, he is looked upon as weak.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.358

<font> Bo. <$$font> I confess it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.359

<font> Ph. <$$font> Dost thou remember then that it was
collected from former Reasons; that every Intention of Man's Will,
however actuated by different Studies, doth hasten towards Happiness?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.360

<font> Bo. <$$font> I remember well that that was demonstrated.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.361

<font> Ph. <$$font> Canst thou call to mind that it hath been
shewed, that Happiness is the Sovereign Good, and that when Happiness
is sought for, Good is desired of all?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.362

<font> Bo. <$$font> I need not call it to mind, because it is
always fixed in my Memory.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.363

<font> Ph. <$$font> All Men then, the good as well as the
bad, with one and the same Intention, endeavour to arrive at Good.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.364

<font> Bo. <$$font> It naturally follows.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.365

<font> Ph. <$$font> And it is certain when Men have obtained Good,
they are made good.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.366

<font> Bo. <$$font> It is most certain.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.367

<font> Ph. <$$font> Do good Men obtain then what they desire?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.368

<font> Bo. <$$font> It seems so.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,164.369

<font> Ph. <$$font> But if evil Men obtain <P_165> the Good which
they desire, they may not still be evil?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.370

<font> Bo. <$$font> So it is.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.371

<font> Ph. <$$font> Since therefore then both Parties are in quest
of Good, but these only obtain it and the other lose it, it is not at
all to be doubted but that good Men are powerful, and the wicked weak
and feeble.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.372

<font> Bo. <$$font> Whoever doubts of this, does neither rightly
consider the Nature of things, nor understand the Consequences of
Reasoning.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.373

<font> Ph. <$$font> Again, if there be two, who, according
to Nature, propose to themselves the same thing, and one of them
acts naturally, and performs his Intention, but the other $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} administer the natural Office, but imitates him by another
Method than what is agreeable to Nature, who did accomplish his Purpose,
yet this Man doth not attain his End; which of these dost thou judg to
be most powerful?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.374

<font> Bo. <$$font> Although I guess at what thou sayst, yet I
desire thou wouldst further explain thy self.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.375

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou wilt not deny but the Motion of Walking
is natural to Men?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.376

<font> Bo. <$$font> No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.377

<font> Ph. <$$font> And thou doubtest not, but to perform this
Motion is the natural Office of the Feet?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.378

<font> Bo. <$$font> Nor will I deny it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.379

<font> Ph. <$$font> If then he who is able to use his Feet walks
, and if another to whom this natural Office of the Feet is wanting,
creeping upon his Hands, doth endeavour to walk, which of these, by right,
ought to be esteemed more able?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.380

<font> Bo. <$$font> Proceed with what remains;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,165.381

for no <P_166> one doubteth but he who is able to move naturally
upon his Feet, is more powerful than he who $can $not {TEXT:cannot}.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.382

<font> Ph. <$$font> But the Sovereign Good, which even the Vertuous
and Impious propose to themselves as their End, by the one Party is
sought by the natural means of Vertue, whilst the other endeavours after
it by various and differing Desires of earthly things, which is not the
natural way of obtaining it; BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.383

dost thou think otherwise?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.384

<font> Bo. <$$font> No; BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.385

for the Consequence is plain, BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.386

and it appears out of that which before I granted, which was, that
the Good were endowed with Power and Might, and that the evil Men were
destitute of it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.387

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou dost rightly run before me;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.388

and it is a good Sign, as Physicians observe, when Nature exerts her self,
and resists the Malady.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.389

But because I perceive thou art quick of Apprehension, and ready to
understand, I shall continue to thee my Reasons: BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.390

Behold then how plainly the Infirmity and Weakness of vitious Men lies
open, who $can $not {TEXT:cannot} even attain to that to which their
natural Intention leads them, and which it almost compels them to seek.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.391

And what does thou think would become of these Men, if they were deserted
by this almost unconquerable Bent and Help of Nature, which always goes
before them?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.392

Consider with thy self how great the Impotence of wicked Men is:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,166.393

Nor are they slight and empty things to which they <P_167> aspire,
and which they have not Power to obtain.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.394

But they attempt the chief and highest of all things,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.395

and there they fail; BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.396

nor can bring that to effect after which they by Day and Night endeavour
; and in the obtaining of which the Might of the Vertuous is eminent.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.397

For as thou mayst deem him a good Walker, who hath been able to go so far
on his Feet, that no way doth lie beyond the Place at which he is arrived
; so must thou necessarily judg him to be most mighty, who hath attained
that thing beyond which nothing is to be desired.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.398

True then it is, that wicked Men are wholly destitute of those Powers
which the Good amply possess: BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.399

For why do they leave Vertue and pursue Vice?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.400

Is it because they know not Good?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.401

But what is more weak and base than the Blindness of Ignorance?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.402

or are they perhaps acquainted with the way which they ought to follow?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.403

But Lust, or some inordinate Desires do lead them aside;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.404

so doth also Intemperance to weak Natures, which $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
resist Vice.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.405

But do they knowingly and willingly desert Good, and turn to Evil?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.406

But this way they do not only cease to be mighty, but also even to be.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,167.407

For those who neglect the common End of all Beings, do also leave off
to be.  Which thing perhaps to some may seem wonderful, that the Vitious ,
who make up the most numerous Part of Mankind, should not <P_168> be Men,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.408

but it is most truly so.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.409

And thus it is.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.410

I do not deny but that the Wicked are wicked; BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.411

but that they have any Being, purely and simply, I deny:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.412

For as thou mayst call a Carcase a dead Man, but simply thou canst
not call it a Man; so will I grant that the Vitious are vitious Men,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.413

but absolutely that they exist I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} confess.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.414

That thing is or hath a Being which observeth its Order, and retains
its Nature; BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.415

but that which faileth in this, deserteth its natural Being.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.416

But thou mayst say, that even the Wicked have a Power to act:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.417

Nor will I deny it; BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.418

but this their Power is not derived from Strength but Weakness.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.419

They can do Evil, $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} true, BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.420

but they could not do that if they persevered in doing Good; which
Possibility doth clearly demonstrate that they can do nothing:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.421

For if, as we have before gathered, Evil be nothing, it is clear
that whilst flagitious Men can only do ill, they can do nothing.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.422

And that thou mayst understand what is the Bent and Force of this
Power, we have before determined that nothing is more powerful than the
Sovereign Good.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.423

<font> Bo. <$$font> $That $'s {TEXT:That's} true.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.424

<font> Ph. <$$font> And that Sovereign Good can do no ill.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.425

<font> Bo. <$$font> It can do none.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.426

<font> Ph. <$$font> Is there then any one who thinks that Men
can do all things?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.427

<font> Bo. <$$font> No Man surely who is not mad.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.428

<font> Ph. <$$font> But they may do Evil.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.429

<font> Bo. <$$font> I wish they could not.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,168.430

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then since he who can only do Good, can
<P_169> do all things, and those who are powerful to do Evil $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} do all things, it is most evident that those who do Evil
are less powerful.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.431

And yet it further assists me towards the proving of what I have shewed
, that all Power is to be reckoned amongst things to be desired; and
that all things are to be referr'd to the chief Good, as the Height and
Eminency of their Nature: BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.432

But the Power of committing Wickedness $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be referred
to that Good; BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.433

therefore it is not desirable: BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.434

but all Power is desirable.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.435

It is therefore clear that the Power of doing Evil is not Power.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.436

Upon the whole Matter, from hence the Power of good Men, and the undoubted
Weakness of evil Men may well appear.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.437

Hence also is the Opinion of <font> Plato <$$font> verified, That only
wise Men can attain to that which they desire, whilst the Wicked, let
them endeavour what they will, can never acccomplish what they desire
to themselves, that is, to aim at Happiness; BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.438

for they do what they list, whilst by those Actions in which they
delight, they think they shall obtain the Good which they desire;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.439

but they can never be Possessors of it, BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.440

for Impiety can never be crown'd with Happiness.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,169.441

<P_170>

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> III.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,170.444

<$$heading>

<font> Phil. <$$font> Dost thou see then in what a Puddle of Filth
Impiety doth wallow, and with what Rays of Light Goodness doth shine out?
By which it is clear, that good Men <P_171> never go without a Reward,
and evil Men without Punishment; BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.446

for that which causes any thing to be undertaken and done, may
justly be said to be the Reward of that thing which is done; as the
Crown which is won is the Reward of him who runs in the Race for it.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.447

But we have already shewn that Happiness is that Good for which all
Matters are undertaken.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.448

Therefore Happiness is the Reward propos'd to all humane Actions;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.449

and of this the Vertuous can by no means be deprived,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.450

nor can any Man by right be called good who wanteth Goodness;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.451

therefore Vertue can never want its Reward.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.452

But however evil Men may be unquiet or rage, yet the Crown shall
never fall from the head of the wise Man, nor wither upon it.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.453

Nor can the impiety of another Man bereave a worthy Soul of its Honour:
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.454

But if a Man be carried away by the Enjoyment of any foreign Good,
he may be deprived even of this, either by him who gave it to him,
or by any other.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.455

But because every Man's proper Good procureth to him his Reward, whosoever
ceaseth to be good loseth that Reward.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.456

Lastly, since a reward is desired, because it is supposed to be a Good ,
who will judg him who is capable of Good to be uncapable of a Reward?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.457

But thou wilt say, of what Reward is he worthy?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.458

Of the fairest, certainly, and most considerable.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,171.459

Call to mind that remarkable <P_172> Corollary, which a little before
gathered, I gave to thee, BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.460

and consider thus: BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.461

Since the Sovereign Good is Happiness, it appears that all good Men,
in that they are good, become happy; BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.462

and those who are good, are as it were Gods.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.463

Therefore is the Reward of vertuous Men such, that no time shall
impair it, no Power diminish it, nor any Impiety darken it.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.464

Since these things then are thus, a wise Man $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
at all doubt of the Punishment which inseparably attends wicked Men.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.465

For since Good and Evil are Contraries, so are Rewards, and Punishments
: BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.466

therefore as we see that Rewards follow good Actions, there must
necessarily also, on the other hand, be the Punishment for Evil.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.467

Then as Vertue it self is a Reward to vertuous Men, so Vice is a
Punishment to the Wicked: BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.468

whoever then is punished with Pain and Uneasiness, it is not to be
doubted is affected with Evil.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.469

If therefore they will rightly weigh themselves, can they seem to be
free from Punishments, whom Wickedness, the most extreme Evil, doth not
only affect, but even vehemently infect?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.470

But now behold, on the other hand, what Punishment attends evil Doers ;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.471

for thou hast learnt a little before, that every Being is one, and that
that one is Good.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.472

Hence it follows, that every thing which is, or hath a Being, seems to
be good: BOETHPR-E3-P2,172.473

Whatsoever then fails to be good, fails to be: So that <P_173> it appears
that evil Men cease to be what they were; BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.474

but the remaining Form of the Body shews that these evil Men were before
however Men; wherefore when they lose their Vertue, they also lose their
humane Nature.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.475

But since only Vertue can carry Men above the common Pitch of Humanity ,
it is sure that those whom Vice hath deposed from the common Condition of
Mankind, it must also throw below the Merit of Men.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.476

Then it happens that you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} esteem him to be a Man,
whom you see thus transform'd by his Vices.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.477

Doth the violent Oppressor, and the Ravisher of other Mans Goods, burn
with Avarice?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.478

Thou mayst say that he resembles the Wolf.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.479

Is he fierce; BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.480

and doth he give himself over to Controversie and Chiding?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.481

Thou mayst compare him to the Dog.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.482

Is he treacherous, and one who delights to deceive?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.483

He is then like the young Foxes.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.484

Is he intemperate in his Anger?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.485

He seems to carry about with him the Fury of the Lion.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.486

Is he timorous and fearful of what ought not to be fear'd?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.487

He is like the Hart.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.488

Is he light, BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.489

and doth he inconstantly change his Purposes?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.490

He differs nothing from the Birds of the Air.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.491

Doth he wallow in filthy and unclean Lusts?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.492

He rolls himself in the Mire like the nasty Sow.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.493

So that whosoever leaves off to be vertuous, ceases to be a Man;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.494

and since he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attain to a Divine Nature, he is
turn'd into a Beast.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,173.495

<heading>

<font> PROSA <$$font> V.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,186.499

<$$heading>

<font> Boet. <$$font> Here I plainly see what Happiness or Misery
is placed in the Deserts of good and of evil Men.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,186.501

But in this same common Estate of Fortune I perceive something both of
Good and Evil: BOETHPR-E3-P2,186.502

For no wise Man had rather be expos'd to Banishment, Poverty, and
Ignominy, than excel in Riches, Honours, Power, and continue in a
flourishing Estate in his own Country.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,186.503

For in this the more clearly and openly the Duty of Wisdom doth appear,
when the Happiness of the Governours is in some measure diffused, and
communicated to Subjects; whilst Imprisonment, and all legal Punishments
are only due to those pernicious <P_187> and profligate Citizens, for
whom they were at first instituted and appointed.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.504

Why then should things suffer so unnatural a Change?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.505

Why should Punishments due to Crimes, oppress the Good, and the Rewards of
Vertue be born only by wicked and flagitious Men?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.506

These things I much wonder at, BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.507

and I desire to learn from thee what may be the Reason of so unjust
a Distribution.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.508

For my Wonder would be less, did I believe all things to be governed
by Chance.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.509

But now even God, the Governour of all things, doth heighten my
Astonishment, who whilst he doth often distribute good things to the good,
and evil things to the Wicked, yet doth sometimes give to the Vertuous
an hard Portion, and to the impious Man he grants his Heart's Desire.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.510

What Difference then is there to be found, unless Men may be acquainted
with the Cause betwixt his Proceedings and the Actings of Chance?
BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.511

<font> Ph. <$$font> Nor is it at all to be admired if Men
fancy something fresh and confus'd in these Methods of Acting, if
they are ignorant of the Reason of that order by which God proceeds.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.512

But although thou art ignorant of the Cause of this great Disposal of
things, yet because the good Governour of all things doth temper and
inform the world, never doubt but that all things are done rightly and
as they ought to be.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,187.513

<font> PROSA <$$font> VII.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.517

<$$heading>

<font> Phil. <$$font> Dost thou not see now what follows from
all the things which I have spoken.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.519

<font> Bo. <$$font> What is the Consequence?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.520

<font> Ph. <$$font> That all Fortune is good.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.521

<font> Bo. <$$font> And how, I $pray $thee {TEXT:prithee}, can
that be?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.522

<font> Ph. <$$font> Observe then that since all Fortune is either
prosperous or adverse, it is given either to reward or exercise the Good,
or to punish or correct the Bad; BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.523

and all Fortune is good which appears to be either just or profitable.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.524

<font> Bo. <$$font> The Reason is most true, BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.525

and if I consider the Doctrine either of Providence or Fate, which a
little before thou taughtest me, thy Opinion is founded upon a firm
Ground.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.526

But let us range it, if thou pleasest, amongst those Positions which,
a little before, thou saidst were not commonly believed by the People.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.527

<font> Ph. <$$font> Why so?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,203.528

<font> Bo. <$$font> Because it is the common and frequent
Phrase of Men, that the Fortune <P_204> of such an one is bad.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.529

<font> Ph. <$$font> Wilt thou then that I shall for a while draw
nearer to the Peoples way of Discourse, lest we should seem too much to
have receded from the Usages of Mankind?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.530

<font> Bo. <$$font> As thou pleasest.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.531

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thinkest thou not then that every thing which
is profitable is good?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.532

<font> Bo. <$$font> Yes surely.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.533

<font> Ph. <$$font> But whatsoever doth either exercise or correct
is profitable.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.534

<font> Bo. <$$font> I confess it.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.535

<font> Ph. <$$font> Therefore $'t $is {TEXT:'tis} good.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.536

<font> Bo. <$$font> Why should it not?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.537

<font> Ph. <$$font> But this is the Fortune of them who are either
fixed in Vertue, and wage a constant War against Adversity, or of those
who, abandoning Vice, take the way of Vertue.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.538

<font> Bo. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deny it.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.539

<font> Ph. <$$font> But what sayst thou of that pleasant Fortune
which is given as a Reward to good Men, BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.540

do the <font> Many <$$font> conceive it to be ill?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.541

<font> Bo. <$$font> Certainly no, BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.542

but rather they believe it to be very good, as it is indeed.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.543

<font> Ph. <$$font> But what sayst thou of that other, which
although it be sharp, and inflicts just Punishment upon the Wicked,
BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.544

do Men take it to be good?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.545

<font> Bo. <$$font> No sure, BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.546

but rather the most wretched and tormenting thing that can be thought
upon.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.547

<font> Ph. <$$font> Behold then, BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.548

and mark well, if we, following the Opinion of The People, have not
concluded something which is very contrary to the common Opinion.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.549

<font> Bo. <$$font> What is that?  BOETHPR-E3-P2,204.550

<font> Ph. <$$font> It followeth clearly to the things before
granted, that whatsoever the Fortune of all those who are either in
possession of, or <P_205> growing in Vertue, or otherwise in search
after her, may be, it is good; but that the Fortune of those who live
in impiety and sin must be the worst of any thing.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.551

<font> Bo. <$$font> That is true, although no one dare confess it.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.552

<font> Ph. <$$font> Why so, BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.553

for the wise Man ought not to be cast down when he is brought into the
Field to wage War with Fortune, no more than the valiant Man ought to be
dismayed when he hears the Trumpet sound to Battel: BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.554

For Difficulty and Hardship giveth the Occasion to one that he may
encrease and propagate his Glory; and to the other, that he may confirm
and improve his Wisdom.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.555

From hence is Vertue denominated, because leaning upon its own Strength,
and confiding in its proper Force, it is not to be overcome by Adversity
: BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.556

Nor thou who art so far advanced in the Course of Vertue, art not to be
carried away by Delights, and to wallow in Lust; BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.557

thou must engage valiantly and fiercely against every Fortune.
BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.558

And lest Adversity should oppress thee, or Prosperity corrupt thee,
possess thy self of the Golden Mean, BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.559

and retain it with all thy Strength: BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.560

For whatsoever is below, or goeth beyond that, implies a contempt of
true Happiness, BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.561

and loseth the Reward of its Labour.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.562

It lieth in thy own Hand to choose what Fortune thou likest;
BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.563

for al Fortune which seemeth sharp and grievous, unless it exercise
the Vertues of the Good, or chastise the Impiety of the Wicked, is
a Punishment.  BOETHPR-E3-P2,205.564
