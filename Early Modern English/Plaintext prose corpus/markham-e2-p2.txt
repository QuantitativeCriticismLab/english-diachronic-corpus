CHAP. VI.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,79.14.3

<font> Of the ordering and dyettng of the running Horse.  <$$font>
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,79.14.4

<$$heading>

If one Husband-man haue his minde taken vp onely with the delight of
running <font> horses <$$font> which is a noble sport, and though not of
so long indurance, yet equall with anie before spoke of, he shall for the
bettring of his knowledge giue to his memorie these fewe rules following,
by which he shall rightly order and diet him.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,79.14.6

First for his taking vp from grasse <paren> for there for order sake
we must first beginne <$$paren> it shall bee at the same time of the
yeere and after the same manner that you tooke vp your hunting <font>
horse <$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,79.14.7

and till you haue enseamed him, hardned his flesh, taken awaie his
inward grease, and brought him to a good perfectnesse of winde, you
shall cloath him, dresse him, water him, feede him, exercise <P_1,80>
him, purge him and order him after labour in all points, and all things
as you did your hunting <font> horse <$$font>.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.8

When he is thus cleane of body and winde, you shall then lay on him
some moe clothes then you did on your hunting <font> horse <$$font>, to
purge his body a little the more, and to make him the more apt to sweat,
and euacuate humors as they shall grow, the ordinary quantity whereof
would bee a warme narrow woollen cloth about his body, on either side
his heart: then a faire white sheet, a woollen cloath aboue it, and a
canuasse cloth or two aboue it, and before his brest a woollen cloth at
least two double: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.9

He would continually stand vpon cleane litter, and haue his stable very
darke and perfum'd with giniper, when as the strength of his dunge shall
annoy it.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.10

For his dressing it shall bee in all points done as you did to your
hunting <font> Horse <$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.11

onely to dresse him once a day is sufficient, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.12

and that euer in the afternoone: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.13

but for rubbing his limbes or body with drie cloathes or wispes; you
shall doe that as oft as you come into the stable, prouided that you turne
but his clothes vp, not take them from his body.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.14

You shall water your running <font> Horse <$$font>, as you watered your
hunting <font> horse <$$font>, and giue him the same exercise after it ,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.15

onely you shall not bring him into the stable of at least an houre or
more after he is watred.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.16

The best foodes for your running <font> Horse <$$font>, is either good
sweet oates wel dried, sunned and beaten, or bread made of two parts
wheat, and but on part beanes, and boulted and sifted, and knodden,
as was before shewed: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.17

onely if you adde to your better sort of bread the whites of twentie or
thirty egges, and with the barme a little ale also, it will be much the
better, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.18

for you shall not respect how little water you vse at all,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,80.19

the houres you feed in, and the quantity of your food shall be the same,
and <P_1,81> in the same manner as was mentioned before for the hunting
<font> Horse <$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.20

yet with these obseruations that if your <font> Horse <$$font> be very
leane, sickely, and a weake stomacke, that then you may as before shewed,
giue him with his oates a few spilted beanes, or els wash his oates in
a little strong ale or beare, or in the whites of a couple of egges.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.21

Touching his exercise it consisteth in two kinds, the one airings,
the other coursing: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.22

Airing is a moderate and gentle exercise, which you shall vse morning
and euening, by riding or leading your <font> Horse <$$font> foot pace
<paren> but riding is better and lesse in danger of cold <$$paren> in
the morning after his water vp to the hils, and in the euening after
his water by the riuers side, by the space of an houre or two together ,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.23

and before you lead him forth to aire, you shall be sure to giue him
a rere egge broken into his mouth, as soone as his bridle is put on,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.24

for it will increase wind: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.25

and this airing you shall by no meanes forbeare, but vpon his daies of
purging or sweating, or when it much raineth, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.26

for then to aire is vnwholsome.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.27

Againe if your <font> Horse <$$font> be very fat you shall aire before
Sunne rise; and after Sun set: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.28

but if he be leane, then you shall let him haue all the strength and
comfort of the Sunne you can deuise, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.29

and during this ayring you shall be sure that your <font> horse <$$font>
be cloathed very warme, especially before the breast, and on each side
the hart, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.30

for cold to a running <font> Horse <$$font> is mortall.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.31

You shall course your <font> Horse <$$font> according to his strength,
and ability of body; that is to say twice a weeke, thrice, or as oft as
you see cause, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.32

and you shall course him sometimes in his cloathes to make him sweat,
and consume grease, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.33

and that must be done moderately and gently, and sometimes without his
cloath to increase wind; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.34

and that shall be done sharpely and swiftly: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,81.35

you shall by keeping <P_1,82> your <font> horse <$$font> fasting the
night before, be sure that his bodie be empty before he doe course,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.36

to wash his tongue and nostrels with vineger, or to pisse in his mouth
ere you take his backe is very wholsome; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.37

you shall lead him in your hand well and warme cloathed to the course,
and there vncloath him and rub his limbs well: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.38

then hauing courst him, after a little breath-taking cloath him againe
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.39

and so ride him home, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.40

there rub him thorowly, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.41

and let him stand till he be fully cold, which perceiued, let his first
meat you giue him, be a handfull or two of the eares of pollard wheat:
then after his ordinary food as aforesaid.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.42

There is also another exercise for your running <font> horse <$$font>
, which is sweats in his cloathes either abroad or in the house,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.43

for sweats in his cloathes abroad, they are those which are taken vpon the
course, and are formerly spoke of that they must be giuen by a moderate
galloping, no maine running, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.44

and as soone as your <font> horse <$$font> hath past ouer his course,
and is in a hie sweat, you shall instantly haue him home, and there lay
more cloaths vpon him, and keepe him stirring till hee haue sweat so in
the stable an houre or more: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.45

Then abate his cloathes by little and little, till he be perfect cooled
and dried, which you must further by rubbing him continually with
drie cloathes, and by laying drie cloaths on and taking the wet away,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.46

but for sweats in his cloaths without any exercise abroad, you shall giue
them either when the weather is so much vnseasonable, that you $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} go forth, or when your <font> horse <$$font> is so much
in danger of lamenes, that you dare not straine him, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.47

and you shall doe it thus: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.48

First take a blanket folded and warmed very hot, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.49

and wrap it about his body MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.50

then ouer it lay two or three more, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.51

and wispe them round, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.52

then ouer them as many couerlids, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,82.53

and pinne <P_1,83> them fast and close, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.54

then make the <font> horse <$$font> stirre vp and downe in the stable
till hee begin to sweat, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.55

then lay on more cloathes, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.56

and as the sweat trickleth downe his face, so rubbe it awaie with drie
cloathes till hee haue sweat sufficiently, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.57

then as before shewed abate the cloathes by little and little,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.58

and rubbe him in euery part till he be as drie as at first.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.59

After euery course or sweat you shall scowre or purge your <font> horse
<$$font> in the same manner, and with the same medicine that {with}
you did your hunting <font> horse <$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.60

for it is the best that can by art be inuented, being both a purge
and a restoratiue, cleansing and comforting all the parts of a <font>
horses <$$font> body; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.61

but if you thinke it purgeth not enough, then you shal take twenty
reasins of the sunne the stones pickt out, and ten figges slit in the
midst, boile them in a pottle of faire running water, till it come to
be thicke, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.62

then mixe it with powder of Licoras, Anyseeds and Suger-candie till it
come to a stiffe paste, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.63

then make pretty round balls thereof, and roule them vp in butter
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.64

and giue your <font> horse <$$font> three or fowre of them the next
morning after his sweat or course, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.65

and ride him an hower after, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.66

and then set him vp warme.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.67

After your <font> horse <$$font> hath been courst or sweat, and is as
before said, colde and drie, you shall then vnbridle him, giue him some
fewe wheate eares, and then at an howre or two after a little of a very
sweete mash, then some bread; after which at his due hower dresse him,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.68

and giue him when you find him thirstie some cold water with a ball of
your leauen dissolued into it, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.69

and so let him stand till you feed him for all night.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.70

Course not your <font> horse <$$font> sore for at least fowre or fiue
daies before you runne your match, least the sorenesse of his limbes
abate him of his speede.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,83.71

<P_1,84>

Except your <font> horse <$$font> be a very fowle feeder muzzel him not
aboue two or three nights before his match, and the night before his
bloody courses.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.73

Giue your <font> horse <$$font> as well his gentle courses as his sharp
courses vpon the race he must run, that hee may as well finde comfort
as displeasure thereon.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.74

In training of your <font> horse <$$font> obserue not the number
the miles, but the labour fit for your <font> horse <$$font>.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.75

Be sure vpon the match day that your <font> horse <$$font> be emptie,
and that he take his rest vntroubled till you prepare to leade him forth.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.76

Shooe your <font> horse <$$font> euer a daie before you runne him
, that the paine of the hammers knocks may bee out of his feete.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.77

Saddle your <font> horse <$$font> on the race day in the stable before
you leade him forth, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.78

and fixe both the pannell and the girthes to his backe and sides with
Shooe-makers waxe to preuent all daungers.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.79

Leade your <font> Horse <$$font> to his course with all gentlenesse,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.80

and giue him leaue to smell to other <font> horses <$$font> dungs that
thereby he may be inticed to stale and emptie his bodie as he goes.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.81

When you come to the place where you must start, first rubbe his limmes
well, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.82

then vncloath him, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.83

then rake his backe MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.84

and the word giuen start him with all gentlenesse and quietnesse that
may bee, least dooing any thing rashly, you happen to choake him in his
owne winde.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.85

And thus much for the ordering and dietting of the running <font>
horse <$$font>, and the particularities belonging to the same.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,84.86

Now for our Husbandmans trauelling <font> horse <$$font>, which is to
carrie him in his iournies and about his necessarie businesse <P_1,85>
in the countrie; he shall first feede him with the best sweet hey,
drie oates, or drie beanes and oates mixt together, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.87

in his trauell he shall feede him according to his stomacke more or
lesse, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.88

and in his rest at a certaine proportion, as halfe a pecke at each
warring is vtterly sufficient.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.89

In your trauell feede your <font> horse <$$font> early that hee may take
his rest soone.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.90

In trauell by no meanes wash nor walke your <font> horse <$$font>,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.91

but be sure to rubbe him cleane.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.92

Water him a mile before you come to your Inne, or more as shall lie in
your iourney, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.93

or if you faile thereof forbeare it till next morning,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.94

for water hath often done hurt, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.95

want of water neuer did anie.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.96

Let your <font> horse <$$font> neither eate nor drinke when he is extreame
hot, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.97

for both are vnholsome.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.98

When the daies are extreame hot labour your <font> horse <$$font>
morning and euening MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.99

and forbeare hie noone.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.100

Take not your saddle off sodainly but at leasure, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.101

and laying on the cloath set on the saddle againe till hee bee colde.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.102

Litter your <font> horse <$$font> deepe, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.103

and in the daies of his rest let it lie also vnder him.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.104

Dresse your <font> horse <$$font> twice a daie when he rests, and once
when he trauels.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.105

If the <font> horse <$$font> be stoned let him goe to soile and be purged
with grasse in <font> May <$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.106

a month is time long enough, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.107

and that grasse which growes in Orchards vnder trees is best.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.108

Let blood Spring and Fall, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.109

for they are the best times to preuent sicknesses.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.110

In your iourneying light at euerie steepe hill, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.111

for it is a great refreshing and comfort to your <font> Horse <$$font>.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,85.112

Before your sleepe euerie night in your iourney, see <P_1,86> all your
<font> Horses <$$font> feet stopt with Oxe dung, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,86.113

for it taketh awaie the heate of trauell and surbating.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,86.114

Many other necessarie rules there are but so depending vpon these already
shewed, that whoso keepeth them shall not be ignorant of any of the rest,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,86.115

for they differ more in name then nature.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,86.116

<heading>

<font> The end of Hors-manshippe.  <$$font> MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,86.118

<$$heading>

<P_1,97>

Now if the mind of our <font> Husbandman <$$font> be not so generally
taken with the delight and pleasure of this recreation of Hawking,
but that he preferreth before it the delight of coursing of Greyhounds,
which is a very noble and worthy pastime, hee shall in it obserue these
foure things, the breede of <font> Greyhounds <$$font>, their shape,
their diet, and the lawes belonging to the same.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,97.121

Touching the breed of <font> Greyhounds <$$font> you are principallie to
respect the Countreyes in which they are bred and nourished, as that it
be a champayne plaine and without couert, where a <font> Hare <$$font>
may stand forth and indure a course of two miles or more, as it shal
happen <paren> for the coursing of the <font> Hare <$$font>, is that
which I purpose most to entreat of <$$paren> because in a close country
full of couert, where a <font> Hare <$$font> $can $not {TEXT:cannot} run
aboue a quarter of a mile or lesse: both the pleasure of the recreation
is taken away, and the <font> Greyhound <$$font> by an insufficient
exercise is made vnapt, and vnfit for that for which he was created.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,97.122

Now of champaine countries MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,97.123

they are of three kinds MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,97.124

as the low vales, as are the vale of Beluoire, the vale of white
horse, the vale of Eusham and such like, the high downes and heaths
as about <font> Salisbury, Cysseter, Lincolne <$$font>, and many such
like places, and the middle betweene both as the County of <font>
Northampton <$$font>, and <font> Leicester <$$font>, and others
like them: All which are very excellent places for the breeding
<P_1,98_misnumbered_as_8> and training vp of the best <font> Greyhounds
<$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,98_misnumbered_as_8.125

yet of the three your valles or middle soiles, which for the most part
are errable grounds, are much better to breed and traine on, then your
downes and heathes, because they are much more laborsome, rough , heauy,
and in the winter season full of much trouble and false foot hould,
in so mucst {COM:sic} that a <font> Dogge <$$font> which is able to
runne, strongly, swiftlie, and surely there, must necessarily doe it
ten times better when he comes to the smooth, plaine and carpet like
downe, $where $on {TEXT:whereon} the contrary the <font> Dogge <$$font>
which is trained vpon those euen downes, though he be right famous and
excellent, when he comes to run in the deepe well plowed field, is to
seeke where to bestow his feet, and can neither shee {COM:sic} speed,
round, nor indurance.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,98_misnumbered_as_8.126

Now the Gentlemen which dwell on the downes and plain grounds to maintaine
the reputation of their <font> Dogs <$$font> affirme them to be much
more nimble and cunning in turning, then the vale <font> Dogs <$$font>
be, because the fairenes of the earth giuing them so much aduantage
ouer the <font> Hare <$$font>, that hauing her euen <paren> as it were
<$$paren> in a manner vnder their feet, shee is put more to her shifts ,
and striues with great art of sleights to deceiue, and get aduantage of
the <font> Greyhound <$$font>: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,98_misnumbered_as_8.127

And it is true, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,98_misnumbered_as_8.128

for by reason of the aduantage of their hils, which are great
and steepe, though smooth and plaine, I haue seene a vale <font>
Dogge <$$font> so much deceiued, that vpon a turne hee hath lost
more ground then hath beene recouerable, in the whole course after;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,98_misnumbered_as_8.129

but this is no want of goodnes but a little skil which a mo~ths coursing
will bring a <font> Dogge <$$font> so sufficiently vnto, that he will
not need any other reformation then the knowledge of his error, by his
losse of labor.  So that I conclude the good <font> Dogge <$$font> vpon
the deepes will euer beate the good <font> Dogs <$$font> on the plaine.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,98_misnumbered_as_8.130

It is an old receiued opinion amongst many men of the <P_1,99> leashe
that the <font> Greyhound <$$font> bitch, will euer beat the <font>
Greyhound <$$font> dog, by reason of her more nimblenes, quicknes,
and agillitie: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.131

And it is sometimes seene that a perfect good <font> bitch <$$font>
indeed, hath much aduantage of an ordinary <font> dogge <$$font>:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.132

but if the good <font> dogge <$$font> meet with the good <font> bitch
<$$font>, there is then no comparison, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.133

but the <font> Dogge <$$font> will be her master, in as much as he
exceedeth her both in length, and strength, the two maine helps in
coursing; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.134

for her nimblenes is then no helpe, sith a good <font> Dogge <$$font>
in the turne will loose as little ground, as any <font> Bitch <$$font>
whatsoeuer.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.135

Yet thus much I would perswade all Gentlemen of the leashe to be very
carefull in their breeding, to breed vpon the best <font> Bitches <$$font>
they can prouide, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.136

for it is found in experience that the best <font> Dogge <$$font> vpon
any indifferent <font> bitch <$$font> will not get so good a whelpe, as
an indifferent <font> Dogge <$$font> vpon the best <font> Bitch <$$font>
; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.137

And amongst these obseruations in breeding <font> Grey-hounds <$$font>;
you shall obserue to haue your <font> Dogges <$$font> and <font> Bitches
<$$font> of equall and indifferent ages, as about three or foure yeeres
old at the most; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.138

but in case of need, your <font> Bitch <$$font> will indure a great
deale longer then your <font> Dogge <$$font>, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.139

and to breed with a young <font> Dogge <$$font> on an olde <font>
Bitch <$$font>, may bring forth an excellent <font> whelpe <$$font>.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.140

Touching the shapes of <font> Grey-hounds <$$font> <paren> from whence
you shall take the best collections for their goodnesses <$$paren>
they are certaine and most infallable: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.141

Therefore touching <font> Grey-hounds <$$font>, when they are puppies
or young whelpes, those which are most raw-bon'd leane, loose made,
sickly or crooke hought, and generally vnknit in euery member, are
euer likely to make the best <font> Dogges <$$font>, and most shapely:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.142

but such as in the first three or foure monthes, are round and close
trust, fat, straight, and as it were full sum'd and knit in euery member,
neuer prooue good, swift or comely.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,99.143

<P_1,100>

Now after your Dogge comes to full growth, as at a yeere and a halfe or
two yeeres old, he would then haue a fine long leane head, with a sharpe
nose rush-growne, from the eies downeward: A full cleere eie with long
eie lids; a sharpe eare short and close falling, a long necke a little
bending, with a loose hanging wezand: a broad breast straight forelegs,
side hollow ribs, a straight square and flat backe, short and strong
fillets, a broad space betweene the hips; a long stearne or taile and
a round foot: and good large cleis.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,100.145

Now for the better helpe of your memory I will giue you an old rime,
left by our Forefathers, from which you shall vnderstand the true shapes
of a perfect <font> Grey-hound; <$$font> MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,100.146

and this it is.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,100.147

{COM:verse_omitted}

These being the principall members of a good <font> grey-hound
<$$font> , if they resemble the proportions of the things a boue
named, the dogge $can $not {TEXT:cannot} chuse but bee most perfect.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,100.149

When you haue thus a perfect and well-shap't <font> grey-hound <$$font>
, your next rule is to apply your selfe to the dyetting and ordering of
him, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,100.150

for the pleasure to which you keepe him, that bringing him to the
vttermost height of strength of winde, you may know the vttermost
goodnesse that is within him, which disorderly and fowle keeping <P_1,101>
will conceale, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.151

and you loose a Iewell for want of knowledge of the value.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.152

Dietting then of <font> grey-hounds <$$font> consisteth in fowre
especiall things, to wit, foode, exercise, ayring, and kennelling, the
first nourishing the bodie, the second the limbes, the third the winde
and the last the spirits.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.153

To speake then first of foode, it is two-fold, either generall, or
particular; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.154

generall as for a continuall vpholding and maintaining of a dogge in good
state of bodie, being in good plight and liking, or particular when a
dogge is either poore, sicke, or prepared for wadger standeth in neede
of particular foods of aduantage.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.155

The best generall foods for the ordinarie vpholding of a dogge in a
good state of body is chippings, crusts of bread, soft tender bones or
grissels of Veale, Lambe, or such like; first scalded in beefe-broth not
very salt; or other broath in which hath beene boiled, mutton, veale,
venison, or anie kinde of Pullen, or for want thereof, other cleane
scalding water; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.156

after your chippings or bread is scaulded you shall let it stand and
coole, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.157

then when your feeding hower commeth, you shall take as much
good milke, floten milke, or butter milke <paren> but the best is
best wholsom <$$paren> as will fully or more then whiten the same
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.158

for it is to be intended that your water must be all drunk vp into your
bread, and your milke must onely make it swimme, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.159

and with this feede your dogge morning and euening after you come from
walking him, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.160

and giue him a good and sufficient meale thereof, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.161

for this will onely maintaine and vphold him in good state of body,
being strong and lustie in flesh before.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.162

For particular food which is when a dogge is poore, sicke or to be
prepared for wadger they be these: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,101.163

First, if he be poore in flesh, sickly or weake, the best food you
can raise him vp withall is to {TEXT:to_to} take sheeps heads wool
<P_1,102> and all cleane washt, and breake them all to peeces,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.164

then put them into a Cauldron or Kettle, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.165

and after the water hath risen and is cleane skumm'd, put vnto it
good store of oat-meale and sweet pot-hearbes smal chopt together
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.166

and so boile it till the flesh be tender; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.167

then with this meat and the pottage feede your <font> grey-hound <$$font>
morning and euening, and it will soone put him into great lust & strength:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.168

but if you will prepare him for match and wadger, then you shall make
him this diet-bread, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.169

take a pecke of the finest and driest oat-meale, and two pecks of good
wheat, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.170

and hauing ground them together, boult the meale thorough a fine boulting
cloath, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.171

and then scattring amongst it a prittie quantitie of Any-seeds and
Licoras wel beaten together, kneade it vp with the whites of egges,
newe ale and barme mixt together, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.172

and so bake it in prettie round loaues reasonable hard,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.173

with this bread either scalded, as was before shewed in your chippings
, or put into the pottage with the Sheepes-heads warm, feed your dogge
morning and euening, to wit halfe an hower after sunne rise, and halfe
an hower before sunne set, when you come from walking or ayring him,
and it will bring him to exceeding great strength of bodie and purenesse
of winde.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.174

For the exercise of your <font> grey hound <$$font>, it consisteth
likewise in two things, coursing and ayring; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.175

and they be euery way as necessary as is foode, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.176

because it only bringeth abilitie to his limbes and perfitnesse to his
winde: MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.177

to speake then of coursing, you shall not faile to course him at least
twice a weeke if your courses be strong and long, thrice a weeke, if
they be but reasonable as a mile or a mile and a halfe at most, and some
times if your courses be short and vnder a mile.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.178

In coursing you shall obserue two things blood and labour;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,102.179

blood which is a hartning and animating of your dogge to delight in
the <P_1,103> pleasure, when he finds the rewards of his paines taking;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,103.180

for if a dogge course continually and neuer kill, the sport will growe
yrksome vnto him, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,103.181

and therefore now and then, giue him such aduantage that he may kill
the Hare, MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,103.182

then labour, which is contrarie to killing; MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,103.183

for in it you must giue the Hare all indifferent aduantages, both by
lawe and otherwise, whereby she may stand long before the dogge, and
make him shewe his vttermost strength before he be able to reach her.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,1,103.184

<P_2,114>

The best vse of buttermilke for the able Hus-wife is charitablie to
bestow it on the poore Neighbors, whose wants doe dailie crie out for
sustenance: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.186

and no doubt but she shall finde the profit thereof in a diuine place,
as well as in her earthly businesse: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.187

But if her owne wants command her to vse it for her owne good;
then shee shall of her buttermilke make curds in this manner:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.188

shee shall take her buttermilke and put it into a cleane earthen
vessell, which is much larger then to receiue the Butter-milke onely:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.189

and looking vnto the quantitie thereof shee shall take as it were a
third part so much new Milke and set it on the fire, and when it is
ready to rise, take it off and let it coole a little; then powre it
into the buttermilke in the same manner as {in} you would make a posset,
and hauing stirred it about let it stand: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.190

then with a fine skummer when you will vse the curds <paren> for the
longer it stands the better the curds will eate <$$paren> take them vp
into a cullander MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.191

and let the whey drop well from it: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.192

and then eate them either with Creame, Ale, Wine, or Beere;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.193

as for the Whey you may keepe it also in a sweet stone vessell:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.194

for it is that which is called Whigge, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,114.195

and is an excellent coole drinke <P_2,115> and a wholsome;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.196

and may very well be drunke a summer through in stead of any other drinke
: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.197

and without doubt will slake the thirst of any labouring man as well,
if not better.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.198

The next maine profit which ariseth from the Dairie is Cheese, of which
there be diuers kinds, as new Milke, or morrow milke Cheese, nettle
cheese, flotten milke Cheese, and eddish, or after much {COM:aftermath}
Cheese, all which haue their seueral orderings and compositions as you
shall perceiue by the discourse following: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.199

yet before I doe beginne to speake of the making of the Cheese, I will
shew you how to order your Cheeselep-bag or runnet, which is the most
principall thing wherewith your Cheese is compounded, and giueth the
perfect taste vnto the same.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.200

The Cheeselep-bagge or runnet which is the stomacke bagge of a young
suckling calfe, which neuer tasted other foode then milke, where the
curd lieth vndisgested.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.201

Of these bags you shall in the beginning of the yeere prouide your selfe
good store, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.202

and first open the bagge MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.203

and poure out into a cleane vessell the curde and thicke substance
thereof; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.204

but the rest which is not curdled you shall put away:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.205

then open the curd MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.206

and picke out of it all manner of motes, chiers of grasse, or other
filth gotten into the same: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.207

Then wash the curd in so manie cold waters till it be as white and cleane
from all sorts of motes as is possible; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.208

then lay it on a cleane cloth that the water may draine from it, which
done lay it in another drie vessell, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.209

then take a handfull or two of salt MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.210

and rub the curd therewith exceedinglie: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.211

then take your bag MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.212

and wash it also in diuers cold waters till it be verie cleane;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.213

and then put the curd and the salt vp into the bag, the bag being also
well rub'd within with salt: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.214

and so put it vp, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.215

and salt the outside also all ouer: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.216

and then close vp the pot close MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.217

and so keepe them a full yeere before you vse them.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,115.218

For touching <P_2,116> the hanging of them vp in chimney corners <paren>
as course Huswiues doe <$$paren> is sluttish, naught, and vnwholsome,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.219

and the spending of your runnet whilst it is new, makes your Cheese
heaue and proue hollow.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.220

When your runnet or earning is fit to be vsed, you shall season it after
this manner; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.221

you shall take the bagge you intend to vse, and opening it put the curde
into a stone morter or a bowle, and with a woodden pestell or a roling
pinne beat it exceedingly; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.222

then put to it the yelkes of two or three egges, and halfe a pint of
the thickest and sweetest creame you can fleete from your milke, with
a peny-worth of saffron finely dried and beaten to powder together with
a little Cloues and Mace, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.223

and stirre them all passing well together till they appeare but as one
substance, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.224

and then put it vp in the bagge againe: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.225

then you shall make a very strong brine of water and salt,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.226

and in the same you shall boile a handfull or two of Saxifrage,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.227

and then when it is colde claire it into a cleane earthen vessell,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.228

then take out of the bagge halfe a dozen spoonfull of the former curde
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.229

and mixe it with the brine; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.230

then closing the bagge vp againe close hang it within the brine,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.231

and in any case also steepe in your brine a few Wall-nut tree leaues
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.232

and so keepe your runnet a fortnight after before you vse it
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.233

and in this manner dresse all your bagges so as you may euer haue one
ready after another, and the youngest a fortnight old euer at least,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.234

for that will make the $earning {TEXT:earing} quicke and sharp, so that
fowre spoonfuls therof will suffice for the gathering and seasoning of
at least twelue gallons of milke, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.235

and this is the choisest and best earning which can possible be made by
any Hus-wife.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.236

To make a new milke or morning milk cheese, which is the best cheese
made ordinarily in our kingdome; you shal take your milk early in the
morning as it comes from the Cowe, and sile it into a cleane tubbe,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,116.237

then take all the <P_2,117> creame also from the milke you milk the
euening before, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.238

and straine it into your new milke, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.239

then take a pretty quantity of cleane water MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.240

and hauing made it scalding hot powre it into the milke also to scauld
the creame and it together, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.241

then let it stand MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.242

and coole it with a dish til it be no more then luke warme,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.243

then go to the pot where your earning bagges hangs,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.244

and draw from thence so much of the earning without stirring of the
bagge as will serue for your proportion of milke, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.245

and straine it therein very carefully; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.246

for if the least mote of the curd of the earning fall into the cheese
it will make the Cheese rot and mould MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.247

when your earning is put in you shall couer the milke
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.248

and so let it stand halfe an howre or thereabouts, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.249

for if the earning be good it will come in that space;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.250

but if you see it doth not then you shall put in more,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.251

being come you shall with a dish in your hand breake and mash the curd
together, possing and turning it about diuersly, vvhich {COM:sic} done
with the flat palmes of your hands very gently press the curde downe
into the bottome of the tub, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.252

then with a thinne dish take the whey from it as cleane as you can,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.253

and so hauing prepared your Cheese-fat answerable to the proportion of
your curd with both your hands ioined together, put your curd therein
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.254

and breake it MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.255

and presse it downe hard into the fat til you haue fild it;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.256

then lay vpon the top of the curd your flat cheese-boord and a little
small weight therevpon, that the whey may drop from it into the vnder
vessell, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.257

when it hath done dropping take a large cheese cloth,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.258

and hauing wet it in colde water lay it on the cheese-boord
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.259

and then turne the cheese vpon it; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.260

then lay the cloth into the cheese-fat MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.261

and so put the cheese therin againe, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.262

and with a thin slice thrust the same downe close on euery side,
then laying the cloth also ouer the top to lay on the cheese-boord
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.263

and so carrie it to your great presse, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.264

and there presse it vnder a suficient waight; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,117.265

after <P_2,118> it hath been there prest halfe an howre you shall take
it and turne it into a drie cloth and put it into the presse againe,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.266

and thus you shal turne it into drie cloathes at least fiue or sixe
times in the first day, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.267

and euer put it vnder the presse againe, not taking it there-from till
the next day in the evening at soonest, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.268

and the last time it is turned you shall turne it into the drie fat
without any cloth at all.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.269

When it is prest sufficiently and taken from the fat, you shall then lay
it in a kimnell and rub it first on the one side and then on the other
with salt, and so let it lie all that night, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.270

then the next morning you shall do the like againe and so turne it
vpon the brine which comes from the salt two or three daies or more,
according to the bignesse of the cheese, and then lay it vpon a faire
table or shelfe to drie, forgetting not euery day once to rubbe it all
ouer with a cleane cloth, and then to turne it til such time that it be
throughly drie and fit to goe into the presse; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.271

and in this manner of drying you must obserue to lay it, first where
it may drie hastily, and after where it may drie at more leasure:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.272

thus may you make the best and most principall cheese.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.273

Now if you will make Cheese of two meales, as your mornings new milke
, and the euenings Creame milke, and all you shall doe but the same
formerly rehearsed.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.274

And if you will make a simple morrow milke Cheese which is all of
new milke and nothing els: you shall then doe as is before declared,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.275

onely you shall put in your earning so soone as the milke is sil'd
<paren> if it haue any warmth in it <$$paren> and not scald it:
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.276

but if the warmth be lost, you shall put it into a kettell and giue it
the aire of the fire.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.277

If you will haue a very dainty nettle Cheese, which is the finest summer
Cheese which can be eaten; you shall doe in all things as was formerly
taught in the new milke Cheese compound: MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,118.278

Onely you shall put the curd into a <P_2,119> verie thin cheese-fat
, not aboue halfe an inch or a little better deepe at the most;
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.279

and then when you come to dry them as soone as it is drain'd from the
brine, you shall lay it upon fresh nettles and couer it all ouer with
the same; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.280

and so lying where they may feele the aire let them ripen therein,
obseruing to renew your nettles once in two daies, and euerie time you
renew them to turne the Cheese or Cheeses, and to gather your nettles
as much without stalkes as may be, and to make the bed both vnder and
a loft as smooth as may be, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.281

for the more euen and fewer wrinckles that your Cheese hath, the more
daintie is your Hus-wife euer accounted.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.282

If you will make floaten milke cheese, which is the coursest of all
cheeses, you shall take some of the milk and heate it upon the fire to
warme all the rest; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.283

but if it be so sower that you dare not aduenter the warming of it for
feare of breaking; then you shall heate water and with it warme it,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.284

then put in your earning as before shewed, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.285

and garner it, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.286

presse it, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.287

salt it MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.288

and drie it as you did all other Cheeses.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.289

Touching your eddish cheese or winter cheese, there is not any
difference betwixt it and your summer cheese touching the making thereof
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.290

only, because the season of the yeere denyeth a kindly drying or hardning
thereof, it differeth much in taste MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.291

and will be soft alwaies, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.292

and of these eddish cheeses you may make as many kindes as of summer
cheeses, as of one meale, two meales, or of milke that is floten.
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.293

When you haue made your Cheese you shall then haue care of the
whey, whose generall vse differeth not from that of butter-milke,
MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.294

for either you shall preserue it to bestow on the poore, because it is
a good drinke for the labouring man, or keep it to make curds out of it
or lastly to nourish and bring up your swine.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,119.295

<P_2,120>

If you will make curds of your best whey, you shall set it vpon the
fire MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.297

and being ready to boile, you shall put into it a pretty quantity of
buttermilke, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.298

and then as you see the curds arising vp to the top of the whey, with
a skummer skimme them off MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.299

and put them into a Cullender, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.300

and then put in more butter-milke, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.301

and thus do whilest you can see any curds arise; MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.302

then the whey being drained cleane from them, put them into a cleane
vessell, MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.303

and so serue them foorth as occasion shall serue.  MARKHAM-E2-P2,2,120.304
