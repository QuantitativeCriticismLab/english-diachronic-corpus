Sir We ar occupyed with many offers to and fro in words,
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.7

but I can not certefy you what shall be determyned.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.8

Yesterday the Towre was flatly refused, WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.9

and instead of Fothryngay, which we thought too far off, Hertford was
named, and next to the Tower thought metest; and so for a tyme both
lyked and mislyked for nearnes to London.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.10

Nevertheless I hope it will be so concluded this daye.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.11

And so I will wryte to S=r= Walter Mildmay for to stey brewyng and
provisions of coale, which by my last I required hym to provyde.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.12

The Queen hath agreed uppon nine Erles besid Counsellors, and uppon
eight or nine Barons to heare the cause.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.13

Hertford shall be metar for such an assemble than Fothryngay can be.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.14

Grafton was also named, but unmete.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.15

We styck uppon Parlement, which hir Ma=ty= mislyketh to have
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.16

but we all persist, to make the Borden better born and the world abrod
better satisfyeed.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.17

Naw offred on Tewsday to have oppened much, WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.18

and in stead therof, he hath only wrytten to have a pardon as yesterday
because it was the Queen's byrth day.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.19

I do send to Mr Mills to challeng hym, and to warn hym to be sent
to the Tower if he do not otherwise acquit hymself of his promis.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.20

I thynk Curle will be more oppen, WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,5.21

and yet Naw hath amply confessed by his hand wrytyng to have <P_1.3,6>
wrytten by the Queen's endityng and hir own minut y=t= long lettre to
Babyngton: WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,6.22

but he wold quallefy his mastris fault in that Babyngton provoked hir
therto, and Morgan prevaled hir to renew hir intelligence with Babyngton.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,6.23

Yours as. W. Burghley.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,6.24

{COM:apostrophe_in_heading_sic}

M=r= Secretary, yesternight, vppon recept of your lettre dated
on Thursday, I wrote what was thought wold be this dayes work.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,12.30

This Queen of the Castell was content to appeare ageyn afor us in
publyck to be hard, but, in truth, not to be hard for hir defence,
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,12.31

for she cold say nothyng but negatyvely, that the poynts of the lettres
that concerned the practise against the Q. Ma=ts= person was
never by hir wrytten, nor of her knolledg, WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,12.32

the rest, for invasion, for scapyng by force, she sayd she wold nether
deny nor affirm.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,12.33

But hir intention was, by long artificiall speches, to move pite, to
laye all blame uppon the Queen's Majesty or rather uppon the Counsell,
that all the troobles past did insew, avowyng hir resonable offers and
our refusalls; WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,12.34

and in this hir speches I did so encounter hir with reasons out <P_1.3,13>
of my knolledg and experience, as she had not that avantage she looked
for; as I am assured the Auditory did fynd hir case not piteable, hir
allegations untrew; by which means gret debate fell yesternight very long
, and this day renewed with gret stomakyng.  WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.35

But we had gret reason to prorog our session which is rone till the 25=th=
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.36

and so we of the Counsell will be at the Court the 22=th=.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.37

And we fynd all persons here in Commission fully satisfyed, as,
by hir Ma=ts= order judgment will be gyven at our next metyng,
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.38

but the record will not be provided in v or vj. dayes,
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.39

and that was on {COM:one} cause, why if we shuld have proceded
to judgment we shuld have tarryed v or vj. dayes more;
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.40

and suerly the Country cold not beare it, by the wast of bread specially ,
our Company being then and within vj myle, above ij. M horssmen :
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.41

but by reson of hir Ma=ts= lettre we of hir Counsell, that is the
L. Chanc. M=r= Rich, M=r= Secr. and my self
only, did procure this prorogation for the other ij. causes.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.42

And so knowyng that by my Lord of Cumberland hir Ma=ty= shall, soner than
this lettre can come, understand the course of the procedyng, I will end.
WCECIL-1580-E2-P2,1.3,13.43

To the right honorable my verie good frend Mr Secretarie Davison.
