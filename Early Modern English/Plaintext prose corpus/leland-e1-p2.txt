part by corne, LELAND-E1-P2,102.3

and parte by pasture, LELAND-E1-P2,102.4

and sum baren hethy and sandy ground.  LELAND-E1-P2,102.5

About the castelle self and the toune of Antehille is faire wood.
LELAND-E1-P2,102.6

The castelle and town of Antehille with diverse fair lordshippes
$thereabout longgid to the L. Fannope, a man of great
renowne in the raigns of Henry the v. and Henry the syxte.
{COM:20_words_from_'to'_to_'syxte'_interpolated} LELAND-E1-P2,102.7

This Lorde Fannope buildid this castelle as it is now stonding stately
on an hille, with a 4. or 5. faire towers of stone in the
inner warde, beside the basse-courte, of such spoiles as it is saide
that he wanne in Fraunce.  LELAND-E1-P2,102.8

<P_103>

It apperith by the este wyndow in the chapelle withyn the castelle of
Anthille that he maried yn a noble blood: LELAND-E1-P2,103.10

as I remembre she was the Duches of Excestre; LELAND-E1-P2,103.11

it may chaunce that the mariage of her was a great cause of the sumptuus
building there.  LELAND-E1-P2,103.12

This Lorde Fannope lyith at the blake freres in London, as I have lernid,
and his wife on the right hand of hym and a childe.  LELAND-E1-P2,103.13

How the Lorde Gray of Ruthin cam to this castelle and landes aboute it,
I have hard these thinges folowing told for a verite.  LELAND-E1-P2,103.14

In the tyme of the civile war betwixt King Henry the $vi.
and King Edwarde the $iv. $there was a $battaile
faught hard without the south suburbes of Northampton.

LELAND-E1-P2,103.15

The Lorde Fannope tooke totally King Henry's parte.  LELAND-E1-P2,103.16

The Lorde Gray of Ruthine did the same in countenance.
LELAND-E1-P2,103.17

But a litle afore the feeld he practised with King Edward, other saying
that he had a title to the Lorde Fannopes landes at Antehil and there
aboute, or depraving {COM:sic} hym with false accusations so wrought
with King Edwarde, that he with al his strong band of Walschemen felle to
King Edwardes part, apon promise that if Edward wan the feelde he shaul
have Antehil and such landes as Fannope had there.  LELAND-E1-P2,103.18

Edwarde wan the feelde, LELAND-E1-P2,103.19

and Gray opteinid Antehille <font> cum pertinentiis <$$font>:
LELAND-E1-P2,103.20

But wither the Lord Fannope were slayn at $this feelde $or no I am
not sure.  LELAND-E1-P2,103.22

The market town of $Antehill is praty and welle $favoridly buildyd,
LELAND-E1-P2,103.23

There rennith a broket, as I remember, by the est part of the toune.
LELAND-E1-P2,103.26

From Antehill to Dunestaple a x. miles, or more.
LELAND-E1-P2,103.27

First I passid partely by wooddy ground and enclosures, but after moste

LELAND-E1-P2,104.29

Mergate was a nunnery of late tyme, LELAND-E1-P2,104.30

it standith on an hil in a faire woode hard by Watheling-Streate on the
est side of it.  LELAND-E1-P2,104.31

Humfrey Boucher, base sunne to the late Lorde Berners, did much coste
in translating of the priorie into a maner place: LELAND-E1-P2,104.32

but he left it nothing endid.  LELAND-E1-P2,104.33

Ther is a litle south of the priorie a long thorough fare
on Watheling-Streate meately welle buildid for low housing.
LELAND-E1-P2,104.34

About the midle of this town I passid half a mile by hilly ground as in
the beginning of Chilterne, LELAND-E1-P2,104.35

and ther I saw in a praty wood side S. Leonardes on the lifte
hand, scant half a mile of toward north weste.  Wher of late tyme was
a priorie of nunnes.  LELAND-E1-P2,104.36

Master Page the knight hath it now in exchaunge for landes of his in

Thens by Chiltern-hilles and baren, wooddy, and ferne ground for the

a roote of an hille stonding sum what low, and environid with a mote,
to the which, as I coulde perceyve, part of the water of the ryver there
hard by doth resorte.  LELAND-E1-P2,104.42

I markid dyverse towers in the midle warde of the castelle, and the
dungeon hille.  LELAND-E1-P2,104.43

But to my sighte it is much in ruine.  LELAND-E1-P2,104.44

The house of Bonehomes, caullid Asscheruge, of the fundation of Edmunde
, Erle of Cornewale, and owner of Berckhamstede-Castel, is about a mile

After that I had veuyd the castel, I passid over the ryver wher as is
a bridge of wood.  LELAND-E1-P2,105.47

This ryver cummith by northe-west from Penley, a place yn Chiltern a

Berkhamstede is one of the best markette townes in Hertfordeshire,
LELAND-E1-P2,105.50

and hath a longe streate metely welle buildid from the north to the

The house is within diverse places richely paintid with antique workes
of white and blak.  LELAND-E1-P2,105.60

And there be about the house 2. parkes, as I remembre.
LELAND-E1-P2,105.61

The maner place stondeth at the west ende of the paroche chirche.
LELAND-E1-P2,105.62

In the paroche on the northe side of it, as in a chapelle, be 2.

From Brentford to Hundeslawe 2. miles.  LELAND-E1-P2,107.81

There was in the west ende of the toune an house of freres of the ordre

A litle beyond this village is a bridge of tymbre at the which the mille
water of Langford breking out above yn the medowes doth mete with one of
the 2. greate principale armes that brekith out of Colne brooke.
LELAND-E1-P2,107.86

and metith not very far beneth Langford bridge with the principal streme
of Colne.  LELAND-E1-P2,107.88

A litle beyond Langford bridge is a bridge of wood, under the which the
principal streame of Colne ryver rennith, LELAND-E1-P2,107.89

and thens more then a mile goith into Tamise by Stanes chirch a litle

From this bridge to Colebrok bridge of tymbre about a mile.
LELAND-E1-P2,107.92

LELAND-E1-P2,108.96

Uxbridge 3. miles from Colebrook toune.  LELAND-E1-P2,108.97

This arme rennith by it self about a mile and a half beneth Colebrook

LELAND-E1-P2,108.98

Colebrook toun is a 2. miles from Stanes.  LELAND-E1-P2,108.99

The toune of Colebrok is set on eche side of the ryver of Cole,
LELAND-E1-P2,108.100

but the far greatter part of it is on the west side of the ryver:
LELAND-E1-P2,108.101

A 2. or 3. miles beyond the passage over Burne I cam to
Maidenhed bridge of tymbre apon the Tamise.  LELAND-E1-P2,108.106

A litle above the bridge <font> ripa citeriori Tamesis <$$font> I saw a

LELAND-E1-P2,108.108

There is great warfeage of timbre and fier wood on the west ende of the

LELAND-E1-P2,108.113

The Bisshop of Saresbyri hath had at Sunning afore the Conquest an

and hath be {COM:sic} lordes there.  LELAND-E1-P2,109.132

And yet remainith a fair olde house there of stone, even by the Tamise
ripe, longging to the Bisshop of Saresbyri: LELAND-E1-P2,109.133

and therby is a fair parke.  LELAND-E1-P2,109.134

This place is in Barkeshir 3. miles above Henley.
LELAND-E1-P2,109.135

From Sunning to Reading 2. miles.  LELAND-E1-P2,109.136

There is a park cumming into Reading toun longging to the late monasterie
there.  LELAND-E1-P2,109.137

There is no maner of token that ever the toun of Reading was waullid;
LELAND-E1-P2,109.138

yet it is a very auncient toun, and at this tyme the best toun of al
Barkshire.  LELAND-E1-P2,109.139

There was a castelle in the Saxons tyme in this towne:
LELAND-E1-P2,109.140

and the name of Castelle-Streat yet remaynithe, lying from est to west
to passe to Newbyri: LELAND-E1-P2,109.141

but I could not perceive or clerely lerne wher it stoode.
LELAND-E1-P2,109.142

But <P_110> by al lykelihod at the west-ende of the Castelle-Streat:
LELAND-E1-P2,110.143

and, as sum think, about the place of execution.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.144

It is very likely that a peace of the abbay was buildid of the ruines
of it.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.145

Peraventure it stoode wher thabbay was.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.146

S. Edwarde the Martyr's mother-yn-law for penaunce buildid,
as I have redde, a monasterie of nunnes yn Reading.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.147

There is a constant fame that this nunnery was wher S. Maryes,
a paroche chirch is now yn Reading.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.148

King Henry the first making an abbay at Reading of blak monkes
suppressid this house, as I hard, giving the landes thereof to his abbay.
LELAND-E1-P2,110.149

But for more certente know whither the old nunnery stoode not yn the
place wher the abbay of Reading stondith?  And whither S. Maries
were not of a newer foundation?  LELAND-E1-P2,110.150

On the north side of the Castelle-Streat was a late a fair house of
Gray Freres.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.151

In the toune be 3. paroche chirchis.  S. Giles a this
side Kenet ryver: Sainct Maries, and S. Laurence beyond Kenet.
LELAND-E1-P2,110.152

S. Maries is as the principal paroche of the toun for auncientnes
: LELAND-E1-P2,110.153

and standith in the hart of it.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.154

S. Laurence stondith by west hard by cumming yn at the principal
gate of thabbay.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.155

West north west of S. Laurence chirch was an almose house of
poore sisters by al lykelihod of the foundation of sum abbate of Reading:
LELAND-E1-P2,110.156

and remaynid ontyl such tyme one Thorne Abbate of Reading suppressid it
in King Henry the vij. dayes, and gave the landes of it onto the
use of the almoner of his abbay.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.157

But Henry the vij. cumming to Reading, and asking what old house
that was, thabbate told hym, LELAND-E1-P2,110.158

and then the king wyllid hym to convert the house self and the landes
<font> in pios usus.  <$$font> Wherapon thabbate desirid that it might
be made a grammar-schole, LELAND-E1-P2,110.159

and so it was.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.160

One Wylliam Dene, a riche man and servant in thabbay of Reading, gave
200. markes in mony toward the avauncement of this schole: as it
apperith by the epitaphie on his grave in the abbay chirch of Reading.
LELAND-E1-P2,110.161

The ryver of Kenet cummith thorough the midle of Reading toun,
LELAND-E1-P2,110.162

but devidid principally into 2. partes, wherof the principal
streame cummith thorough a great wood bridge in the south side of
the toune.  LELAND-E1-P2,110.163

<P_111>

The arme that breketh out of Kenet is caullid communely about the quarters
of the toune the Halowid brooke, LELAND-E1-P2,111.165

and brekith out of the principal streame of Kenet up above the toune
by west south west aboute the Bere, wher thabbat of Reading had a fair
manor place of bryke, LELAND-E1-P2,111.166

and so cumming doune by medowes ynto Reading toune passith thorough a
peace of thabbay clensing the filth of it, LELAND-E1-P2,111.167

and a litle lower joinith againe with the great streame:
LELAND-E1-P2,111.168

and a litle lower Kenet hole streame goith into Tamise ryver.  So that
Tamise river cummith within half a mile by est north est of Reading.
LELAND-E1-P2,111.169

In the vale of the toune of Reading, wher the 2. armes of Kenet
renne nere togither, I markid diverse armelettes breking out of the
2. streames and making mediamnes, over the which be dyverse
bridges of wood.  LELAND-E1-P2,111.170

And these waters be very commodius for diers, welle occupied there;
LELAND-E1-P2,111.171

for the toune chiefly stondith by clothyng.  LELAND-E1-P2,111.172

From Reading to Causeiham, shortly caullid Causham, aboute half a mile,
wher is a great mayne bridge of tymbre over the Tamise, wher I markid
that it restid most apon fundation of tymbre, and yn sum places of stone.
LELAND-E1-P2,111.173

Toward the north end of this bridge stondith a fair old chapelle of
stone on the right hond, pilid in the fundation for the rage of the
streame of the Tamise.  LELAND-E1-P2,111.174

Ther is no bridge on the Tamise upward betwixt this and Walingford,
distant about a 10. miles of.  LELAND-E1-P2,111.175

LELAND-E1-P2,112.184

Ewelme was the inheritance of the Chaucers.  LELAND-E1-P2,112.185

Thomas Chaucer the last heire male owner of it is buried yn an high
marble tumbe in a fair chapelle in the paroch chirch of Ewelm, on the
southside of the quier with this epitaphie: <font> Hic jacet Thomas
Chaucer armiger, quondam dominus istius villae, & - Patronus istius
ecclesiae: qui obiit <$$font> 18. <font> die mensis Novembr:
anno D. <$$font> 1434. <font> Et Matildis uxor ejus,
quae obiit <$$font> 28. <font> die mensis Aprilis Anno D.
<$$font> 1436.  LELAND-E1-P2,112.186

Sum say, that this Chaucer was a marchant man, and bout a 1000 li.
landes by the yere, and that wollesakkes be yn Ewelm in token of
marchaundise.  LELAND-E1-P2,112.187

And menne say likewise, that he mindid the fundation of the
hospitale of Ewelme, and also the hospitale by Duningtoun-castelle.
LELAND-E1-P2,112.188

But William Duke of $Southfolk did build them booth, eche pore man ther
having xiiij. d. by the weeke.  LELAND-E1-P2,112.189

Alice, doughter and heire to Thomas Chaucer and Matilde, tooke to husband
William de la Pole Duke of Southfolk: the which for love of her and the
commodite of her landes fell much to dwelle yn Oxfordshir and Barkshir
wher his wifes landes lay.  LELAND-E1-P2,112.190

This William translatid and encreasid the manor place of Ewelme.
LELAND-E1-P2,112.191

I think that Ewelme tooke name of a great poole afore the maner place
and elmes grouing about it.  LELAND-E1-P2,112.192

Ewelme paroche chirch a cumly and new peace of work stonding on an
hille was lately made by William Duke of Southfolk and Alice his wife.
LELAND-E1-P2,112.193

William was slayn, LELAND-E1-P2,112.194

and Alice supervivid, LELAND-E1-P2,112.195

and after was byried yn the paroche chirch of Ewelme on the south side

and much after the building of the vicars houses at Windesore yn a circle.
LELAND-E1-P2,113.198

In the midle of the area of the hospitale is a very fair welle.
LELAND-E1-P2,113.199

The master or provost of the almose house hath ther a praty lodging.
LELAND-E1-P2,113.200

every poore man hath 14d. a weke.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.201

I redde these thinges folowing in a table in Ewelm chirch:
LELAND-E1-P2,113.202

Pray for the soules of John Duk of Southfolk, and Elizabeth his wife.
LELAND-E1-P2,113.203

This John was sun and heire to William and Alice.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.204

John de la Pole Duk of Southfolk had by Elizabeth <font> John <$$font>
Erle of Lincoln, Edmund after Duk of Southefolk, Richard, William: and
{COM:blank_in_leland} that was at {COM:sic} scholar yn Gunvile-Haul in
Cambridge, and lyith buried at Baberham.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.205

The maner place of Ewelme is in the valley of the village:
LELAND-E1-P2,113.206

the base court of it is fair, LELAND-E1-P2,113.207

and is buildid of brike and tymbre.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.208

The inner part of the house is sette with in a fair mote,
LELAND-E1-P2,113.209

and is buildid richely of brike and stone.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.210

The haul of it is fair LELAND-E1-P2,113.211

and hath great barres of iren overthuart it instede of crosse beames.
LELAND-E1-P2,113.212

The parler by is exceding fair and lightsum: LELAND-E1-P2,113.213

and so be al the lodginges there.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.214

The commune saying is that Duk John made about the beginning of King
Henry the vij. tymes most of the goodly buildinges withyn the mote.
LELAND-E1-P2,113.215

There is a right fair parke by the manor place.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.216

From Ewelm to Hasely a v. miles by chaumpaine ground sumwhat
plentiful of corne, but most layid to pasturage.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.217

Haseley is thus dividid into Grete-Haseley, Litle Haseley, Lecheford
and Ricote.  LELAND-E1-P2,113.218

Great Haseley was of aunciente tyme a lordship longging by many descentes
to the Pyperdes, whos maner place was <P_114> there wher now is the ferme
place by the chirch longging to Windesor college.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.219

These Piperdes were men of fair possessions, LELAND-E1-P2,114.220

and the name of them as in the principal maner florishid onto Edward the
thirde dayes, about the which tyme Piperdes maner place and the patronage
of the benifice of Haseley was gyven to the college of Windesore.
LELAND-E1-P2,114.221

The armes of Piperd apere yn the est window of the fair chauncelle of
Haseley chirch.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.222

Litle Haseley, wher Master Baretine hath a right fair mansion place, and
marvelus fair walkes <font> topiarii operis <$$font>, and orchardes, and
pooles, holdith, as I lernid, of the maner of Piperdes by knight service.
LELAND-E1-P2,114.223

Lacheforde about the beginning of Edward the $thirde s {TEXT:thirdes}
tyme was parte of the Piperdes landes.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.224

Then it chauncid for a younger sun of Piperdes of Haseley to do so
valiauntly in batelle agayn the Scottes that he was made knight:
LELAND-E1-P2,114.225

and having no lande, bycause that his elder brother was heire, desirid to
have sum smaul portion of land; wherapon his father gave hym Lacheford
to hold by knight service of the maner of Piperdes in Great Haseley.
LELAND-E1-P2,114.226

The stook of this yong Piperd knight remaynid in Lacheford onto 80.
yeres ago: when the last of these Piperdes lefte a doughter and heire ,
that was maried to one Lenthaul, a gentilman of Herefordshir, whos sunne
now dwellith in Lacheforde.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.227

Ricote longid to one Fulco de Ricote.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.228

After it cam to one Quatermains.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.229

The house of the Quatermains in Oxfordshir hath beene famose and of
right fair possessions.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.230

Their chief house was at Weston by Ricote, wher Mr. Clerk now
dwellith.  LELAND-E1-P2,114.231

<P_115>

And Shirburne withyn a mile of Wathelington market, wher is a strong
pile or castelet, longid to Quatremains: sins Fowler: and by exchaunge
now to Chaumbrelein of Oxfordshir.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.233

About King Henry the vj. dayes dyvers brethren dyed of the
Quatremains one after another, LELAND-E1-P2,115.234

and by a great onlykelihod al the landes descendid to one Richard,
the yonggest of the brethern, that was a marchant of London, and after
custumer there.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.235

This Richard had a servant caullid Thomas Fowler, his clerk, a
toward felaw that after was chauncelar of the duchy of Lancastre.
LELAND-E1-P2,115.236

Richard Quatremains bare great favor to this Thomas.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.237

Richard was god-father to Thomas sunne, LELAND-E1-P2,115.238

and namid hym Richard Quatermains Fowler.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.239

Richard Quatermains lay at Ricote: LELAND-E1-P2,115.240

and caussid Thomas Fowler to ly at Westun.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.241

Richard Quatermains made Richard, Thomas Fowler sunne, heir of most part
of his landes, bycause he had no children.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.242

Richard Quatermains godfather to Richard Fowler made a right goodly
large chapelle of ease hard without the manor place of Ricote,
LELAND-E1-P2,115.243

and foundid ther 2. chauntre prestes to sing perpetually for his
soule, enduing the cantuaries with good landes: LELAND-E1-P2,115.244

and made a fair house for the prestes therby.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.245

This fundation was begon in Henry the 6. dayes:
LELAND-E1-P2,115.246

and endid yn Edward the 4. tyme.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.247

This Richard foundid also a cantuarie in Tame paroche chirche a 2.
miles from Ricote, wher he in a chapelle is buried undre a marble stone.
LELAND-E1-P2,115.248

This Richard foundid ther also an hospitale by Tame chirche endowing it
by landes.  LELAND-E1-P2,115.249

Richard Fowler heir to Quatremains was a very onthrift,
LELAND-E1-P2,115.250

and sold al his landes leving his children ful smaul lyvinges.
LELAND-E1-P2,115.251

Syr John Heron, treasorer of the chaumbre to Henry the <P_116> vij.
and the viij. boute the reversion of the lordship of Ricote,
LELAND-E1-P2,116.252

and Giles his sunne possessid it a while.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.253

Giles Heron wise in wordes, but folisch yn deades, as Syr Richard Fowler
was, sold Ricote to John Willyams now knighte.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.254

From Haseley to Miltoun village half a mile.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.255

At this place, as I hard say, was many yeres syns a priorie of monkes:
a selle, as one told me, to Abbingdon.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.256

The house of the priorie was by likelihod wher the farmer's house is
now hard by the chirch yard.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.257

For ther appere fundations of great buildinges.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.258

Sum say that Mounseir de Louches house was wher the farmer's house is.
LELAND-E1-P2,116.259

In the chirch of Miltun is an highe tumbe of fre stone with the image
of a knight and a lady, with an epitaphie in Frenche, declaring that
Richard de Louches chivalier and Helene his wife ly buried there.
LELAND-E1-P2,116.260

The voice ther goith that Louche had the priorie land gyven hym.
LELAND-E1-P2,116.261

Louches landes cam to heires generales.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.262

Of later tymes Davers had this lordship of one {COM:lacuna}.
LELAND-E1-P2,116.263

Syr Regnald Bray boute it of Davers.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.264

The late Lord Bray sold it to Dormer Mair of London.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.265

Ther is a prebend land in Miltun longging to Lincoln.
LELAND-E1-P2,116.266

The Bisshop of Lincoln is patrone of the chirch.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.267

There joynith onto Great-Miltun, Litle-Miltoun, LELAND-E1-P2,116.268

ground fruteful of corne and grasse, but baren of wood as al that angle
of Oxfordshir is, 3. miles.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.270

Here is passid over 3. litle bridges of wood, wher under
wer plaschsy pittes of water of the overflowing of Tame ryver,
LELAND-E1-P2,116.271

and then straite I rode over a great bridge under the which the hole
streame of Tame rennith.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.272

Ther were a 5. great pillers of stone, apon the which was layid
a timbre bridge.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.273

Thens to Drayton village, longging a late to Dorchestre Abbay.
LELAND-E1-P2,116.274

Thens a mile to Dorchester.  LELAND-E1-P2,116.275

<P_117>

In the toun of Dorchestre I markid these notable thinges.
LELAND-E1-P2,117.277

The abbay of chanons, wher afore the Conquest was a bisshopes sete.
LELAND-E1-P2,117.278

Remigius translatid it to Lincoln.  LELAND-E1-P2,117.279

Alexander Bisshop of Lincoln erected there an abbay of blak chanons.
LELAND-E1-P2,117.280

Yet the chirch berith the name of the prebend chirch.
LELAND-E1-P2,117.281

There was buried, as it is said, the bodie of S. Birine bisshop

And there yet remainith the image of free stone that lay on the tumbe of
Bisshop Aeschwine, as apperith by the inscription.  LELAND-E1-P2,117.283

There be buried in the quier beside divers abbates a knight on the south

There lyith a knight on the north side of the quier, a knight whom the
late abbate tooke to be one of the Segraves, LELAND-E1-P2,117.286

But after the abbate told me that he hard of late one say that there

In the body of the chauncelle afore the quier doore lay a gentilman

Ther ly in south isle of the quier 3. of the Draitons, gentilmen,

Mr. Barentine hath part of these Draitons landes.
LELAND-E1-P2,117.291

$Ther lyith at the hed of thes Draitons one Gilbert Segrave a gentilman,
under a flat marble.  LELAND-E1-P2,117.292

The body of the abbay chirch servid a late for the paroche chirch.

Syns the suppression one {COM:lacuna} a great riche man, dwelling in the
toun of Dorchestre, bought the est part of the chirch for 140.
poundes, LELAND-E1-P2,117.294

and gave it to augment the paroch chirch.  LELAND-E1-P2,117.295

The toun of Dorchestre was sore defacid by the Danes.
LELAND-E1-P2,117.296

Of old tyme it was much larger in building then it is now toward the
south and the Tamise side.  LELAND-E1-P2,117.297

There was a paroche chirch a litle by south from the abbay chirch.
And another paroch chirch more south above it.  LELAND-E1-P2,117.298

There was the 3. paroch chirch by south weste.

LELAND-E1-P2,119.321

Ther was a priory of blake monkes, a celle to S. Alban, suppressid

Wallingford.  LELAND-E1-P2,119.322

The toun and the castelle was sore defacid by the Danes warres.

Yet they meatly reflorichid in the tyme of Richard King of Romaines and
Erle of Cornewaulle, brother to King Henry the 3.  LELAND-E1-P2,119.324

This Richard did much cost on the castelle.  LELAND-E1-P2,119.325

The castelle yoinith to the north gate of the toune, LELAND-E1-P2,119.326

and hath 3. dikis, large and deap, and welle waterid.

Mr. Molynes hath a pratie manor place of brike ther.
LELAND-E1-P2,120.339

One Courte buildid this house of late dayes.  LELAND-E1-P2,120.340

This Court was uncle to Molines, that now dwellith at Makeney.
LELAND-E1-P2,120.341

From Sinodune to Abbingdon 6. miles.  LELAND-E1-P2,120.356

A little a this side the bridge over the Ise at Abbingdon is a confluence

The toun of Abbingdon afore the abbay was buildid there was caullid
Seukesham.  LELAND-E1-P2,121.363

The abbay was first begon at Bagley Wood in Barkshir a 2. miles
