M=tr= broks that he is with all is wery of his being ther, which I
persave much discontents my Cosin Adam, MOXINDEN-E2-P2,303.5

and as he saith, meat and drink is not all that he must have,
MOXINDEN-E2-P2,303.6

set him out with these, which he sayth 20 or thirty pound will do, he
will plase him with a Captayne of his aquayntance, to be his Aynshant
