THE DESCRIPTION and vse of the Tables of <font> Tangents and Secants.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.3

<$$heading>

Evclid in the second proposition of his third Booke defineth the line
Tangent in this sort.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.5

A right line <paren> saith he <$$paren> is said to touch a circle when
it toucheth it so as being drawn out in length, it woulde neuer cut the
saide Circle.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.6

The line Secant is not by him any wher defined, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.7

but what these two lines are, you shall better vnderstand by this figure
Demonstratiue here following, then by any definition that can be made
thereof: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.8

for a definition ought to bee plaine and briefe, and not long, intricate
or doubtfull, which will be hardly performed in shewing the nature of
these two lines by way of definition, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.9

and therefore marke well this figure following.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.10

{COM:figure_omitted} In this figure you see first a Circle drawne vpon
the Centre <font> C. <$$font> from which Centre is extended to the
circumference of the Circle a right line, called the Semidiameter , marked
with the letters <font> A. C. <$$font> BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.11

then there is another right line which toucheth the said Circle, and
also the outermost end of the said Semi-diameter making therewith a
right Angle in the point <font> A. <$$font> and is called the
line Tangent BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57R.12

then ther is a third line which proceeding from the Centre <font>
C. <$$font> doth cut the circumference of the Circle in the
point <font> B. <$$font> & also meeteth with the line Tangent
in the point <font> D <$$font> and therfore is called y=e= line Secant,
betweene which two lines, I meane the Tangent & Secant, is intercepted
or included a certaine portion <P_57V> or arch of the foresaid Circle,
lesse then a Quadrant marked with the letters <font> A. B.
<$$font> of which Arke the line <font> A. D. <$$font>
is the Tangent, and the line <font> C. D. <$$font> is the
Secant thereof, which must needes meete with the Tangent in the point
<font> D. <$$font> because that the two Angles <font> C.
A. D <$$font>, and <font> D. C. A. <$$font>
are lesser then two right Angles, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.13

for the one is right, and the other sharpe, by reason that the Arke is
lesse then a Quadrant.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.14

And some doe call the line Tangent the line <font> Ascript <$$font>,
because it is ascribed to the Circle, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.15

and they call the line Secant the <font> Hipothenuse <$$font>, because it
subtendeth the right Angle <font> A. <$$font> BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.16

& they call the Semidiameter or totall Sine, the base of y=e= rectangle
Triangle <font> C. A. D. <$$font> which is called
a rectangle Triangle because it contayneth one right Angle marked with
the letter <font> A. <$$font> BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.17

and note that when soeuer any maner of Angle is propounded by three
letters, that the middle letter doth alwayes signifie the Angle
propounded, be it right, sharpe, or blunt.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.18

Now if you would know to what ende the foresaid two lines were inuented,
and wherto they serue you have to vnderstand that they chiefly serue in
calculating the quantitie of Angles and their sides, as well in right
lined Triangles as in sphericall Triangles, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.19

for the sides of Triangles are either right or crooked,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.20

and if they haue right sides, such Triangles are eyther right angled
Triangles, or oblique angled Triangles, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.21

and you haue to note that the quantitie of euery Angle is to be measured
by the arch of a Circle subtending that angle, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.22

for the point of every Angle is imagined to be the Centre of a whole
Circle, which you may suppose to bee so great or little as you will,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.23

for euery Circle <paren> bee it great or little <$$paren> is deuided
into 360. degrees, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.24

and looke how many degrees and minutes the arch subtending that Angle
containeth, so much is the quantitie of that Angle, the practise whereof
is very wel set downe by <font> Clauius <$$font> in his commentaries vpon
<font> Theodosius <$$font>, which I minde <paren> God willing <$$paren>
hereafter to translate into our mother tongue: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.25

In the meane time my intention here, is onely to shew you by one example
or two, the vse of the Tables made for the foresaid lines Tangent
and Secant.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.26

<heading>

The vse of the said Tables according to Clauius, is thus.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,57V.28

<$$heading>

In seeking out the Tangent or Secant of any Arke giuen, or of the
complement of any Arke by either of these Tables, you haue <P_58R> to
obserue the selfe same order which you did before in finding out the
right Sine of any Arke giuen, or of the complement of any Arke, <font>
Per tabulas sinuum <$$font>.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.30

As for example, if you would finde out the Tangent of an Arke containing
50. degrees, 2'4. then resort to the Table of Tangents in
the front, wherof looke first for the Arke 50. degrees, and then
in the first collum on the left hand of the said table, for 2'4.
right against which on the right hand vnder the Arke 50. you
shall finde in the common Angle the Tangent to bee 12$$087$$923.
the total Sine wherof is 10$$000$$000. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.31

but if you would find out the Secant of the foresaid Arke 50.
and 2'4. then you must resort to the table of Secants,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.32

and hauing found out the Arke 50, in the front of the said Tables,
and the 2'4. on the left hand as before, you shall find in the
commen Angle the Secant to be 15688144.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.33

And if you would haue the Tangent of the complement of the said Arke which
is 39. degrees, and 3'6. you shall find the 39.
degrees of the complement in the foot of the table of Tangents right
vnder the Arke 50. & the 3'6. in the outermost collum on
the right hand of the said table, with which complement you must enter
the table of Tangents, seeking for 39. degrees in the front of
the table, and 3'6. in the first collum on the left hand of the
said table, right against which in the common Angle you shall finde
8272720. to be the Tangent of 39. degrees 3'6.
which is the complement of 50 degrees, 2'4.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.34

And you must worke in like manner with the table of Secants:
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.35

As for example, if you would find the Secant of 72. degrees, 3'6.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.36

first then enter the table of Secants, looking for 72. degrees
aboue in the front of the table, and 36. in the first collum on
the left hand of the said table, and in the common Angle you shall find
33$$440$$240. which is the Secant of 72. degrees, 3'6.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.37

But if you would haue the Secant of the complement of the said arch
72. degrees, 3'6. then looking in the foote of the Table
right vnder 72. degrees, you shall finde 17. degrees,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.38

and in the outermost collum on the right hand, iust against 3'6.
you shall find 2'4. so as you see that 17. degrees
2'4. is the complement of 72. degrees, 3'6.
with which complement you must enter the Table of Secants, looking
for 17. degrees, aboue in the front of the Table, and for
2'4. in the first collum on the left hand of the said tables,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58R.39

& in the common Angle you shall find 10$$479$$542. to bee the
Secant of the arch 17. <P_58V> degrees, 2'4. which is the
complement of the arch 72. degrees 3'6.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.40

The vse of which tables in Astronomical matters, I haue here set <font>
downe as followeth <$$font>.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.42

1 BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.43

To finde out the declination of the Sunne, the place thereof being knowne.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.44

<$$heading>

Multiply the Secant of the complement of the greater declination by the
totall sine, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.46

& deuide the product by the sine of the Suns distance fro~ one of
the Equinoctial points, the quotient is the Secant of an arch, whose
complement is the declination of the Sun; BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.47

for example, suppose that the sunne be entering into {COM:symbol_omitted}
.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.48

to find the declination thereof, first I multiply 25112030.
the Secant of 66. degrees 3'2..  <paren> which is the
complement of 23. degrees 2'8. the greatest declination
<$$paren> by 10000000. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.49

the product is 251120300000000. which being diuided by
5000000. <paren> the sine of 30. degrees the Sunnes distance
from the Equinoctiall point <$$paren> the quotient is 50224060.
for which number I seeke in the Table of Secants, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.50

the arch answering vnto it is 78. degr. 3'2.
the complement wherof is 11. degrees 2'9. which is the
declination of the Sunne.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.51

<heading>

2 Knowing the declination of the Sunne how to finde his distance from
the Equinoctiall point, and so consequently his place in the Zodiacke.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.53

<$$heading>

Multiply the Secant of the complement of the greatest declination by
the totall sine BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.55

& deuide the product by the Secant of the complement of the declination
giuen, the quotient is the distance of the Sun from the Equinoctiall
point.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.56

As for example, the declination of the sun is supposed to be 11.
degrees 2'9. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,58V.57

then to <P_59R> find his distance from the Equinoctiall, I multiply
25112030. the Secant of 66. degrees 3'2..  <paren>
which is the complement of the greatest declination <$$paren> by the
totall sine BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.58

the product is 251120300000000. which I diuide by 50224350.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.59

the Secant is 78. degr. 3'1.  the complement of 11.
degrees 2'9. the supposed declination, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.60

the quotient is 5000000. the sine whereof is 30. degrees
{COM:symbol_omitted} which is the distance of the Sunne from the
Equinoctiall: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.61

then for his place you must take the same according to the season of
the yeare: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.62

for if it be in Aprill, then the Sunne is entring into <font> Taurus
<$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.63

but if it be in August it is entering into <font> Virgo <$$font>,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.64

and being in October, it is entring into <font> Scorpio <$$font>,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.65

and being in Februarie it is in the beginning of <font> Pisces <$$font>.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.66

<heading>

3 To find out the right ascention of the Sunne.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.68

<$$heading>

Multiply the Tangent of the distance of the Sunne from the Equinoctiall
point which is nearest vnto it, by the signe of the complement of the
greatest declination, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.70

and diuide the product by the total signe, the quotient is the Tangent of
the right ascention of the Sunne, for which if you seeke in the Table of
Tangents, the arch answering vnto it is your desire: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.71

For example the Sunne being in the first of <font> Taurus <$$font>, to
knowe the right ascention thereof, I multiply 5773502. the Tangent
of 30. degrees <paren> for that 30. degrees is the distance
of the Sun from the Equinoctiall point <$$paren> by 9172920. the
sine of 66. degrees 3'2. which is the complement of 23
degrees 2'8. the greatest declination.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.72

the product is 52959871965840. which being deuided by
10000000. the totall sine, the quotient is 5295987. which
is the Tangent of 27. degrees, 5'4. which is the right
ascention of the Sunne beeing entered into <font> Taurus <$$font>.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.73

<heading>

4 How to find out the declination of the Sunne knowing onely the right
ascention thereof.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.75

<$$heading>

Multiply the Tangent of the complement of the greatest declination by
the total sine, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.77

and diuide the product by the sine of the right ascention giuen, the
quotient is the Tangent of the complement of the Sunnes declination:
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59R.78

for example the right ascention <P_59V> of the Sunne being
27. degrees 5'4. I would know the declination thereof,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.79

multiplying 23035062. the Tangent of 66. degrees 3'2.
the complement of 23. degrees 2'8. by 10000000. the
product is 230370620000000. which being deuided by 4679298.
the sine of the giuen ascention the quotient is 49224856.
the arch of which Tangent is 78. degrees 3'2. which
being subducted out of 90. the remainder is 11. degrees
2'8. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.80

and so much is the declination of the Sunne.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.81

<heading>

5 How to finde the place of the Sunne knowing onely the right ascention
thereof.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.83

<$$heading>

Subduct the right ascention giuen out of 90. if it be lesse then
90 BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.85

but if the same bee more then 90. subtract the ascention giuen
out of 180. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.86

and being greater then 180. subduct the same from 30.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.87

and multiply the Tangent of the remainder by the sine of the complement
of the greatest declination, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.88

and deuide the product by the totall sine, the quotient is the Tangent of
the complement of the Suns distance from one of the Equinoctiall points:
which distance being knowne, the place of the Sunne can $now {TEXT:not}
be knowne.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.89

For example, supposing the right ascention of the Sun to be 27.
degrees 5'4. the complement thereof is 62. degrees
6'. the Tangent wherof is 18886715. which being multiplyed
by 9172920. the product is 173245985757800. which being
deuided by 10000000 the quotient is 17324598. for which I looke
in the table of Tangents, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.90

and I finde the arch thereof to be 60. the complement wherof is
30. which is the distance of the Sunne from the Equinoctiall point
, that is, from <font> Aries <$$font>, for that the right ascention is
lesse then 90. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.91

I say then that the Sunne is in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font>.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.92

But if the right ascention had beene more then 90, and lesse then
180. the place of the Sunne had beene betwixt <font> Cancer
<$$font> and <font> Libra <$$font> 30. degrees from <font> Libra
<$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.93

so should it haue been in the first point of <font> Virgo <$$font>,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.94

but if the right ascention had beene more then 180. the place of
the Sunne should be betwixt <font> Libra <$$font> and <font> Capricorne
<$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.95

that is in the beginning of <font> Scorpio <$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.96

but being more then 270. the place of the Sun should be betwixt
<font> Capricorne <$$font> and <font> Aries <$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.97

that is in the beginning of <font> Pisces <$$font>.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,59V.98

6 To find out the ascentionall difference of the Sunne or any starre in
the firmament, knowing the declination thereof, and also the Latitude
of your Region.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.101

<$$heading>

Multiply the Tangent of the declination of the sunne or star by the
Tangent of the Latitude of the place, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.103

and deuide the product by the totall sine: the sine of the quotient
is the signe of the ascentionall difference, the arch whereof is the
desired ascentional difference.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.104

For example let the declination of the Sunne starre or other point
in the firmament be 10. degrees 3'. and suppose the
latitude to be 52. degrees, the Tangent of 10. degrees
3. is 1772268. the Tangent of 52. degrees is
12799416. which being multiplyed together, the product will be
2267$$4995$$395488. which being deuided by 10000000. the
totall sine, the quotient is 2267499. for which number I looke
amongst the sines, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.105

the arch answering thereunto is 13. degrees 6'.  which is the
ascentionall difference desired.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.106

<heading>

7 To find out the oblique ascention of the Sunne.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.108

<$$heading>

Knowing the place of the Sunne, find out the right ascention of the same
by the third proposition, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.110

and find also the ascentional difference of the same point,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.111

then if the declination of the Sun be North, subduct the ascentional
difference out of the right ascention, the remainder is the oblique
ascention.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.112

For example, suppose the Sunne to be in the beginning of <font> Taurus
<$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.113

now to finde the oblique ascention thereof in the Latitude of 52.
degrees, first by the third proposition I find out the right ascention of
the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font>, which I find to be 27.
degrees 5'4. <paren> for that the declination is North <$$paren>
the right ascention BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.114

the remainder is 12. degrees 5'0.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.115

& so much is the oblique ascention for the latitude of 52. degrees.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.116

But if the Sunne be in any of the Southern sines and that the declination
be South, then the ascentionall difference is to be added vnto the right
ascention before giuen.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60R.117

<P_60V>

<heading>

8 To finde out the oblique descention of the Sunne at any time.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.120

<$$heading>

First find out the right ascention of the Sunne by the third proposition,
the same shall bee the right descention thereof, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.122

then finde the ascentionall difference by the sixt proposition,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.123

and if the Sun be in any of the Northerne signes, adde the ascentional
difference vnto the right ascention, the summe shall be the oblique
descention of the Sunne: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.124

but if it be in any of the Southerne signes, subduct the ascentionall
difference out of the right ascention, the remainder is the desired
descention: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.125

as for example the sunne being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font>
, the right ascention thereof by the third proposition is 27.
degrees 5'4. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.126

the ascentionall difference thereof by the sixth proposition is 15.
degrees 4'. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.127

for as much then as <font> Taurus <$$font> is a Northerne signe
, I adde the ascentionall difference vnto the right ascention,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.128

the summe is 24. degrees 5'8. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.129

& so much is the oblique descention of the Sunne being in the beginning
of <font> Taurus <$$font>.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.130

<heading>

9 To find out the length of the day or night.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.132

<$$heading>

Hauing found out the ascentionall difference by the sixth proposition,
adde the same vnto 90. if the sunne be in any of the Northerne
signes, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.134

but if it be in any of the Southerne signes, subduct the ascentionall
difference out of 90. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.135

then diuide the summe of the addition or the remainder of the subtraction
by 15. the quotient will shew the halfe length of the day in
houres and minutes, which being doubled you shall haue the whole length
of the artificiall day.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.136

For example the Sunne being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font> ,
the ascentionall difference thereof is 15. degrees 4'. which
for the summe is 105. degrees 4'. which being deuided by
15. the quotient is 7. houres 0'. the halfe length
of the day which being doubled will be 14. houres the whole
length of the artificiall day in the Latitude of 52. degrees.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.137

<heading>

10 To finde the houre OF the Sunne his rising or setting in any Latitude
assigned.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.139

<$$heading>

First find out the halfe length of the artificiall day by the 9.
proposition, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,60V.141

and subtract the same from 12. houres, the remainder <P_61R>
will shew the houre of the sunnes rising, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.142

for example the Sun being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font>
to know the houre of his rising in the Latitude of 52. degrees,
by the ninth proposition, the halfe length of the artificiall day I
finde to bee 7. houres, which I subtract from 12. houres
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.143

the remainder is 5. which sheweth that the Sun riseth at 5.
of the clocke in the Morning BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.144

but the halfe length of the day it selfe is the houre of the Sunnes
setting.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.145

<heading>

11 To find out the length of the planetarie houres and to find what
Planet raigneth at any houre of the day.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.147

<$$heading>

First find out the length of the artificiall day by the ninth proposition
, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.149

and diuide the same by 12. the quotient is the length of one
planetarie houre: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.150

or thus, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.151

hauing an houre of the artificial day giuen, looke what houre the same
is from the Sunne rysing, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.152

and multiply the same by 12. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.153

diuide the product by the length of the artificiall day, the quotient
is the number of the Planetarie houre.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.154

For example the sunne being in the beginning of <font> Taurus <$$font>,
and our Latitude being 52. degrees, the length of the artificial
day by the ninth proposition is 14. houres: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.155

then doe I deuide 14. by 12. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.156

the quotient is 1$$1$$4. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.157

that is 1. houre 1'0.  the length of one Planetarie houre.

But if an houre of the artificiall day be giuen as that I would know what
Planetarie houre it is at 9. of the clocke the Sunne being in the
first of <font> Taurus <$$font> in the Latitude of 52. degrees,
hauing found that the Sunne riseth at fiue of the clocke by the tenth
proposition, I see that 4. houres of the artificiall day are gone
at nine of the clocke, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.159

I therefore multiply 12. by 4. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.160

the product is 48. which I diuide by 14. the length of
the artificiall day, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.161

the quotient is 3$$1$$7. which is the Planetarie houre at the

likewise shall you find the Planetarie houre of the night, finding the
length thereof, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.163

and then worke with it as was shewed before for the day.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61R.164

Now to know what Planet raigneth at any houre of the day or night is

Multiply the Sine of the complement of your Latitude by the Tangent
of the distance of the giuen Circle of position from the Zenith,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.170

& diuide the product by the totall Sine, the quotient is the Tangent
of the arch of the Equinoctial, which is comprehended betwixt the giuen
Circle of position, and the Meridian.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.171

For example in the Latitude of 52. I would knowe what part
of the Equinoctiall is comprehended betwixt the Meridian and that
Circle of position, which is 30. degrees from the Zenith:
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.172

the Latitude being 52. degrees, the complement thereof is
38. degrees, the Sine whereof is 6156615, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.173

and the Tangent of 30. degrees, <paren> for that 30. is the
distance betwixt the giuen Circle of position and the Zenith <$$paren>
is 5773502. which being multiplyed by 6156615. the product
is 35545229015730. which being diuided by 10000000. the
totall Sine, the quotient is 3554522. for which I seeke among
the Tangents, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.174

and I finde the Arke aunswering thereunto.  to be 19. degrees
3'4. the Arch of the Equinoctiall, betwixt the Meridian and the

13 Knowing the Latitude of your Region, and also the Eleuation of the

said Circle of position vnto the Meridian, and so consequently the Arch
of the Equinoctiall, which is betwixt the said Circle of position and
the Meridian.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.177

<$$heading>

Multiply the Secant of the complement of the eleuation of the Pole aboue
the Circle of position by the Sine of your Latitude, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.179

and diuide the product by the total Sine, the quotient is the Secant
of the complement of the inclination of the circle of position vnto the
Meridian, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.180

and that is the distance betwixt the Circle of Position and the Zenith,
by helpe whereof you shall find the Arch of the Equinoctiall, betwixt
the Circle of Position and the Meridian, as in the former proposition.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.181

As for example, suppose the eleuation of the Pole aboue the Circle of
position, in our Latitude of 52. to be 23. degrees 1'2.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,61V.182

Now to find out the Inclination <P_62R> of that Circle of Position vnto
the Meridian, first I multiply 25384445. the Secant of 66.
degrees 4'8..  <paren> for that is the complement of 23.
degrees 1'2.  the eleuation of the Pole aboue the Circle of position
<$$paren> by 7880108 the Sine of 52. the Latitude of our Region,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.183

the product is 200032168120060. which being diuided by
10000000. the quotient is 20003216. for which I looke in
the Table of Secants, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.184

and the Arch thereof is 60. degrees 0'.  the complement whereof
is 30. degrees 0'. which is the Inclination of the Circle
of position vnto the Meridian, or the distance of the Zenith from the
said Circle, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.185

then to finde the Arch of the Equinoctiall betwixt the said Circle of
Position and the Meridian, repeate the worke of the former proposition.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.186

<heading>

14 To find out the Eleuation of the Pole aboue any assigned Circle of
Position in any giuen Latitude.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.188

<$$heading>

Knowing the Inclination of the assigned Circle of Position vnto the
Meridian, Multiply the Secant of the complement thereof by the totall
Sine, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.190

and diuide the product by the Sine of your Latitude, the quotient is the
Secant of the complement of the Eleuation of the Pole aboue the giuen
Circle of Position: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.191

as for example, suppose the inclination of a Circle of position to bee
30. degrees 0'. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.192

Now to finde the eleuation of the Pole aboue the same for the Latitude
of 52. degrees 0'. First take the complement of 30.
degrees 0'. which is 60. degrees 0'. the Secant
whereof is 20000000. which being multiplyed by the totall
Sine the product is 200000000000000. which being diuided
by 7880108. the Sine of 52. the assigned Latitude the
quotient is 25$$80362. for which I seeke in the Table of Secants
, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.193

and the Arch answering thereunto I find to be 66. degrees
4'8. the complement whereof is, 23. degrees 1'2.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.194

and so much is the Eleuation of the Pole aboue the assigned Circle of
Position in your Latitude.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.195

Thus much touching the vse of the Tables of Sines, Tangents and Secants
, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,62R.196

<$$heading>

<heading>

<font> What be Colures?  <$$font> BLUNDEV-E2-P2,150V.208

<$$heading>

They bee great mooueable circles passing through both the Poles of the
world, which the Astronomers do otherwise call Circles of declination
, whereof they make 180. which are halfe so many as there $bee
{TEXT:vee} degrees in the Equinoctiall, applying them to diuers vses
not needfull here to be rehearsed, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,150V.210

for sith that there are but 2. Colures accustomably set
down in the Spheare, without the which a materiall Spheare $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be made, I minde heere therefore onely to treate of them.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,150V.211

<font> Shew first what this name Colure signifieth.  <$$font>
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,150V.212

This word Colure beeing compounded of <font> Colos <$$font> and <font>
Oura <$$font>, <P_151R> is as much to say as vnperfect or maymed, the
taile being cut off, because none of these Circles are euer seene whole
aboue our Horizon, but parte thereof, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.213

for some part is alwayes seene, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.214

and some part is alwaies hidden, as that part which is aboue the Horizon
, and nigh vnto the Pole, is alwaies seene, because it neuer goeth downe
under the Horizon: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.215

likewise that which is nigh vnto the South pole is alwaies hidden from
vs , because it neuer riseth aboue our Horizon, as by turning the Spheare
about, you may easilie perceiue the same.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.216

<heading>

<font> Which be those Colures that are commonly set downe in the Spheare
, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.218

and how are they named?  <$$font> BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.219

<$$heading>

They are two great mooueable circles, passing through the Poles of the
world, crossing one another in the said Poles with right Sphearicall
angles, by meanes whereof they deuide the whole Spheare into foure
equall partes, of which two Colures the one is called the Colure of the
Equinoxes, and the other the Colure of Solstices.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.221

<font> Describe these two Circles, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.222

& shew why they are so named?  <$$font> BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.223

The Colure of the Equinoxes is so called because it cutteth the Zodiaque
in the beginning of <font> Aries <$$font>, which is called the vernal
Equinoxe: and also in the beginning of <font> Libra <$$font>, which is
called the Autumnall Equinoxe, at which two times the daies and nightes
be equall, as hath been said before when we did speake of the Equinoctiall
circle, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.224

and this circle deuideth the Ecliptique into two halfes, the one <font>
Septentrionall <$$font>, and the other <font> Meridionall <$$font>
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.225

and thereby sheweth the signes wherein the Sunne maketh the dayes longer
and shorter than the nights, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.226

for whilest he is in the 6. Northern signes, he maketh the daies
with vs longer then the nights, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.227

and when he is in the 6. Southern signes he maketh the nightes
longer then the daies: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.228

now you haue to vnderstand that the Colure of the Solstice, is so
called because it cutteth the Zodiaque in the two Solstitiall points,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.229

that is to say, in the beginning of <font> Cancer <$$font>, and the
beginning of <font> Capricorne <$$font>, as you may see in beholding
and turning the Spheare about with your hand.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.230

<heading>

<font> Why are these two points called Solstitiall?  <$$font>
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.232

<$$heading>

They take their name of these two Latine words <font> Sol <$$font>
and <font> statio <$$font>, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.234

that is to say, the Sun and standing, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.235

for when the Sunne is in any of the two points, hee seemeth to stand
still, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151R.236

or at the least <P_151V> mooueth so little, as his proper moouing from
West to East $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be easily perceiued, during the
space of twelue dayes.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.237

And you haue to note, that when the Sunne entereth into the first degree
of <font> Cancer <$$font>, which is about the 22. of Iune, then hee
is at the highest, and the dayes be at the longest, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.238

and therefore, it is called the Summer Solstice.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.239

Againe, when hee entereth into the first degree of <font> Capricorne
<$$font>, which is about the 12. of December, then the Sunne is
at the lowest, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.240

and the nights are at the longest, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.241

& therefore it is called the Winter Solstice.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.242

And in this Colure there are set downe the two Poles of the Ecliptique
line being distant from the Poles of the world 23. degrees and
2'8. BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.243

Moreouer on this Colure is measured the greatest declination of y=e=
Sun, which is alwayes equall to the distaunce of the Pole of the
Ecliptique, from the Pole of the world, as hath been said before.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.244

And you haue to note that the 4. former points, that is to say ,
the 2. Equinoxes, and the 2. Solstices, are commonly called
the foure cardinall or principall pointes, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.245

and of some they are called, the foure pointes of Change, signifying
the 4. beginnings of the foure diuers seasons of the yeare:
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.246

for betwixt the beginning of <font> Aries <$$font> and beginning of <font>
Cancer <$$font>, is contained the Spring time, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.247

and betwixt the beginning of <font> Cancer <$$font> and the beginning
of <font> Libra <$$font>, is the summer time: BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.248

and from the beginning of <font> Libra <$$font> to the beginning of <font>
Capricorne <$$font> is the time called Autumne, or fall of the leafe:
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.249

and from the beginning of <font> Capriconre <$$font> to the beginning of
<font> Aries <$$font> is contayned the winter season, albeit the Sunne
entreth not into any of these signes alwayes at one selfe day or time
of the yeare, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.250

for at Christ his incarnation, the Sunne entred into <font> Aries <$$font>
the 25. of March, and into <font> Cancer <$$font> the 24.
of Iune, and into <font> Libra <$$font> the 27. of September,
and into <font> Capricorne <$$font> the 25. of December , which
was then the shortest day in the yeare, and the beginning of Winter,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.251

and therefore is called of the Latines, <font> dies brumalis <$$font>
, on which day Christ our Sauiour was borne, so as from the time of his
birth vnto this present yeare, there are runne almost 13. dayes,
wherefore, vnlesse the Kalenders bee reformed as well heere in <font>
England <$$font> as elsewhere <paren> for the Romane reformation is not so
exactly true as it might bee <$$paren> wee shall haue in processe of time,
the Spring in Winter, and the Winter in Autumne.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,151V.252

<font> How shall I know this present year, or any yeare to come hereafter
, at what day and houre the Sunne entereth into any of the 12.

<$$heading>

First you must learne by some good Ephemerides, or other Table, the
true entrance of the Sun into euery signe in any yeare passed before,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,152R.257

then from the time of the entrance of the Sunne into the signe which
you desire to know, consider how many yeares are betwixt, and how many
leape yeares are in the same contained, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,152R.258

and substract for so many times as there be leape yeares, 4'4.,

and ad to the houres remaining, so many times fiue houres, and 4'9.

And first of their substance, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,158V_misnumbered_as_157V.266

and then of their moouing, figure, shape, number, magnitude or greatnes,
also of their Longitude, <P_159R_misnumbered_as_158R> Latitude,
declination, ascention, descention both right and oblique, and of the
ascentionall difference, and finally of the threefold Poeticall rising

BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.270

The stars be of the same substance that {of} the heauens are
wherein they are placed, differing onely from the same in thicknes,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.272

and therefore some defining a starre doe say, that it is a
bright and shining body, and the thickest part of his heauen
, apt both to receiue and to reteine the light of the Sunne,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.273

and therby is visible and obiect to the sight:
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.274

for the heauen it selfe being most pure, thinne, transparent, and without
colour is not visible, BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159R_misnumbered_as_158R.275

and for this cause the milke-white impression in heauen like vnto
a white way called of the Astronomers <font> Galaxia <$$font>,
and of the common people our Ladies way, is visible to the eye,
by reason that it is thicker then anie other part of the heauen.

Some say that the first mooueable is turned by God himselfe, and
all the rest of the heauens euery one by his proper intelligence,
which though it turneth his heauen about, yet it giueth neither
life, sense, nor vnderstanding thereunto, as some haue vntruely

All the fixed starres of the firmament are alwayes of like distance,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.297

notwithstanding by reason of the manyfold moouing of the firmament,
wherein they are placed, they seeme to change their places, and
sometimes to bee more towardes the East or West, North or South.
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.298

And whereas the vii. Planets called the wandring starres, doe

BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.299

for a starre being round of shape hath no members meete to walke from

notwithstanding the Astronomers by their industrie and diligent

the seuen Planetes, otherwise called the wandringe starres, and haue made
manifest demonstrations of their motions, and by continuall obseruation
haue found out the manifolde vertues, powers and influences of the same,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.310

but of the fixed starres they could neuer finde more then 1022,
BLUNDEV-E2-P2,159V_misnumbered_as_158V.311

and because the starres are not equall in greatnes or bignesse
, they make sixe differences of greatnesse, appointing to the
first difference 15. starres, which are bigger then all
the rest, whereof euerie one containeth the earth 207.
times, to the seconde difference 45. starres, whereof
<P_160R_misnumbered_as_157R> euery one containeth the earth 90.

To the fift they assigne 217. starres, whereof euery one containeth
the earth 57. times.  BLUNDEV-E2-P2,160R_misnumbered_as_157R.315

To the sixt or last greatnesse they appoint 49. small
