THE THIRDE BOKE.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.3

<$$heading>

BOECIUS.  Nowe when Phylosophy had ended her songe, and that the swetenes
of her metyr had confyrmyd me beynge desyrous to heare wyth open eares,
and meruaylynge at her wordes I <paren> a lytle after <$$paren> sayde.
O phylosophye, whych art the very comforte of werye myndes, howe much
haste thou cheryshed me with the grauitie of thy sentences, and with the
pleasauntenes of thy syngynge.  In so much that I do thinke that fro~
henceforth, I am able to wythstand the assaultes of fortune.  Soo that
the medycines that thou a lytell before saydest were very sharpe ,
I do not onelye nothyng feare, but I beyng very desyrous to here them,
do vehemently or ernestlye often requyre them.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.5

PHIL: I well perceyued the same, when thou being styll makynge no noyse
and herkenyng, receyuydest my wordes.  And that I had expected or reuocate
the habite of thy mynde, that thou hast now, <paren> or that is more
true <$$paren> that I had perfyted the habite or maner of thy mynde.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.6

And certes the residue of the thinges that do remayne be suche, that when
they be tasted, truely they do byte or be vnplesaunte.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.7

But when they be receyued inwardly: they taste swetely.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.8

But for by cause thou sayest thou art so desyrous to here them, Oh howe
muche wouldyste thou brene with desyre, yf thou knewest whether I wold
lede the.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.9

BOE: I saye, whyther wouldyste thou leade me.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.10

PHIL: To the trewe felycitie, that thy mynde dreameth of.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.11

But thy syghte beyng occupyed with fantasies and immagynations, that is
to saye: with temporall or worldely thynges: thou mayst not beholde and
loke vpon the same true and perfyt felycitie.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,53.12

<P_54>

BOE: Then come of BOETHCO-E1-P2,54.14

and shewe me I beseche the, without anye taryinge, whyche is the same
trewe felicitie.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,54.15

PHIL: I wyll doo it gladelye at thy request, BOETHCO-E1-P2,54.16

but fyrst I wil go about to mark and appoynte out by my wordes, that
false felycytie, that is better knowen to the, that after thou haste
sene her, when thou hast turnyd thy eyes on the contrarye parte, that
is to saye: from false felicitie vnto trewe felicitie, thou mayst the
better knowe the similytude and beawtie of the same trew felicitie.
{COM:material_omitted} BOETHCO-E1-P2,54.17

<P_54>

BOECIUS.  Then Phylosophy lokynge donnewarde a litle, and remembrynge her
selfe as one that had her wits to seke, or put vp into the narow seate
of her mynd, beganne to speake after thys maner.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,54.19

P. All y=e= cure of mortal folk howe manye maners of wayes soeuer
they do labour and trauell, yet they all do laboure <paren> althoughe
it be by dyuers and sondry meanes <$$paren> to come vnto one ende of
felycitie, or blessednes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,54.20

Truely that thynge is good <paren> whyche when a man hath obteyned it
<$$paren> that nothynge can be desyred ferther besydes it, which thinge
certes is the soueraygne good of all thynges, and contayneth in it
selfe all good thynges.  <P_55> To the whych good thynge yf any thinge
shoulde be awaye or wantynge: it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be sufferaigne
and perfyt good, for by cause som thing is left behynd or forgotte~
that maye be desyred.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.21

Therefore it appereth $y=t= felicitie is a perfyt state by gatheryng
together of all good thynges.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.22

The same perfytte state, or felicitie <paren> as I haue sayde
<$$paren> al me~ lyuynge do labor to optayne and gette dyuers wayes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.23

For the desyre of felycitye or blessednes, is naturally plantyd in mens
myndes and hartes, but that wandryng error ledyth them out of the way
to false gods, that is to say: worldlye thynges, of the whyche men,
some <paren> certes thynkyng that the perfytte felycitie and goodnes is
to haue nede of nothynge <$$paren> doo laboure to habounde in ryches.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.24

Other men <paren> iudging good that thyng, that is most worthy honour
<$$paren> do stryue to be honorable emongest their citizens and neyghbours
after they haue gotten honors.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.25

There be other that do $determyne {TEXT:dertermyne} that soueraygne
felycitye is in high power, BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.26

and they them self will raygne or rule, BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.27

or do laboure to be nere vnto suche as doo rule or raygne.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.28

But other to whome fame semeth perfytte felycitie and goodnes, do make
haste to optayne a gloryous name by feates of warre or armes, or by the
meanes of peace makyng.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.29

But many do measure the fruyte of perfytte felicitie, wythe myrth and
gladnes, BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.30

that is to saye: doo thynke that perfytte felicitie standythe in ioye
and gladnes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.31

They do thynke it the most perfytte felicitie, to haue abou~dau~ce of
corporal pleasure.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.32

Also ther be some men that do chaunge or ioine the endes and causes of
thynges one wyth another, as they that do desyre to haue ryches, for to
haue power and pleasure BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.33

or they desyre power bycause they wold haue monye or fame and renoune.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.34

Soo in these thinges and suche lyke, the intente and purpose of all mens
actes, and desyres be occupied: as noblenes and fauoure of the common
people whych semeth to geue vnto all men a certayne glory and prayse.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.35

And lykewyse wife and chyldren, that men desyre for the cause of pleasure
and myrth.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.36

But frendes which is the most holy thyng, may not be acountyd emonges
the goods of fortune, <paren> whych consysteth in wordly and tra~sytory
thynges <$$paren> but in vertu.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.37

But al the other thinges that cometh of fortune, be taken eyther
for the loue of offyce or power, or of pleasure, and delyghte.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,55.38

And truely it is mete to referre al goodes temporall, and transytorye,
vnto y=e= other goodes of fortune, <P_56> abouenamed.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.39

For strength and gretnes of bodye semeth to geue powre: fayrenes
and swyftnes, to geue glory and prayse: and helthe of bodye, to geue
pleasure, and delyght.  In all whych thynges it apperyth that blessednes
and felicytye is desyred.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.40

For that thynge that anye man requyreth or desyreth aboue all other
thynges, the same he iudgeth to be soueraygne good or felicitie.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.41

But I haue dyffyned that soueraygne good is perfyt felycitie.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.42

For euerye man demeth that state to be blessed, that he desireth aboue
other thynges.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.43

Therefore thou hast before thine eyes shewed and declared the proposed
fortune and maner of mannes felicitie, that is ryches, power, honour ,
glorye and plesures, which thynges truelye the Epicurus onelye considering
and beholding, estemid co~sequentlye with hymselfe, that plesure was
soueraygne good or perfyt felycitie, forsomuch as all the other thinges
semyd to reioyse the harte and mynde, but none so much as plesure,
after hys iudgment.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.44

But now I returne againe to mens studyes and ententes, whose mynde and
harte sekethe soueraygne good or perfite felycitie, although it be with
an imperfette and dull memorye drownyd of worldely goodes, wandryng
as a dronken man that knoeth not whych way to go home to hys house.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.45

Seme they to erre and goo oute of the waye that labouryth to haue ynoughe
and to haue nede of nothynge?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.46

noo truelye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.47

Certes there is nothynge that more performeth and geueth blessednes then
a plenteous estate of al goods hauyng ynough hymselfe of his owne and
nede of none other mans, BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.48

Do they erre from felycitie, that do thynke that thynge moste worthy
reuerence and honor y=t= is best?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.49

No truely: BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.50

For that thing is not vyle and to be dyspysed that the entente
of all men lyuyng <paren> almoste <$$paren> laboureth to optayne.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.51

Is not power, to be nombred in ryches?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.52

What ells?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.53

Is the thynge to be estemyd weke and feble without strength, that
semethe to be more worthye and stronger then all other thyngs?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.54

no truely.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.55

Is glory fame and renoune nothyng estemyd?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.56

no not so.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.57

For it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be denyed but that all thyng, that is most
excellent, semythe to be moste gloryous, and clere.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.58

For it is manyfest that blessednes is not carefull and sadde, nor
subiect to doloures, and greifes, but full of pleasures and gladnes,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.59

what should a man say more when in the leste thynges that can be, some
thynge is desyred that delytethe a man to haue, and to enioye as hys owne.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.60

And these be the thynges that menne woulde wisshe to haue,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,56.61

and for thys <P_57> cause they doo seke for and desyre ryches dignities ,
rule, glory and pleasures, that by them they do thynke that they shal
haue suffisans, reuere~ce, power, renoune, fame, myrth, and gladnes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,57.62

Therefore that thinge muste nedes be good, that men do aske and seke for
soo manye dyuers and sundrye wayes.  In the which sekyng it is lyghtly
shewed, and euydentlye it apperyth, how great the power and strengthe of
nature is, that thoughe the sentences and iudgementes of men be dyuerse
one contrary to another: yet $for $all {TEXT:forall} that in louynge
and desyryng the ende of good and blessednes, they do agre and be of
one mynde and iudgemente.  {COM:material_omitted} BOETHCO-E1-P2,57.63

<P_58>

Certes, O you erthly men, you do know vnperfetly or as it were in a dreme,
your owne begynnyng and the verye ende of true felicitie, although you do
se it by a thynne or slender imagination or fantasye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.65

And therfore your naturall intent and purpose ledeth you to the true
good or blessednes, BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.66

and much error withdraweth you from the same.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.67

Consyder nowe than Boecius whether that men may com to that perfyt ende
and blessednes by such thyngs as me~ thought {by} they shuld come by
nature, that is to say, yf that ryches or honors and suche temporall
thynges can brynge a man anye suche thinge that hath suffisaunce and
wantyth nothynge at all.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.68

For then I wold thynke that some men were blessed and happye by opteynyng
of these foresaid thinges, that is to saye: that hath the sayde goodes
of fortune all redye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.69

But and yf those thynges, that is to saye: worldely goodes $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} do the things that they do promysse, and do wante muche
goodes, Is not then the kynde of false felicitie apprehended and $known
{TEXT:knoen} openly by them?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.70

Therefore I aske the Boecius fyrste of all <paren> whyche not longe agoo
diddest habound in riches <$$paren> whether that care dyd not trouble
thy mynde for euery wronge done emongest all those aboundaunt ryches.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.71

BOE: Certes I doo saye that I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} remember that I
was euer of so quiet mynde, but that somethynge dydde alwayes greue me.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.72

PHIL: Dyddyst not $thou {TEXT:thon} want some thynge that thou woldest
haue had, or thou haddest so~thing that thou wouldest not haue hadde?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.73

BOE: I saye it is euen soo.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.74

PHIL: Then thou desyreddeste to haue the thynge that thou dyddest lack,
and to lacke that thou haddest.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,58.75

<P_59>

BOE: I saye I do confesse no lesse.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.77

PHIL: Then there nedeth some thynge that euery man desyrethe, that is
to saye: Then euery man hath nede.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.78

BOE: I graunt that euery man laketh.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.79

PHIL: Then he that hath nede of anye thinge, is not thoroughly suffised
and contented.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.80

BOE: I saye the same.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.81

P. So then thou lackeddest suffisau~ce, when thou haddyst
aboundaunce of ryches.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.82

BOE: I saye what ells.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.83

PHIL: Then ryches $can $not {TEXT:cannot} make a man haue Inough or to
be contented, $with {TEXT:whyche} that hee hathe, whyche was the thing
that they semed to promise.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.84

And certes this thing I do thynke cheifelye to be considered, that mony by
his owne nature and kynde hath nothynge that it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be
taken fromme theym that haue it, agaynste theyr wyll, BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.85

that is to saye: that it hath nothyng in it, but may be taken away
whether they wyll or not that haue it.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.86

BOE: I do knowledge, that it is so.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.87

PHIL.  Why shouldest thou not confesse it, when the stronger folke takethe
it awaye dayly, from the weaker against theyr wyll?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.88

For els whence commethe all these complayntes in courtes, butt $that
{TEXT:hat} mony is taken awaye, from folke agaynst theyr wyll, eyther
by force or by crafte and deceyte.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.89

BOE: I say it is soo.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.90

PHIL: Than euerye man shal haue nede of some outwarde helpe, whereby he
maye kepe hys monye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.91

BOE: Who wyl deny that.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.92

P. Certes he shuld haue no nede thereof, but for that he hath mony,
that he maye lese.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.93

BOE: I say there is no doute thereof.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.94

PHIL: Therefore the matter of monye is otherwyse, the~ men do thinke
it is.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.95

For y=e= ryches that were thought to make men to haue suffisaunce and to
be contented, makethe theym rather to haue nede of other mennes helpe.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.96

What waye is there whereby indigence and nede maye be put away and
satysfied with riches?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.97

Canne not ryche men be hungerye?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.98

Canne not ryche men be thrystye?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.99

Doo the members and lymes of ryche men, fele no wynter colde?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.100

But thou wylte saye that ryche men haue Inoughe, to slacke theyr hu~ger
to quench ther thirst and to kepe them from cold.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.101

Certes by this waye nede and pouertie maye be eased by ryches.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.102

But it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be clene taken awaye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,59.103

For yf thys indigence and nede, alwayes gapyng and desyrynge riches,
might be satisfied with riches, then it behoueth that there remayne and
be such a nede and indigence, that may be fulfylled and <P_60> satysfyed.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.104

But I holde my peace BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.105

and wyll not tell that a lytell thynge suffyseth nature, but nothynge
is Inoughe or suffyseth couetuousnes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.106

Wherefore if ryches $can $not {TEXT:cannot} put away indigence and nede,
but doo cause and make indigence and nede?  how may it be, that ye can
beleue that ryches geueth and bryngeth to any man ynough or suffysaunce.
{COM:material_omitted} BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.107

PHILOSOPHY.  But, do dignities make him honorable and reuerend, that
hath them?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.108

Is there such vertue in dignyties, that they maye put vertues in the
mindes of them that haue dignities and expell vyce?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.109

Truelye they be not wonte to expell vyce and wyckednes, but rather to
augment the same.  Wherefore I haue dysdayne that dignyties should so
often happen vnto wycked and vitious men.  For whyche thinge Catulus
that was a vertuous wise ma~ in Rome <paren> Seinge Nonius a vicyous
man, syttinge in the place of dignitie and iudgmente <$$paren> called
hym a swellynge full of corruption <paren> that is to saye <$$paren>
a man hauynge an hepe of vyces, in hys breste.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.110

As the swellynge in the necke called Struma, is ful {of} corruption
impostumed so was he full of vyce and wyckednes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.111

Seyst thou not howe grete shame and vylanye dignities bryngeth to
wicked folke?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.112

Truelye the vnworthines or malyce of them shuld lesse appere, yf they
were not honored.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.113

O Boecius myghtist thou be brought to so greate perylles, that thou
wouldeste thynke or be contented to bere offyce or be felowe in offyce
with the man named Decorate, when thou sawest in hym the hart and mynde
of a wycked knaue and accuser of men?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.114

Certes I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} iudge them, worthy reuere~ce for their
honors, who~ I deem vnworthy to haue such honors.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.115

But yf thou sawest a man ful of wysdome, myghtest thou thynke
him, vnworthy of reuerence, or of the wysdom that he hath?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,60.116

<P_61>

BOE: No truely.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.118

PHYLO: Certes dygnyties be properly incident to vertue.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.119

And vertue gyueth dygnyties anone to them, to whom dignities shal
be ioyned.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.120

And for bycause that honours, that the people do gyue to men, can not
make men worthye such honours: it appereth that honours haue no proper
beautie, or similitude of dignytie of it selfe.  In whiche thynge the
same thynge aboue sayde, is to be consydered.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.121

For yf a man be so moche the lesse estemed, bycause he is dyspysed
of many?  When that dygnytie can not make euyll men reuerende: then
dygnitie maketh y=e= euil folke, be rather dyspraysed, then praysed,
which disprayse dignytie sheweth to many.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.122

And truely not without a cause.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.123

For the wycked do reuenge them selfe vpon dygnytie, when they defowle it,
with theyr vilanye and wyckednes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.124

And that thou mayst knowe that the same trewe reuerence can not happen
to any man by these shadowy or transytorie dygnyties, vnderstande thus.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.125

If a man had vsed to haue moch dygnytie in the Co~sul ship, and by chau~ce
come emongest straunge nacions, shulde his honoure of the consull shyp,
make him to be honoured amongest the straungers?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.126

But and yf this honoure, were a naturall geste to dygnyties, they myght
neuer cease any where, amongest people fro~ doynge theyr offyce and
dutie, as the fyre in euery countrye neuer ceaseth to heate and warme.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.127

But for bycause, to be reuerenced and honourable co~meth not to anye
of the proper nature and strength in it selfe, but mans false and
vayne opinion causeth it: anone when they come there vnto them that
esteme not the same dygnyties, theyr honours immedyatlye vanysshe awaye
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.128

and cease.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.129

But thou maist say, y=t= it is so amongest strau~ge nacions.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.130

Do not the dignyties endure alwaies amongest the~, where they first began?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.131

Understand no.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.132

Trulye the dygnyte of the prefectory, was somtyme a great power,
amonge the Romaynes, which nowe is nothyng els, but a vayne name,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.133

and the dygnytie of the senatours, that somtime was estemed a hyghe
honoure is nowe a great burden or charge.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.134

And yf a man had the offyce to take hede of corne and other vytayle of
the people, he was taken for a greate man.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.135

Nowe what is lesse estemed then the said prouostship?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.136

Certes as I sayde a lytell before, the thynge that hath no proper beawtye,
or worshype of it selfe, receyueth some tyme renoune and some tyme loseth
renoune by meanes of the vsage of the thinge.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,61.137

If therefore dignities $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <P_62> make men reuerende?
If by their own meanes, they were foule, and by the vice of wicked folke?
If they lose their bewtye and vertue by mutacion of tymes?  And if they
become detestable and foule, in mens estimacion?  what goodnes is in
them to be desyred, and $can $not {TEXT:cannot} geue the same vnto other?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.138

vnderstand none at all.  {COM:material_omitted} BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.139

PHILOSOPHY.  Can kingdomes and the acquaintaunce or fauoure of kinges,
make a man myghtye?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.140

He aunswerith himself in mockynge <paren> called Ironice <$$paren>
what elles, when that their power enduryth euer?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.141

But surely olde tyme past, and thys our present age, and tyme, is full
of examples y=t= kyngs haue chaungyd their felicitie, into sorowe and
calamyte.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.142

And phylosophye sayth agayne Ironice, O full noble and hyghe excellent
is that power, whyche is not founde sufficient ynoughe to preserue and
defend it selfe.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.143

And if the power of kynges be the cause of blessednes or felicitie,
if the same power faileth in any part, do it not diminisshe felicitye,
and bryngeth in wretchednes and miserye?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.144

But yet although the empire, and rule of mankynde be spred very wyde,
and brode, It behouethe that there be many people lefte, and remaynynge ,
ouer whome euerye Kynge hath not dominion.  So that, on whatsoeuer syde,
power wanteth, that shuld make men blysfull and happye, on the same syde
entreth weakenes or lacke of power that maketh men wretches.  So that by
this meanes it must nedes be, that there is in kynges more wretchednes
and infelicite: then blessednes and felycitie.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,62.145

A certayne Tyraunte that hadde experience of the peryll of his <P_63>
estate and fortune, dyd declare and shewe the feare and dreade of his
kyngedome by the terrours of a sworde hangynge ouer the heade of one of
hys famylyer frendes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.146

What is therefore this power that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} put
awaye the bytinge of carefulnes, nor auoid the prickings of feare.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.147

Certes these kynges would fayne lyue safely and sure, BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.148

but they ca~ not.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.149

Maye they therefore from henceforthe reioyse of theyr power?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.150

Doest thou iudge hym myghtye whom thou seyst would do that thynge that
he ca~ not do?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.151

Doest thou esteme him myghtye that hath many men of armes, aboute hym?
That more fearythe them that feareth him?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.152

how semeth he mightye that is put in the handes of hys seruauntes?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.153

For what shal I say of them that be in the fauour of kynges, when that
I my selfe haue shewed the, that the same kyngedomes of themselfe be
vnsure and mutable.  And that often tymes the power of kynges, when
it decayethe and fayleth, ouer throweth such as it auaunsed whe~ it
flourished and was in prosperitie.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.154

Kynge Nero constrayned Seneke his familiar maister that taughte hym,
to chose what death he woulde dye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.155

Antonius, commaunded Papinion, that hadde bene longe a valiaunt
man in y=e= court, to be slayne with the swordes of knyghtes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.156

And both of them, that is to saye: Senecke, and Papinion, would haue
forsaken and haue yelded vp their power and aucthoritie yf they myght.
Of the whyche two notable menne, Senecke labored to geue vnto Nero
his riches, to haue his fauour and to go himselfe into exile alone.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.157

But whyles that the same aucthoritie and power of kynges ruleth men
redye to fall, and in suche indignation, nether of them, that is to saye:
of Seneke and Papinion, myght do that he woulde.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.158

Therefore what is this power, whych when men haue it, that they be aferde
of?  whych whe~ thou wouldst haue it, thou art not suer of it, And when
thou wouldest leue it, thou cannest not eschewe it.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.159

Be they more thy frendes at nede, that fortune, and not vertue getteth?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.160

But surelye whome good fortune maketh thy frende, euyll fortune maketh
thine enemye and foe.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,63.161

PHILOSOPHY.  But how deceyueable is glory ofte~tymes, whervpon <paren>
not withoute cause <$$paren> a certayne poete <paren> that vsed to
make dities <$$paren> cried oute and sayde.  O glory glorye, emongeste
thousands of men, thou art nothyng ells but a great swellynge or fillynge
of mens eares.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.165

For certes manye men, haue receyued and had often grete fame, by the
false opinion of the people.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.166

And what thing may be thought more feble, then suche fame of the people
: BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.167

For they y=t be praysed vnworthelye, ought to be ashamed of their prayse,
whyche prayses if they be iustly deserued, what thinge hath it augmentyd
to the conscience of a wise ma~, that mesureth not his good by the rumour
of the people, but by the truth of hys conscience.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.168

And yf this thing be goodly to haue a fame spredde abrode, then
is it a consequence that it is a foul thinge to be kept close.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.169

And as I sayde a lytell before, that it muste neades be that there
be manye people, to whome the fame of one man $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
come , it foloweth then that he whome thou estemest to be famous and
renomed semeth not gloryous nor famous, in the moste parte of the worlde.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.170

And truelye emongest these thynges, I do not thynke the fauour or prayse
of the people worthye to be remembred, that commeth not by wyse and iuste
iudgment, nor firmely endureth or continueth euer.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.171

Nowe truely, what man seith not how vaine and slipperie the name of
nobilitie and gentlesse is?  Whych if it be referred to glorye and
renoune of lynage, it is none of theirs that soo do glorye therin.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,64.172

For nobilitie or gentlesse semeth to be a certayne prayse, commynge
by the <P_65> deserts of their $auncestoures {TEXT:auncetoures}.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.173

And if laude and praysynge maketh nobilitie or gentelesse, then muste
they be nedes noble and gentyll, that be praysed.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.174

Therfore another mans glory, nobilitie, or gentelles, maketh not the
noble or gentle, yf thou haue no nobilitie or gentlesse of thy selfe,
commynge by thine owne desertes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.175

But Certes yf ther be any good in noblesse or gentles, I thynke it semeth
to be as a thynge of necessitie ioyned to noblesse and gentles , that
they do not degenerate or vary from the vertue of their noble , or gentle
progenitours and auncestours.  {COM:material_omitted} BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.176

PHILOSOPHY.  But what shall I saye of corporall plesures, the desire
whereof is full of carefulnes, and the satisfyenge thereof is ful of
payne and sorow, BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.177

how great sycknes and intollerable dolours be these pleasures wonte to
brynge to the bodyes of suche as do vse them, as a certayne fruyte of
such wyckednes, of the whyche pleasures, what delectacion their motions
and effectes haue, I know not.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.178

For whosoeuer wil reme~ber hymselfe of his pleasurs, he shall well knowe
that the endes thereof be sorow full and greuous.  Whyche pleasures
temporall if they coulde make men blessed and happye, then is there
no cause but that brute beastes may also be called blessed, whose
hole intent and purpose, hasteth to fulfyll their bodelye plesure.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.179

The reioysynge also of wyfe and chyldren should be honest,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,65.180

but it is <P_66> said much agaynst nature and kynde, that some haue had

But wyth howe great perylles and euyls, they be wrapped, I will shew
you shortlye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.185

Certes what thynge of these folowing is without peryll.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.186

Thou shalte not goo aboute to gather monye, BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.187

but thou shalte take it awaye from some man that hathe it.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.188

If thou wouldeste shyne wyth dignities, thou must make peticion to hym
that geueth them?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.189

If thou desirest to excell others in honoure, thou makest thy selfe
subiecte, by humble askynge of them.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.190

If thou desire power: thou shalt be in daunger of beseging or layinge
in awayte of them that be inferiors to the?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.191

If thou aske glory, thou being troubled wyth euery aduersitie, ca~nest
not be quyet.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.192

And if thou woldest lede a voluptuouse lyfe, euery ma~ wold dispise the

and dedes, most vyle and bryttell, BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.193

that is to saye: that thou art a bondeman to the vile pleasures of
thy bodye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,66.194

Nowe than, they that desyre corporall goodes aboue them selfe, that is
to saye: aboue reason, <P_67> howe lytell and frayle possessyon do they
labour for?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.195

Cannyst thou excell the elephantes in greatenes, or the bulles in

mayste thou surmou~t the tyger in swiftnes?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.197

loke vpon the space and compasse of the firmame~t the stedfastnes and
swyftenes thereof, BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.198

and than cesse to wonder at these vile inferior worldly thinges.
Whych fyrmament certes is not rather to be wondred at for these thynges,
but for the self same reson wherby it is gouerned.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.199

But how swyftly passynge away and transitorye and howe fletynge and more
swyfter fadynge awaye, is the beawty of the body, the~ y=e= mutabilitie
or chau~ge of the sommer flowers.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.200

And <paren> as Aristotle sayth <$$paren> if that men had eyes as quick as
a beast named Lynx, soo that their sighte myghte se thorowe or penetrate
the bodies that they doo see, shoulde not that bodye of Alcibiades that
was mooste fayre without fourthe, seme most foule within to them that
sawe y=e= in trayles, or inner partes thereof?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.201

And so therefore thy owne nature causethe not the to seme fayre,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.202

but the wekenes of the eyes, that loketh vpon the, cawseth it.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,67.203

But esteme thou the goodes or fayrenes of the bodye as much as thou wylt,
so that thou doest knowe that the same goodes or fayrenes, whatsoeuer it
be that thou meruailest at, or so estemest, maye be dessolued and clene

Of all whyche thyngs before sayd, a man may gather breyfely that these
worldely thynges, that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} perfourme the goodnes
that they promes or seme to haue in the~ nor be yet perfytte by hepynge

For thou remembrest me the seco~d tyme of these thyngs.

Fyrst y=u= remembrest me that I lost my memory, by the contagious
coniunction of the body and soule.  And afterwarde when I was oppressed
wyth the bourden of my dolour and sorowe.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,82.209

PHIL: If thou beholde the thynges before graunted, it shall not be farre
of but thou shalt remembre the thyng that thou of late diddest confesse,
that thou knewest not.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,82.210

BOETIUS.  What thinge was that?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,82.211

PHYLOSOPHY.  By what gouernemente the worlde is gouerned.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,82.212

BOECIUS.  I remember well that I confessed that I knewe it not,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,82.213

but althoughe I se now what thou purposeste, yet I desyre to here it
more plainely of the.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,82.214

<P_83>

PHIL: Thou thoughtest it no doughte, a lytle before that this worlde is
gouerned by God.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.216

BOE: Certes I thynke it no dought BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.217

nor neuer wyll, BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.218

and I wil shew the shortly by what resones I am brought to it.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.219

Thys worlde colde neuer be brought into one forme of soo dyuers contrarye
partes, excepte that there were one that ioyned together such dyuers
thynges.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.220

And the same dyuersitie of nature so varieng one from another woulde
seperate and deuyde a sunder, the thynges that be ioyned together, except
ther were one that held together the thing that he hath knyt together.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.221

And the order of nature, shoulde not go fourth, so certainely, nor shewe
so ordinary mouinges, in places, times, $effects {TEXT:effect} spaces,
and qualities, except ther were one that remayned alwayes stedefast,
and dysposed and ordryd the same varieties and chaunges of thyngs.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.222

And the same one whatsoeuer it be whereby al thynges that be made,
do remayne and be moued, I call God by a name that is commenly vsed of
al folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.223

PHIL: Then whyles thou art of that opinio~, I think I haue lytle els to
do, but that thou beinge sure of felycytye and blessednes, mayst go se
thy countraye safe and sound.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.224

But let vs beholde the thynges that we purposed before.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.225

Haue I not nombred suffysaunce in felycitie and blessednes?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.226

And haue we not agreed that the same felicitie and blessednes is God?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.227

PHIL: And that he shall nede no outward help to gouerne the worlde?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.229

For yf he shoulde nede, he shoulde not haue full suffysaunce.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.230

BOE: It must nedes be so.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.231

PHIL: Then he alone orderethe al thynges.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.232

BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.234

BOE: I do wel remember it.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.235

PHIL: Then he dysposeth all thyngs by the same good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.236

And if he who~ we haue agreed to be good, do rule al thynges, alone by
hymselfe then is he as a certaine key and sterne wherby the whole worlde
is kept stedefast and withoute corruption.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.237

BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.241

BOE: I say what is that?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,83.242

PHIL: When it is beleued fully and truly that God gouerneth all thynges
wyth the keye of <P_84> his goodnes, and that all the same thinges that
I haue taught, do make haste by naturall intencion to come to good,
maye it be doughted but they be gouerned wyllyngly?  And do turne them
self of ther fre wyl at the commaundement of there gouernor as thynges
conuenyent and obeying there gouernoure?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.243

BOE: I saye it muste nedes be soo, and that rule of God shoulde not
seme blessed, yf there shoulde be a yoke of vnruly thinges that draweth
peruersly backwarde, or stubbournelye, and no comforte of obedyent
thinges, submytting them selfe to good order.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.244

BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.251

PHY: Then it is the same soueraygne good, that ruleth all thynges
stronglye and dysposeth them gently.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.252

BOE: I say, the same wordes that thou vsyste, do moche more delyght me,
then the effect and ende of the reasons, that thou hast concluded ,
so that we fooles <paren> that do reprehende and rebuke some tyme
great thynges that toucheth goddes myghtie work <$$paren> may be at

that God refuseth the workes of men, and nothyng medleth therwith.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.253

PHY: Thou haste harde in fables, that gyauntes haue ben aboute to assaute
heauen, but the gentle strength of God, hath deposed and dystroyed them,
as it was mete and worthy, BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.254

but wylte thou that we knit togither the same resons?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.255

Perchaunce of suche conference, or dysputacion, some goodly sparke of

PHY: May God do any euyll?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.262

PHIL.  Then euyll is nothinge when that he $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
doo it that canne do all thynges.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,84.264

BOE: I saye doest thou mocke me weyuynge or knyttynge together a
meruaylous subtyle laborinth by thy reasons, that haue no ende lyke a

And thou foldyst together maruaylous compassyng rounde resons of the
symple or pure dyuinitie.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.266

For a lytel before thou begynnyng at blessednes saydeste that the
same was soueraygne good, which blessednes thou saydest was in God.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.267

And also thou saydest that God was soueraygne good and full of felycitie,
or blessednes, wherby thou dyddest proue as a corrolarye, or conclusion
that no man was blessed but God.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.268

And thou saydest also that the forme of good, is the substaunce of God,
and of blessednes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.269

And thou saidest that the same one thynge was the same good thyng,
that was desyred by nature of all thynges.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.270

And thou dyddeste proue that God ruleth all thynges by the gouernaunces
of hys bountiousnes, and that al thynges obeyeth hym, howe vyolent soeuer
they be, BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.271

and thou saydeste that there is no nature of euyll.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.272

And thou dyddeste proue these thynges by no outewarde reasons, but by
proues takynge aucthoritie one thynge of another, and by inwarde and
proper or famylyer probation.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.273

PHI. Then I do not mocke saieth philosophy, BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.274

but I haue shewed the, the greatest thing of all by the gyft of God,
whome of late we prayed vnto.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.275

For certes suche is the forme of the diuine substaunce, that it falleth
and slydethe not into outward or straunge thynges nor receyueth any
outward or straung thynge into it selfe, BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.276

but as the philosopher Permenides saith of the substau~ce of God.
Thou ledest all the multitude of thynges in a cyrcle, BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.277

that is to saye: the deuyne substaunce turnyth the mouynge worlde of
thynges round lyke a compas whiles that the same substau~ce kepeth it
selfe stedfast and immouable.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,85.278

And if I haue stirred resons, not taken from without, but set within
the compas of the thynge that we treate of, there is nothynge that
thou shouldeste meruaile at since thou hast lerned with Plato <paren>
saying <$$paren> that the words ought to be conuenient and agreing
to the thinges, whereof they be spoken, or whereof men do speke.

<$$heading>

BOECIUS.  When Phylosophye <paren> after that she hade kept the reuerence,
of her countenaunce and grauitie of her spekyng <$$paren> had songe these
thynges softly and swetely.  Then I <paren> that had not vtterly forgotten
my inwarde gryfe and sorowe <$$paren> dyd interrupte her intent and
purpose beyng yet redy to speke some other thyng.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.284

And I sayd: O thou gyde and leder of the very true lyght or knoledge,
euen the same thinges that thy owne wordes haue spoken hetherto, haue
appered vnto me inuincible, aswell for there deuine speculacion as for
thy resons.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.285

And the same very thinges that thou shewedst me, althoughe I had forgotten
them for sorow of the wronge that was done to me, yet for all that they
were not vnto me vtterly unknowen.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.286

But thys is the cheifeste cause of my greyfe and sorowe, that
where as the ruler of all thynges is good, why be there any euiles,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.287

or why do euiles passe vnponyshed?  Whyche thynge alone well consydered,
howe much is it worthy to be meruayled at?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.288

But yet ther is another greater thyng to be ioyned to thys, moreouer to
be meruayled at.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.289

For whiles that wickednes ruleth and flourysheth, vertue is not only
vnrewarded, but also subiect and troden vnder the fete of the wicked
BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.290

and is ponyshed in stede of wicked offenders, whych thynges to be suffered
in the kyngdom of God that knoweth all thynges, able to do al thinges,
and willyng to do onely good thynges, no man maye thereat nether meruayle
ynoughe, nor complayne ynoughe.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,88.291

PHI. It shoulde be a greate infynite wonder and more horrible
then all the monsters of the world, if it were so as thou takest it,
that euyl men should be worshypped and that good men shuld be vyle or
nothyng estemed in the well ordred <P_89> house of suche a father of
the howshold, BOETHCO-E1-P2,89.292

but it is not so.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,89.293

For if those thynges that be concluded a lytell before, be kepte hole
or vnbroken, thou shalt knowe <paren> the same God of whose kyngedome
now I speake, beynge the aucthor <$$paren> that good me~ be alwais
mightye, and euyll men always abiect and vnmyghty or weke, and that
vyces be neuer vnponyshed, nor vertue vnrewarded, and that felicitie
and blessednes happeth to good folke, and myschaunces to wycked folke.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,89.294

And thou shalte knowe manye thynges of thys kynd which may strengthen
the with stedfaste sadnes, when thou haste put awaye thy complayntes,
agaynst euill fortune.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,89.295

And for by cause thou haste sene the fourme of true blessednes or
felycitie, as I of late haue shewed the, and that thou haste knowen
wherein it is set, all thynges omytted and ouerpassed that I thynke
mete to omit and passe ouer, I wyll shewe vnto the, the waye that maye
brynge the home, to the knowledge of true blessednes and felicitie.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,89.296

And I wyll fasten fethers or resones in thy mynde, wherby it may ryse
vp in helth, so that after thou hast cast awaye all trouble of worldly
and temporall thynges, thou mayst reuert and turne into thy countrye
safe and sounde, by my leding, by my path way and by my steppes.

BOECIUS.  Then when Phylosophy had ended her tale, I sayde.  O Phylosophy
thou promisest gret thinges BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.299

and I dought not but thou mayst perfourme them.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.300

And I praye the tarye not BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.301

but tell me now, seing thou haste styrryd me to here.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.302

PHI. Fyrst it behoueth the to knowe that good men be myghty,
and wycked men be alwaies vnmyghtye and weke of all strength, of the
whych the one is shewed by the other.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.303

For when that good and euyll be thynges contrary, yf good appereth
to be myghty and stronge, then the wekenes of the euill is manifest.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.304

And when the frayltie of euyll shewethe it selfe, then the stedefastnes
of good is perceyued.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.305

But to thintent that more credite shoulde be geuen to my saying, I will
procede by both wayes <paren> confyrmynge the thynges that be proposed
<$$paren> BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.306

now on the one parte, BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.307

and nowe the thother parte.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.308

There be two thynges or pryncyples, wherin standeth theffect of all
menes actes and dedes, BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.309

that is to saye: wyl, and power.  Of the whych if eyther of them fayle,
there is nothynge that can be done.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,90.310

For if that wyl fayleth none effect is <P_91> done.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.311

For no manne taketh in hand to doo the thynge that he will not do.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.312

And if power be away wyll is in vayne or voyde, whereby it commeth to
passe that yf thou see anye man that would obtayne, that he $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} get, thou mayst not dought, but he wanteth power, to haue
that he wold haue.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.313

BOE: It is verye clere BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.314

and maye not be doughted in any maner.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.315

PHIL: Truelye yf thou se anye man to haue done that he woulde doo
, $doubtest {TEXT:doughest} thou that he lacked power to do it.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.316

BOE: No.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.317

PHIL: Than BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.318

that thing that a man maye doo, in that thynge, he is myghtye,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.319

and in that thynge that he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do, he is to be iudged
vnmyghtye and weke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.320

BOE: I saye I confesse the same.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.321

PHIL: Remembrest thou by the former resones, that it is gathered or
concluded, that al thentent of mans wyll maketh hast or tendeth vnto
felicitie or blessednes, whyche is ledde by dyuers studies or wayes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.322

BOE: I saye I do remember that the same was so shewed and declared before.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.323

PHY: And doest thou remember that the same felycitie or blessednes is the
same good, and after the same maner desyred, of all men when felicitie
is requyred?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.324

BOE: I saye I doo not recorde it, BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.325

for I holde it fired in my mynd or memory.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.326

PHIL: Then all men both good and also euyll doo laboure to come to good
without any difference of intent.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.327

BOE: I say the same, BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.328

it is a very consequence.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.329

PHI. Then it is certayne that men be made good by adoption or
optaynynge of good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.330

BOE: It is true.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.331

PHIL: Then good men do optayne the thynge that they do desyre.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.332

BOE: So it semeth.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.333

PHIL: Then truely if euel men should get and obtayne the good that they
do desyre they myght not be euil.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.334

BOE: It is euen so.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.335

PHIL: Then when that both the good and the euyll folke desyreth good,
yf the good folke obtayneth the good and the euil folke do not, Is it
nowe anye doughte but that the good folke be myghty, and the euill folke
weke and vnmyghtye?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.336

BOE: I saye whosoeuer doughteth of thys, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} consyder
the nature of thyngs, nor the consequence of reson.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.337

PH: And farther if there be two that haue one naturall purpose or intent ,
and the one of them worketh and perfourmethe the same thynge by offyce
of nature or naturallye, and the other may not do the same by naturall
offyce, or naturallye, but foloweth hym that perfourmeth the offyce
naturallye, but yet by a nother wayes, or meane, then is conueniente
for nature, and dooeth not fulfyll or perfourme the purpose, whych of
these two iudgest thou to be mooste myghtye?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,91.338

BOECIUS.  Althoughe I do coniecture <P_92> what thou wouldeste saye,
yet I desyre to heare it moore fullye of the.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.339

PHIL: Then, wilt thou denye that the mouing to walke or go is in men by
nature, or that it is not naturall?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.340

BOE: I do saye I do not denye it.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.341

PHILO: Then, doughtest thou that the acte of going is the naturall offyce
of the fete?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.342

BOE: I saye I dought it not.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.343

PHIL: Then if a man beynge myghtye to go vpon his fete walketh, another
that lacketh the naturall offyce of hys fete laboureth to go vpon his
handes, which of these may iustelye be iudged more strong or myghtye.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.344

BOE: I saye procede in thy other sayinges, BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.345

for noo man doughteth but that he that maye go by naturall offyce
of hys fete, is stronger, then he that maye not do the same.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.346

PHIL: Even soo the soueraygne good before spoken of is shewed
indifferently, as wel vnto the euyll folke as to the good folke,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.347

but the good doo optayne it by the naturall offyce of vertue,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.348

and the wycked folke do enforce themselfe to get it by sundry couytous
desyres of temporall and worldly thinges, whyche is not the naturall
offyce or meane to obteyne good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.349

Doist thou thynke it otherwyse?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.350

BOE: No truely BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.351

for the thyng, that is the consequence is manyfest, BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.352

And of these thinges that I haue graunted, it is necessarye,
that good folke be myghtye and euyll folke vnmyghtye and weake.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.353

PHIL: Thou sayest right, BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.354

and it is a sygne or iudgement that nature is recouered in the and
resisteth the dyssease, as the phisicions be wonte to hope of the paciente
and sycke folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.355

But for by cause I see the redy to vnderstand, I shall shewe the diuers
and many sundry reasons.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.356

For see howe gretely the wekenes of wycked and euyll folke appereth
that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attayne vnto the thynge that ther
natural intencyon ledeth, and in a maner almost compelleth the~ {to}.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.357

And what yf that the same wycked folke shoulde lacke this so grete and
al most inuyncible helpe of nature.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.358

Consider also how lytle power the wycked folke hath, BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.359

for they seke not lyght and vayne rewardes, whych they can not folowe
and obtayne.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.360

But they fayle BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.361

and $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attayne the cheyfest and hyest thynges that
is to saye soueraygne good, BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.362

nor these wycked wretches, can gette the effecte of soueraygne good,
whyche they go aboute onely to obtayne night and daye, wherin the myghte
of good folke doth appere.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,92.363

For certis, as thou woldest iudge hym moste myghtie and stronge in goynge
, that may come to the place in going on his feet, beyonde the which
place there lyeth no way farther to go: <P_93> euen so it behoueth that
thou do iudge hym, moste stronge and myghtie, that optayneth the end of
al thynges that be to be desired, beyonde whiche ende, there is nothyng :
whych ende, good folke doe optayne, whereby it foloweth that ther is a
thyng contrary to this, that is to saye: that these wycked seme to be
desolate, naked, or voyd of all strength.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.364

But why do the wicked folke folowe wyckednes and forsake vertue?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.365

is it for that they be ignoraunt of good thinges?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.366

But what is more feble then the blyndnes of ignoraunce?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.367

Do the wycked know that good is to be folowed?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.368

ye truely, but that couitousnes, ouerthroweth them being clene turnyd
fro~ good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.369

And they be also frayle by intemperaunce of vice, that $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} resist vyce, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.370

and whether they <paren> knowynge and wyllyng <$$paren> do forsake the
good and be turned vnto vyces?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.371

Ye truely, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.372

And by thys meanes they cesse not onelye to be myghtye and stronge,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.373

but also they cesse vtterly to be.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.374

For they that forsake the ende of al thynges that be, do cesse also to
be, or haue no beinge, whych thyng perchaunce should seme to some man a
meruayle, that I shuld say that wycked folke <paren> whyche be the most
part of men <$$paren> be not, or haue no beynge.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.375

But it is euen soo.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.376

For they that be wycked <paren> I doo not denye <$$paren> but that they
be wycked, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.377

but I denye that they be pure and symple.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.378

For as thou hast called a dede man a Corpus or carkes, and maye not call
hym simply and purely a man, euen soo haue I graunted that vicious and
wicked folke be wycked, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.379

but I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} confesse that they be absolutely
with out any dyuersitie as they were before they were vicious.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.380

For the thinge that kepeth order, kepeth nature, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.381

and is styll as it was, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.382

but the thing that varyeth from order and nature, forsaketh the thyng
that is set in his $nature {TEXT:natur}.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.383

But thou wilt say that wycked folke may do things: BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.384

Certes I wyll not deny, but that they may do.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.385

But I say that their power, commeth not by strength, but by wekenes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.386

For they may doo euyll thynges which they might not do if they might
remayne in the workes of good folke, BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.387

And the same possybylitie or power of euyll folke, shewethe euidentlye
that they maye do ryght nought.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.388

For as I haue gathered and proued a lytle before that euyll is nought
or nothyng, whe~ that the euyll folke may onely do euil, It appereth
a playne conclusion, that euyll folke may do ryght nought, and haue no
power or myghte.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.389

BOETI: It is playne soo.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,93.390

PHILO: Then, that thou mayst vnderstand what is the strengthe of
this power, <P_94> that y=e= wycked may do nought, I haue defyned and
determyned a lytel before that nothynge is more myghty then soueraygne
good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.391

BOE: I saye it is so.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.392

PHIL: But y=e= same soueraygne good can do no euyll.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.393

BOE: No forsoth.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.394

PHIL: Then is there any man that thynketh that men can do all thynges.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.395

BOE: No man so thinketh, except he be mad.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.396

PHIL: But yet wycked folke may do euyll.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.397

BO. I say would to God they coulde not.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.398

PHIL: Now then when that he that is myghtye in good thynges may doo
all thynges, but they that be myghtye in euyll thynges, maye not do al
things, It is manyfest that they that may do euyl, may do lesse or be
of lesse power.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.399

And soo it commethe to passe to proue thys conclusion, that I haue shewed
before, that is, that all power is to be numbred emongest thynges that
are to be desyred.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.400

And all thynges y=t= ought to be desired, are referred vnto good, that
is to say, vnto God, as vnto a certayne perfection of theyr nature.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.401

But the power or possibilytye to doo euyll, may not be referred vnto good,
that is to say, to God.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.402

Therfore euyll is not to be desyred.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.403

But all power is to be desyred.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.404

So therfore it appereth that the power of the wiked folk, is no power.
By all whyche thynges before sayde, it appereth truely, that good folke
be myghty, and wycked folke withoute any dought, be vnmyghtye and weake.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.405

And it appereth that the same sentence or sayinge of Plato, is true, that
sayd, that wyse men onely might do the thing that they desyred to doo.
And that wycked folke myght doo the thyng, that accordeth to ther wycked
pleasures, but they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} fulfyll and do the thyng,
that they desyre, that is to say, they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} obtayne
soueraign good, BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.406

yet they do all thynges, whyles they do thynke to attayne vnto the
soueraygne good that they desyre, by those thynges wherein they delite ,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.407

but they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} attayne therevnto.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.408

For wyckednes $can $not {TEXT:cannot} optayne and come vnto felicitie
and blessednes.  {COM:material_omitted} BOETHCO-E1-P2,94.409

<P_95>

PHILOSOPHY.  Seist thou not than in howe greate fylth the wycked folke
be wrapped, and with what clerenes the good folke do shyne.  In whych
thynge it is euydent and manyfest that good folke neuer want reward,
nor wicked folke neuer lacketh there ponyshmentes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,95.411

For of all thynges that be done, the thynge for the whych euery thynge
is done, the selfe same thynge, semethe wel to be the reward of the
same thing.  As yf a man do $run {TEXT:ren} in a furlonge space for
a crowne, the crowne is y=e= reward for the whych the rennynge is.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,95.412

And in like maner I haue shewed before, that felicitie or blessednes
is the selfe same thynge; for the whyche all thynges be done.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,95.413

Then is the same good, appoynted as a common rewarde for mannes
actes and dedes, whyche good, maye not be separated from good folke.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,95.414

And he shall not be called ryghtfully good, that lacketh goodnes,
wherefore men well <P_96> manered and vertuous, neuer loseth their
rewardes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.415

Therefore howe muche soeuer wycked folke waxe mad agaynste good folke,
yet for al that the wyse man shall neuer lose his crowne or reward,
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.416

nor shal drye vp or dymynyshe.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.417

Nor another mans wyckednes taketh not awaye the proper honoure frome
good folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.418

And yf good folke should reioyse of any outewarde good that they
haue receyued of anye other then of themselfes, truly he that gaue
them such goodnes, or some other person myght take it from them.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.419

But for asmuch as to euery man his owne proper goodnes is his rewarde
then euery man shall lacke his reward, when he cesseth, and is not good.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.420

Furthermore when that all reward, therefore is desyred, bycause it is
thought to be good who would iudge that he had noo rewarde, that is good?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.421

But what is the rewarde of good folke?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.422

Truely the fairest and gretest rewarde.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.423

But remember the same corrolarye or conclusyon that I gaue the as cheife
a litle before, BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.424

and vnderstand it thus.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.425

When y=e= sayd good is felicitie or blessednes, it appereth that all
good folke <paren> in as muche as they be good <$$paren> be made blessed
or happye.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.426

And it behoueth that they that be blessed, be goddes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.427

Therefore the reward of good folke: is to be made goddes, whiche rewarde,
no daye consumeth, no power $diminissheth {TEXT:dimnissheth} , and no
wickednes defaceth.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.428

And synce it is thus that good folke neuer fayle of reward, then a
wyse man may not doughte of the contynuall and inseperable payne of
wycked folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.429

For when that good and euyll, payne and rewarde, be contrarye one to
another, then the things that we se to happen as a rewarde of good,
the same thynges beyng contrarye must nedes be the ponyshmente of the
euyll folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.430

For as goodnes is the rewarde of good folke, soo wyckednes is the
ponyshmente of wicked folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.431

Nowe certes whosoeuer is tormentid with ponyshment, there is no dought
but that he is tormented wyth euyll.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.432

Therefore if the same euyll folke will esteme and praise themselfe,
may they seme to be without ponishme~t: which euyl folke not onely
extreme wyckednes of all euyll trobleth, but also corrupteth vehemently.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.433

And se also of the contrarye part of the good folke, what payne folowethe
the wycked folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.434

For thou hast lerned a litle before that euery thyng that is, is one.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.435

And the same one, is good, BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.436

so the consequence to the same is, that euery thing that is certes the
same semethe to be good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,96.437

Therefore by this means, what soeuer thynge fayleth and is <P_97> not
good, it cessyth to be, or it is not.  Whereby it comethe to passe that
euyll folke cesseth to be the same that they were.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.438

But the same other fourme of manes body sheweth yet that wycked folke ,
haue bene men, and certes beyng turnyd into malyce or wyckednes, they
haue lost the nature of man.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.439

But whe~ that goodnes onely may exalte euerye man aboue the nature of men
: It must nedes be, that wycked folke <paren> whose wyckednes hath cast
them oute from the condicion of man <$$paren> do put them vnder the merite
of man or cause them to be lesse estemed then men.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.440

Therefore it happeth that if thou seist anye man turned into vices or
wickednes, thou mayst not thinke that he is a man.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.441

If any man brenneth in couitous and is a violent extorcioner or rauener
of other mennes goodes, thou mayst saye that he is lyke a woulfe.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.442

And if a man be cruel, and troubelous, and exercyseth hys tounge with
chydyng he may be lykened to a dogge.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.443

Also he that is a pryuye lyer in a waye, and reioyseth to stele by
craft and soteltie, he may be compared to yong foxes, or yong coubbes.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.444

And a man that is distempryd, and wexeth wode for anger, it semeth that
he do beare the stomake of a lyon.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.445

If a man be fearefull and fleynge, and feareth thynges that he ought
not to fere he is counted lyke vnto hertes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.446

And if a man be slow, astonyed and waxethe dull, he lyueth as an asse.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.447

If a man be lyght inconstant and often chaungeth his mynd and thought,
he differith no thynge from byrdes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.448

And he that is drowned in foule and fylthy plesures, of lechery, is
wrapped in the delight of the fylthy sow or hogge.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.449

So then it foloweth, that he that forsaketh his goodnes, is no man.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,97.450

And when he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} passe and turne into the
condytyon of God, he is turnyd by his wycked condicions into a beste.

BOECIUS.  By this I do perceyue what felycytie, or blyssednes is in the
desertes of good folke, and of wycked folk.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,103.454

But in this commen fortune of the people, I doo conceyue that therein
is some good or euyll.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,103.455

For no wise man hadde leuer be a banisshed manne, nedye, poore, and
shamefull: then to be full of riches, reuerende <P_104> in honoure,
stronge in power, and to dwell styll in his Cytie, and florysshe in welth.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.456

So certes after this maner, that is to say: by riches honour and power
, the offyce of a wyse man, is estemed more clere, and more assured of
wysdom, then when felycytie or blyssednes of gouernours or rulers, is
scatered or deuyded, as it were emonges the comme~ people next adioynynge
as subiectes.  Sythe that namely pryson, lawe, and other tormentes of
lawefull paynes, do rather appertayne vnto myschiuous cytisens for whome
they were ordeyned, then for good folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.457

Therfore I do greatly maruayle, why these thynges folowyng be turnyd
clene contrarye, that is to saye: that ponyshmentes of wycked folke,
do oppresse good folke.  And that the wycked folke, do beare awaye the
rewardes of vertue, that is to say, why they be exalted to honor and
$high {TEXT:his} estate.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.458

And I desyre to lerne of the what thou thynkeste to be the reason of
suche a wrongfull confusion.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.459

For I woulde lesse meruail yf that I thought that al thynges were myngyd
together with chaunce of fortune.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.460

But now God the gouernoure of all thynges incresethe my meruaylynge,
syth that he geueth often tymes plesaunt thynges to good folke, and
sharpe thynges to euil folk: and contraryewyse he geuethe harde thynges
to good folke, and to wycked folke theyr desyres, except the cause be
knowen what difference is betwene goddes doynges, and fortunes chaunces.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.461

PHILOSO. It is no meruayle at all thoughe people thinketh that
there is somethinge folishe and confuse {COM:sic}, when the reason of
Gods ordynaunce is not knowen.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,104.462

But althoughe thou knowest not the cause of so grete a disposition,
yet doute thou not but all thynges be well gouerned, for asmuche as
god the good gouernor, attempereth and gouerneth the world vnyuersall.

<P_113>

PHILOSOPHYE.  Seist thou not nowe what foloweth all these thynges that
I haue sayd?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,113.466

BOE. I say what thinge foloweth?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,113.467

PHI. All fortune is good without dout.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,113.468

BOE. And how can it be soo.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,113.469

PHI. Vnderstande thus, that all fortune whether it be good or
<P_114> euyll is geuen either to rewarde or exercyse good folke, or for
thintente to ponyshe and correcte euyll folke.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.470

And so all fortune is good that appereth eyther to be iuste or profytable.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.471

BOE. I saye it is a verye true reason.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.472

And yf I do consider the prouidence of god, or destinye whych thou
taughtest a lytle before, thy sentence is knyt together with stronge
resons.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.473

But let vs <paren> if it please the <$$paren> nomber this opinion or
sentence, emongest those thynges that thou diddest allege a lytle before ,
were not to be thought of any man.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.474

PHI. And wherefore.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.475

BOE. For that the commen speche of men dothe muche mystake the
talke of fortune, saying often that some mens fortune is very euyll.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.476

PHI. Wylt thou therefore that I returne a lytle to the speche of
the commen people, so that I seme not to digresse ouermuch from the vse
of the people.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.477

BOE. I saye do as it shall please the.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.478

PHI. Dost thou not iudge all thyng good that profyteth.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.479

BOE. Yes.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.480

P. The fortune that dothe exercyse or correct, doth good.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.481

BOE. I saye I graunt the same.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.482

PHI. Then is al fortune good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.483

BOE. What ells?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.484

PHILOSO. But this fortune that exerciseth, is the fortune of such
that be sette in vertue and do stryue agaynst vyce: BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.485

but fortune that correcteth, is of suche that declyning from vyce,
do chose and take the way of vertue.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.486

BOE. I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} denye it.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.487

PHILOSOPHI.  But what sayest thou, of plesaunte fortune, that is geuen
to good folke for rewarde, BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.488

doo the comme~ people iudge the same wicked fortune?
BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.489

BOE. No truelye, BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.490

but iudgeth it good, as it is in dede.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.491

P. What sayest thou of the other fortune that is euyll and sharpe,
and restrayneth wicked folke by iuste ponyshment, BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.492

do the commen people esteme it good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.493

BOE. I saye that they do iudge the same most wretched of all
thynges that maye be thoughte.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.494

PHI. Take hede therefore lest that we folowynge the opinion of
the commen people, haue not concluded a thyng gretely, not to be thought
of them.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.495

BOE. What is that.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.496

P. Certes of these thinges that are graunted it fortuneth that of
them that be other in professing of vertue, or in thencrease of vertue ,
or in optayning of vertue, al maner of fortune <paren> what souer it be
<$$paren> is good.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.497

But all maner of fortune is euell to them that remayne in wickednes
, whych thing the commen people do not so iudge and take it.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.498

BOE. That is true, although no man dare confesse the truth
there of.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.499

PHI. Why so?  BOETHCO-E1-P2,114.500

A wyse man ought not to be greued, whe~ misfortune happeth no more then
a strong man {COM:ought} to disdaine or to be moued <P_115> with angre,
when alarum or tumult of warre ryseth.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.501

For to bothe, the same difficultie to stryue agaynst fortune, is the
matter, that is to saye: to the one whych is the strong man it is a
cause to optayne $renown {TEXT:renome}, BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.502

to the other, which is the wyse man, it is a cause to confyrme hys
wisedom or vertue.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.503

For therefore it is called vertue, by cause it, stryuing agaynst
vice, with all force, is not ouercome wyth vyce or aduersitie.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.504

Nor certes you that be set in the increase or waye of vertue haue not
come to abounde in pleasurs and to continue in lustes of the fleshe.
BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.505

For then you do sowe and plant a verye sharpe conflyct or battell,
with all fortune.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.506

Therfore lest that eyther wicked fortune opppresse you, or good fortune
corrupte and hurte you, hold you the meane betwene both with fyrme,
and stedefast power and strength.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.507

For certes al that is vnder the mene vertu or passeth the meane vertue,
dispiseth vertue, BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.508

or is vicious, BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.509

and hath no rewarde of his trauell or laboure.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.510

For it lyeth in your owne power, what fortune you had leuer haue, that
is to sai: to take what fortune ye wyll.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.511

For all fortune that semeth sharpe or euyll <paren> yf it do not exercyse
the good folke, or correct and chastyce the wicked folke <$$paren>
it greueth or ponysheth.  BOETHCO-E1-P2,115.512
