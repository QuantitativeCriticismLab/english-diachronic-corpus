Honored Cosen, I must returne you many thanks for the great payns
and care, you have bene pleased to take in my sonne's bisnes.
ZOUCH-E3-P2,158.4

You will now continue with the seame sealle {COM:zeal} or greter in his
behalfe, by reason of that neerre relacond which you mention in youer
letter, wherin hee hath ioyned himsellfe on to you: ZOUCH-E3-P2,158.5

the first intellegenc therof I did reseve from youeresellfe; whereof I
confes somewhat strange and onexpected to mee; ZOUCH-E3-P2,158.6

butt now, though I $can $not {TEXT:canot} bee unsensible that hee
hath furgotten mee his mother in not takeng my advise in a meatter of
that weight, yet I am $glad that hee heath not furgutten himsellfe in
his Choyce, haveing matched with a daughter of youers whose worth and
abilityes I knowe so well, as that you are able with ease to assiste him
and goe thorwgh in the recovery of his esteate which I confes <P_159> was
a taske somewhat to heard and very inproper for a weake woman; wherin I
shall still doo the outmost that shall ley in my power.  ZOUCH-E3-P2,159.7

But good Cosin I am confident you are so ingenuous and of so much
iudgement as theat you will not conceive I can soppose my husband shulld
expend his esteat for a sonne in Leaw, having one of his owen, which I
doubt not you will take into so serious consideracon as to afforde all
faitherly care and affection towards him who is now made $your $sonne by
a decre, as you write very truely, not to be prevented: ZOUCH-E3-P2,159.8

and for my sellfe I shall never be wanting as fare as I am able to
performe the part of a mother, ZOUCH-E3-P2,159.9

and for the present shall conclude, by youer owen good exampele,
with my prayers that all blessings meay bee multyplyed opon thim both,
which shall allways bee the fervent desier of her that is, worthy Cosin,
Youer afacnat kinwomen and sister Zowch ZOUCH-E3-P2,159.10
