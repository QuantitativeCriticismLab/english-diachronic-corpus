I am very glad to heare y=r= Losp. and all y=e= company gott so
well to Maidwell, w=ch= I was so forgetfull not to thinke you were there
but sent my letter to Kirby, w=ch= made it longer before it gott to you.

My L=d= Finch has writ a letter to my sister Betty, w=ch= I hope she
has recievid.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.5

Hear is a most dismal story of my L=d= Salisberys two brothers who he
sent into France.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.6

They were at St. Germains, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.7

and lay in a room together ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.8

and quarreld, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.9

$'t $is {TEXT:tis} not yet known for what, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.10

but rise out of bed ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.11

and tooke there swords, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.12

and fought, tell they both fell dwone, w=ch= was heared in {the} room
under them.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.13

They that were there run up to there chamber door, w=ch= they found
fastend, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.14

but, forcing it open, found them weltring in thier blood and craling to
ask one another pardon.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.15

$'T $is {TEXT:Tis} sayed there was little hopes that either could recover.
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,162.16

Some letters say the eldest was already dead, tho <P_2,163> wone $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} say this is certain; ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,163.17

there are so manny letters that speake of it y=t= there relations are
fearfull it is too true.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,163.18

S=r= Edward Villars is to be a Viscount, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,163.19

but wither English or no I $can $n't {TEXT:cant} tell.
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,163.20

my Lady.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,163.21

I am y=r= Losp. most obedient duttyfull daughter, A.

Y=e= 31 of De., $1694.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.25

My Lord, The sad confirmation last nights letters brought me of
the death of my most deare mistress, the Queen, gives me so just an
affliction that I am but little thoughtfull of my neerest concerns.
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.26

The want of coach horses has, since my Lords going, hinderd me from
waitting of y=r= Losp., and the news this last week of her illness
from sending to know how you did.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.27

God has been pleased to shorten her days as a reward of her sufferings,
w=ch= in this world were not slight, w=ch=, w=th= the goodness of her
owne nature, had formed in her so great a degree of vertu, it might
truely be sayd the world was not worthy of her.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.28

A poore lamentation is all the gratitude that can be payd her now for
that favor so undeservedly she bestowed on me, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.29

is all that now can be returned by, my Lord, Y=r= most obedient, duttyfull
daughter, A. Nottingham.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.30

Twelfth Day, $1695.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.32

My Lord, My Lord Nottingham has so great a share in this loss
himself, that his owne affliction makes him apprehend mine.
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,209.33

I must be <P_2,210> excesively ungratefull to that incompareable Princess
, to be unconcerned that she is gone; and yet more ungratefull to God
, to be insensible of those many blessings he still continues to me.
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.34

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} express myself better upon this sad occasion
then as the Dean of Pauls has already done: ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.35

We must be dumb and not open our mouths, because God did it.
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.36

I have obeyed y=r= Losp. commands to the two Lady Marys, who give
you their humble service and hope I shall return from London so soon,
they may w=th= me waitt of you.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.37

I should have been very glad to have waitted of you as I went up,
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.38

but my coachman tells $'t $is {TEXT:tis} much the worse way,
ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.39

and, I confess, upon this occasion I am desirous to have as few delays
as I can in that performance of my poore remaining dutty to my deare
mistress.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.40

Essex I thinke to take w=th= me, ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.41

and the others have not yet got there mourning.  ANHATTON-E3-P2,2,210.42

At my return I hope they may waitt of you, w=th= y=r= Losp.
most obedient, duttyfull daughter, A. Nottingham.
