<P_201>

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> Yea, my Lord, you had three hundred
Men in Arms in your House; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.2

why did you not dissolve them, being commanded upon your Allegiance from
the Queen to do it?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.3

<font> Essex.  <$$font> They hearing rumours of Men about my House
against them put them into such a Fear and Extasy, that it was not
in my power suddenly to dissolve them, or to quench their Passions;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.4

and the rather, for that Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> desired Sir
<font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> to leave their Company, or else they
would all be lost; so that they stood amazed, and knew not what to do.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.5

<font> Southampton.  <$$font> Mr. Attorney, you speak all this
as if it were as true as Gospel.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.6

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Good my Lord, let me intreat you to mark the
Circumstances: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.7

Word was brought that Men were sent for into the Country, to take us in
our own Houses; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.8

then we conceiving the thirsty Appetite of our private guard Enemies,
took our selves to our Arms, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.9

and were glad to stand upon our guard for our own Defence.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.10

But as for the Lords of the Council that came to my House, we being
before advertised that we should be beset, thought it the securest way
for those of the Council to keep them there, not knowing what Mischief
would ensue.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.11

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> My Lord, your Grace sees that this
is without Colour or Question; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.12

for my Lord Chief Justice had proved it plain, that they would not
dissolve their Company that was up in Arms, being charged upon their
Allegiance so to do.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.13

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Good my Lord, know whether it were in my Lord
of <font> Southampton <$$font>'s power or in mine to withhold their
Purposes so suddenly: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.14

For, not long before Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> had sent to my
House to have Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> come to him to <font>
Durham-House <$$font>; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.15

and we fearing him to be a private Enemy, would not suffer Sir <font>
Ferdinando <$$font> to go thither, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.16

but returned answer, that he would meet him on the Water upon equal Terms
: where Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font> used the former Speeches to
Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font>, wishing him to leave our Company,
or else he would be undone.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.17

And whereas we are charged to have dealt with Papists, I assure your
Lordship, and it is most true, that Papists have been hired and suborned
to witness against me; as by the means of one <font> Sudall <$$font>,
who was a Seminary Priest, and sent into <font> Ireland <$$font> to deal
with Sir <font> Christopher Blunt <$$font>, whom he thought to be inward
with me, to touch my Honour and Reputation.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.18

Then <font> Bales <$$font>, the Scrivener in the <font> Old Baily
<$$font>, hath confessed under his hand to forge and counterfeit my Hand
in at least two Letters; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.19

and these two honest Gentlemen can witness it.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.20

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> Ay, by my troth this is true,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.21

but it was by the Procurement of one of your own Men.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.22

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Thou swearest it, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.23

but it is not on a Book; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.24

that Man thou sayest I procured to do it, his name is <font> John Daniel
<$$font>, an arrant Thief, one that broke a Standard of mine, and stole
a Casket of my Wife's, and many other things.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.25

It is very probable that I should trust him so far, that had before
betrayed me, is it not?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.26

But it is well known who set him at work to attempt against me
so much as he hath done, to procure my hand to be counterfeited;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.27

and yet this Man, by your Judgment, must be a Practiser in such Matters
by my own Consent.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.28

Well, Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>, I thank God you are not my
Judge this Day, you are so uncharitable.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.29

<font> Attorney Gen. <$$font> Well, my Lord, we shall prove you
anon what you are, which your Pride of Heart, and aspiring Mind, hath
brought you unto.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.30

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Ah!  Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>, lay
your Hand upon your Heart, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.31

and pray to God to forgive us both.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.32

<font> Raleigh.  <$$font> That Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font>
told me upon the Water, that my Lord of <font> Essex.  <$$font> had put
himself into a strong Guard at <font> Essex-House <$$font>, and this is
like to be the bloodiest day's work that ever was, wishing him to go to
Court with speed for prevention thereof: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.33

Then Sir <font> Walter <$$font> wished Sir <font> Ferdinando
Gorges <$$font> to refuse their Company, else he would be undone.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.34

To this Sir <font> Walter <$$font> was sworn.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.35

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Whatsoever Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
hath said, differeth altogether from that which Sir <font> Ferdinando
Gorges <$$font> told us at <font> Essex-House <$$font>, upon his return
from the Water.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.36

<font> Attorn. Gen. <$$font> Well, my Lord, what can
you devise to say for Sir <font> John Davis <$$font>, another of your
Adherents, that Papist?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.37

for he hath confessed that he is a Papist and a Catholick, and drawn in by
Sir <font> Christopher Blount <$$font>, one of your chiefest Counsel, and
that he called for a Seminary Priest upon his Convertment to absolve him.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,201.38

<font> Essex.  <$$font> If Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> were such a
Man, it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be but strange to <P_202> me to hear it;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.39

altho'I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} search into the Secrets of his Heart
to accuse him inwardly, yet I have seen him dutifully come to Prayers,
and to the Service of God in my own House with me, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.40

and behaved himself very godlily; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.41

and of this I can be witness.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.42

And as for <font> Blunt <$$font> <paren> God is my Witness <$$paren>
I have been so far from Popery, as I have so earnestly dealt with him
to reform himself, insomuch that he hath told me, I have been very
passionate.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.43

But whereas you say, we have committed Treason, first prove that true.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.44

<font> Serjeant Yelvert. <$$font> Why, my Lord, if you deny the
raising the Power, why should so many Men come to your House that day?
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.45

<font> Southampton.  <$$font> By your favour, Mr. Serjeant <font>
Yelverton <$$font>, a word, I hope; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.46

for my coming thither, it was not strange news; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.47

and when I came that same morning to <font> Essex-House <$$font>,
I protest I had not above ten or twelve men attending me, which was
but my usual Company, therefore far from purposing to raise a Tumult.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.48

<font> Attorn. Gen. <$$font> Why, the reason of that was ,
for that you thought all <font> London <$$font> would have risen with
you; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.49

but, good my Lord, I beseech your Grace to hear the Oath of
Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges: <$$font> whose Evidence was read,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.50

and himself there in person did justify the same.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.51

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Ferdinando Gorges <font> his Confession.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.53

<$$heading>

He deposeth, That in <font> January <$$font> last the Earl of <font>
Essex <$$font> wrote to him a Letter, wherein he complained grievously
of his Misfortunes, and the miserable Estate he stood in, whereof he
purposed shortly to free himself, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.55

and therefore prayed Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> to come up
to <font> London <$$font> to him: who coming accordingly, the Earl told
him how mightily he was crossed and discredited by his private Enemies,
which he could not endure; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.56

for, saith he, I have 120 Earls, Barons, and Gentlemen, that participate
in my discontented Humour, and will join with me, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.57

and I desire your Help and Counsel therein.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.58

One special Friend I have in the Court, whereby I have intelligence from
time to time: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.59

And I hold our selves indifferently affected by the Citizens of <font>
London <$$font>, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.60

and hope to have a good Party in <font> Wales <$$font>.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.61

He confessed also, that they had two several Meetings at <font>
Drury-House <$$font>, to consult of these Matters; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.62

and the Projects were, Whether it were better first to surprize the Court,
or to take the Tower of <font> London <$$font>, or to stir in the City.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.63

But most agreed, first to surprize the Court.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.64

And then and there Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> took Pen, Ink, and
Paper, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.65

and set down, That some should keep the Hall, some the Court-Gates,
some the Guard-Chamber, and some the Presence-Chamber; saying, many
of the Guard had been the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>'s Servants,
and were preferred to the Queen by him, and will be more indifferent to
deal with than others; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.66

and so my Lord shall have a way thro'his own Guards to come to the
Privy-Chamber, and the Presence of the Queen.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.67

And Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> said to the Earl of <font>
Essex <$$font>, Alas!  My Lord, what is so small a number of Men able
to do in so worthy an Action?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.68

and so dissuaded the Earl from surprizing the Court,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.69

and rather bade him submit himself to the Queen's Mercy, than proceed
any further.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.70

And that the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font> said at <font>
Essex-House <$$font>, Is it not three months since this Plot began,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.71

and shall we resolve on nothing?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.72

Then upon a sudden they all agreed, first to stir in <font>
London <$$font>, where they assured themselves of great Favour:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.73

And after the Council was lock'd up, this Deponent followed the Troops
into <font> London <$$font>; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.74

and after some advice the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> sent him
back again with a Token to deliver to the Lord Chief Justice only, by
colour of which Token he set at liberty the Lord Keeper and the rest.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.75

Lastly, he confirmed, that he told Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>
first, upon the <font> Thames <$$font>, of my Lord of <font> Essex
<$$font>'s making his House a Guard, and putting his Friends into
Arms, as it is delivered by Sir <font> Walter Raleigh <$$font>.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.76

<font> Queen's Counsel.  <$$font> We desire, that the Examination of Sir
<font> Charles Davers <$$font> may be read; <font> which being produced,
was then read to this effect: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.77

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Charles Davers's <font> Examination.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.79

<$$heading>

He confesseth, That before <font> Christmas <$$font> last the Earl of
<font> Essex <$$font> entred into Consideration, how he might secure
himself to have access to the Queen's Presence without Resistance; and
that the Resolution was agreeable to certain Articles written with the
Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>'s own Hand, and sent to the Earl of <font>
Southampton <$$font> to surpize the Court; and that there were divers
Consultations about it, and the Points were these: First, to take the
<font> Tower <$$font>, for it would command <font> London <$$font>, then
to surprise the Court; and after, the Court being taken and possessed,
to have assembled the rest of their Friends, and to have presented
themselves to the Queen: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.81

and that being done, and the Guards secured, Sir <font> Christopher
Blount <$$font> should keep the outward Gates of the Court, Sir <font>
John Davis <$$font> the Hall and Water-gate, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.82

Sir <font> Charles Davers <$$font> <paren> this Deponent <$$paren>
should keep the Presence and Guard-Chamber, and seize upon the Halberts
and Pensioners Battle-Axes.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.83

The Intent was to surprize the Captain of the Guard at the Court,
or at his own House, and some others; and then to surprize the Tower
of <font> London: <$$font> And that the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>
resolved <paren> these things being accomplished <$$paren> immediately
to have called a Parliament to reform Disorders and private Grievances.
That this Deponent utterly disliked of these Courses; and after the
Alarm was given at Court, he persuaded the Earl rather to flee into
<font> Wales <$$font>, or other parts beyond the Seas for his Security,
and avoiding the imminent Danger he was fallen into, than to trust to
the City.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.84

And lastly, he protested, for his own part, what he had done in
the business, was merely for the Love he bore to the Earl of <font>
Southampton.  <$$font>, and not for any Malice or private Discontent
otherwise.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.85

When this was read, Mr. <font> Attorney General <$$font> produced
the Examination of Sir <font> John Davis <$$font>, which contained in
effect as follows: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.86

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> John Davis's <font> Examination.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,202.88

<$$heading>

He saith, That the Earl's Purpose was, to possess himself of the Court
, and to take the Tower of <font> London <$$font>; and that they had
several <P_203> Meetings of Consultation, together with the Earl of
<font> Southampton <$$font>, Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges, Jo.
Littleton <$$font>, Sir <font> Christopher Blount <$$font>, Sir <font>
Charles Davers <$$font>, and this Deponent.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.90

And these Matters <paren> he confesseth <$$paren> the Earl of <font> Essex
<$$font> set down all with his own Hand, <font> viz. <$$font> Sir
<font> Christopher Blount <$$font> to keep the outward Gate of the Court
himself, this Deponent the Hall and Water-gate, and Sir <font> Charles
Davers <$$font> the Presence and Guard-Chamber; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.91

then my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> and his Forces would have
come by Land, and so have possessed the Presence of the Queen.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.92

The question was asked the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> <paren> as
this Deponent saith <$$paren>, How he would deal with Offenders, and
such as resisted him, after he should be possessed of these things?
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.93

He resolved them by way of Answer, That he meant to admit them all to
an honourable Trial.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.94

Then was produced the Confession of Sir <font> Christopher Blount <$$font>
, which was as follows.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.95

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Christopher Blunt's <font> Examination.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.97

<$$heading>

He confesseth that the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> sent <font> Wiseman
<$$font>, about the 20th of <font> January <$$font>, to visit his Wife
with Letters of Compliment, and to require him to come up unto him to
<font> London <$$font>, to settle his Estate according as he had written
unto him before some few days.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.99

Being demanded to what End they went to the City, to join with such
strength as they hoped for there; he confesseth, it was to secure the
Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>'s Life, against such Forces as should be
sent against him.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.100

And being asked, What, against the Queen's Forces?  he answered, That
must have been judged afterwards.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.101

But being further asked, Whether he did advise to come unto the Court
over Night?  he saith, No; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.102

for Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges <$$font> did assure, that the
Alarum was taken of it at the Court, and the Guards doubled.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.103

Being asked, Whether he thought any Prince could have endured to have any
Subject make the City his Mediator?  or, to gather force to speak for him?
he saith, He is not read in stories of former times; but he doth not know,
but that in former times Subjects have used Force for their mediation.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.104

Being asked, What should have been done by any of the Persons that should
have been removed from the Queen?  he answer'd, That he never found my
Lord disposed to shed Blood; but that any that should have been found,
should have had indifferent Trial.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.105

Being asked upon his Conscience, Whether the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>
did not give him Comfort, that if he came to Authority, there should be
a Toleration for Religion?  he confesseth, he should have been to blame
to have denied it.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.106

<font> Counsel.  <$$font> There is another Examination of Sir <font>
Christopher Blount <$$font>'s; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.107

I pray let that be read.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.108

<heading>

<font> Sir <$$font> Christopher Blunt's <font> second Examination.
<$$font> ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.110

<$$heading>

He saith, That four or five days before the Insurrection in <font>
London <$$font>, the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> set down divers
Articles with his own Hand, with Petitions to the Earl of <font>
Southampton <$$font>, Sir <font> Charles Davers <$$font>, Sir <font>
John Davis <$$font>, Sir <font> Ferdinando Gorges, Jo. Littleton
<$$font> , and this Deponent; which were to the effect before remembered.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.112

And further this Deponent remembereth, That the Earl of <font>
Essex <$$font>'s Purpose was <paren> after these things should be
over-passed and settled <$$paren> to alter the State of Government:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.113

And further this Deponent confesseth himself to be reconciled to the
Pope: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.114

And moreover saith, that the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> said, He looked
not that any should be troubled for Religion, and Liberty of Conscience;
that he received Letters from the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> the
20th of <font> January <$$font>, to come to <font> London <$$font>,
whereupon he came.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.115

<heading>

<font> The Earl of <$$font> Rutland's <font> Examination.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.117

<$$heading>

He saith, That being in <font> London <$$font>, with the Earl of
<font> Essex <$$font>, he heard him cry out in the Streets, <font>
England <$$font> is bought and sold to the <font> Spaniard: <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.119

and confesseth, when they had been possessed of <font> London <$$font>,
their Purpose was to have taken the Lord Keeper with them to the Court,
with the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>'s Company; and that the Earl of
<font> Southampton <$$font> and Sir <font> John Davis <$$font> were in
special Confederacy and Trust with the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>
in these Causes.  Lastly, That the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> said,
he was sure of Sheriff <font> Smith: <$$font> ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.120

and this Deponent specially noted, the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font>
was very much discontented.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.121

<heading>

<font> Lord <$$font> Cromwel's <font> Examination.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.123

<$$heading>

He saith, He never heard of the Matter till the same Sunday-morning,
when the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> coming thro'<font> Fleet-street
<$$font>, where this Deponent lay, and being sent for by a Man of my
Lord's, he came into the Street to him; where my Lord and divers of his
Followers took him by the Hand, and bade him welcome, praying him to go
along with him; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.125

and the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> cried, It is for the good of the
Queen, and of you all, my Masters.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.126

First, he went to the Mayor's House, and then to Sheriff <font> Smith's
<$$font> House; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.127

and being in <font> Grace-Church-Street <$$font>, and hearing of the
Proclamation, the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> said, Where is the
Sheriff?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.128

Let him bring Muskets and Pistols; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.129

for I am credibly informed out of <font> Ireland <$$font>, that the
Kingdom of <font> England <$$font> is sold to the <font> Spaniard
<$$font>.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.130

And so upon the Proclamation the Deponent left him and his Company.

and coming to <font> Essex-House <$$font>, he found then but a few there:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.136

but in a short time after, came the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font>
with the rest.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.137

This Deponent agreeth in divers other Circumstances with former
Examinations: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.138

He confesseth, he went with the Earl into <font> London <$$font>, and
came back with him to <font> Ludgate <$$font>; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.139

and there being repulsed, he heard my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> cry,
Charge, charge!  and call for his Horse.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.140

And he saith, that Sheriff <font> Smith <$$font> was as far in the Matter
as the best of them.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.141

<font> Mr. Attorney.  <$$font> Here Mr. <font> Attorney
<$$font> urged, that there was a Combination; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.142

and one <font> Pashell <$$font> affirm'd the burning of a black
Purse by the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>, which my Lord confesseth;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.143

but saith, that there was nothing in it, but a Key of an Iron-Chest,
which he took out, and burnt a Paper in the same Purse, which did not
contain above five or six Lines of secret Matter: and, for that he would
not have so much as their Names drawn into question, which were altogether
ignorant of these Occurrents, did throw the Purse and Paper into the Fire.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,203.144

And also <font> Pashell <$$font> confesseth further, that when the Earl
of <font> Essex <$$font> came out of <font> London <$$font> to his House,

but confesseth, <P_204> he followed the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font>
down <font> Fleet-street <$$font>, intending to go to the Mayor, and so
to his House in <font> Seething-Lane <$$font>.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.150

And this Deponent being with the Earl of <font> Essex <$$font> in
<font> Grace-Church-Street <$$font>, confesseth he did hear the Earl
<paren> when the Lord <font> Burleigh <$$font> came with the Herald at
Arms <$$paren> command some of his Followers to bid the Herald stay,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.151

for he would not hear him abuse the Queen's Name.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.152

He saith also, he went back with the Earl to <font> Ludgate <$$font>
, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.153

and they were repulsed.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.154

<font> Mr. Attorney <$$font>.  Now, my Lord, I beseech your
Grace, and you, my Lords, that be the Peers, let the due Consideration
of these several Examinations and Depositions enter into your Hearts;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.155

and do but note, they have all agreed and jumped together in each
particular point, notwithstanding they were all severally examined:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.156

but I must needs think it the just Judgment of God, in his mere Mercy
towards our Sovereign, to have the Truth so marvellously reveal'd; coming
from them of their own accords, without Rack or Torture to any of them.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.157

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>, I answer,
then, this for that point; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.158

The self-same Fear, and the self-same Examiner, may make these
several Examinations agree all in one, were they never so far distant;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.159

but, good my Lord, let me intreat your Lordship to consider who they be
that testify this against me: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.160

My Lord, they are Men within the Danger of the Law, and such as speak
with a desire to live; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.161

but I think they have much to answer for between God and their Souls
and me.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.162

I see they charge me with the surprizing of the <font> Tower <$$font>
; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.163

but upon what ground do they speak?  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.164

They had only some particular Notes of my Friends Names,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.165

but ever very scornfully dashed at me; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.166

for when my Friends persuaded me to any course, this was my purpose,
to have come with eight or nine honourable Persons, who had just Cause
of Discontentment <paren> tho'not equal with mine <$$paren> unto her
Majesty, and so by Petition, prostrating our selves at her Majesty's feet,
to have put our selves unto her Mercy.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.167

And the Effect of our Desires should have been, that she would have been
pleased to have sever'd some from her Majesty, who, by reason of their
Potency with her, abused her Majesty's Ears with false Informations;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.168

and they were <font> Cobham, Cecil <$$font>, and <font> Raleigh: <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.169

For we {COM:sic} thought my Lord <font> Cobham <$$font> carried himself
in such factious and dangerous Courses, as he told her Majesty many
Untruths; which was a principal Cause <paren> as I think <$$paren>
of withdrawing her Favour from us.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.170

And to that intent, to remove such from her Highness <paren> I confess
<$$paren> was the only desire we had to present our selves in all Humility
before her Majesty, but without any purpose of Hurt to her Highness:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.171

for, I protest before God, I do carry as reverent and loyal Duty to her
Majesty, as any Man in the World.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.172

But now, my Lord, seeing that I have heard the Testimony of Sir <font>
Ferdinando Gorges <$$font>, and himself here in Court to testify it,
I will say no more, but that if it please her Majesty to be merciful
unto him, I will be glad, and pray for it; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.173

yet whatsoever he hath said, let my Life and his Dealing testify the
Truth: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.174

and, Sir <font> Ferdinando <$$font>, speak nothing to touch thy self,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.175

and speak what thou wilt to me; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.176

for I see thou desirest to live, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.177

yet speak like a Man.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.178

<font> Lord Admiral.  <$$font> I desire, for the better Satisfaction
of my self and Fellow-Peers, that <font> Gorges <$$font> might unfold
openly what other Secrets have passed between him and my Lord of <font>
Essex <$$font>, touching the State.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.179

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Ah!  my Lord Admiral, assure your self, in faith,
no Treason: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.180

But yet, I pray thee, good Sir <font> Ferdinando <$$font>, speak openly
whatsoever thou dost remember; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.181

and with all my heart I desire thee to speak freely.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.182

<font> Gorges.  <$$font> All that I can remember, I have deliver'd in
my Examination; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.183

and further, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} say.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.184

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Yes, <font> Ferdinando <$$font>, if ever you knew
any other Matter, which contained any Thought of Treason or Disloyalty,
speak it; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.185

for they are things not to be forgotten.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.186

<font> Southampton.  <$$font> Good Sir <font> Ferdinando <$$font>
, satisfy the Court what was intended among all our Conferences,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.187

and Talk of our Enemies, and Discontentments, and Consultations
, and what was our best Course for our Defence against them.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.188

<font> Gorges.  <$$font> Some delivered their Minds one way, some another;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.189

but, by the Oath I have taken, I did never know or hear any Thought or
Purpose of Hurt or Disloyalty intended to her Majesty's Person by my
Lord of <font> Essex.  <$$font> ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.190

<font> Lord Admiral.  <$$font> I desire to know, for the better
Satisfaction of my Conscience, whether my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font>
did at any time deliver out any Articles in writing under his hand,
therein laying open the Projects of his Purpose for surprizing the Court
and <font> Tower <$$font>.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.191

<font> Southampton.  <$$font> It was a foolish Action, I must needs
confess, the going thro'the Town, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.192

and that was suddenly passed over: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.193

But my Lord's purpose to have Men planted at the Court, was in regard
he feared hindrance by private Enemies, that would have stopped his
Passage to the Queen; which, I protest, he intended to no other end,
but to prostrate himself at her Majesty's feet, and submit to her Mercy,
as ye have formerly heard.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.194

<font> Cobham.  <$$font> My Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> <paren> quoth
the Lord <font> Cobham <$$font>, standing up <$$paren>, let me know, I
intreat you, why you lay such Imputations upon me, as you have deliver'd.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.195

<font> Essex.  <$$font> My Lord, I have forgiven all the World,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.196

and therefore you shall not need to insist upon these Circumstances;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.197

for I lay not my Cause upon aught that shall do your Lordship any harm
for my sake: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.198

For, I protest, my Heart bears you no Malice, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.199

but what I spake was freely, and in God's presence, hoping her
Majesty would have heard us, and our Complaints being true.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.200

And I do further assure your Lordship, that I never spake it out of fear
of Death, or desire of Life.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.201

<font> Bacon.  <$$font> My Lord, may it please your Grace, whatsoever my
Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> hath here denied, in my conceit it seemeth
to be small.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.202

I speak not to any ordinary Jury, but to prudent, grave and wise Peers :
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.203

And this I must needs say, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.204

It is evident that you, my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font>, had planted
a Pretence in your Hearts against the Government; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.205

and now, under colour of excuse, you must lay the Cause upon particular
Enemies.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.206

You put me in remembrance of one <font> Pisistratus <$$font>, that was
come into a City, and doting upon the Affections of the Citizens unto
him <paren> he having a purpose to procure the Subversion of a Kingdom,
and wanting Aid for the accomplishing his Humour <$$paren> thought it
the surest means for the winning of the Hearts of the Citizens unto him
, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.207

and so in that hope he entered the City, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.208

and cut his Body over-thwart, to the end they might conjecture he had
been in danger: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.209

and so by this means held the same Conceit as you and your Complices did;
entering the City of <font> London <$$font>, persuading your selves, if
they had undertaken your Cause, all would have gone well on your side.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.210

And now, my Lord, all you have said, or can say, in answer to these
Matters, are but Shadows; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,204.211

and <P_205> therefore, $me $thinks {TEXT:methinks}, it were your best
course to confess, and not to justify.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.212

<font> Essex.  <$$font> May it please your Lordship, I must produce
Mr. <font> Bacon <$$font> for a Witness; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.213

for when the Course of private Persecution was in hand, and most assail'd
me, then Mr. <font> Bacon <$$font> was the Man that proffer'd me
Means to the Queen, and drew a Letter in my name, and in his Brother Sir
<font> Nicholas Bacon <$$font>'s name; which Letter he purposed to shew
the Queen, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.214

and <font> Gosnal <$$font> was the Man that brought them unto me: wherein
I did see Mr. <font> Bacon <$$font>'s Hand pleaded as orderly,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.215

and appointed them out that were my Enemies, as directly as might be.
Which Letters I know Mr. Secretary <font> Cecil <$$font> hath
seen, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.216

and by him it will appear what Conceit he held of me, and no
otherwise than he here coloureth and pleadeth the contrary.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.217

<font> Bacon.  <$$font> My Lord, I spent more hours to make you a good
Subject, than upon any Man in the World besides, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.218

but since you have stirred up this Point, my Lord, I dare Warrant you
this Letter will not blush: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.219

for I did but perform the Part of an honest Man, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.220

and ever laboured to have done you good, if it might have been, and to
no other end; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.221

for what I intended for your Good, was wished from the Heart, without
Touch of any Man's Honour.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.222

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Well, my Lord, I do here protest before the
living God, that an honourable, grave, and wise Counsellor hath lamented
and grieved at the Courses he hath seen taken, and therewith hath wished
himself often dead; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.223

and this I speak upon credible and honourable Information:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.224

But I can prove thus much from Sir <font> Robert Cecil <$$font>'s own
Mouth; that he, speaking to one of his Fellow-Counsellors, should say
, that none in the World but the Infanta of <font> Spain <$$font> had
Right to the Crown of <font> England.  <$$font> ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.225

Here Sir <font> Robert Cecil <$$font> stepped forth into the Court <paren>
having kept himself private till then <$$paren> ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.226

and humbly desired leave to speak to <font> Essex.  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.227

Sir <font> R. Cecil.  <$$font> The Difference between you and me
is great; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.228

for I speak in the Person of an honest Man, and you, my Lord, in the
Person of a Traitor: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.229

so well I know, you have Wit at will.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.230

The Preheminence hath been yours, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.231

but I have Innocence, Truth of Conscience, and Honesty, to defend
me against the Scandal of slanderous Tongues, and aspiring Hearts;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.232

and I protest before God, I have loved your Person, and justified your
Virtues: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.233

and I appeal to God and the Queen, that I told her Majesty
, your Afflictions would make you a fit Servant for her.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.234

And had I not seen your ambitious Affections inclined to Usurpation,
I could have gone on my Knees to her Majesty to have done you good;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.235

but you have a Sheep's Garment in show, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.236

and in appearance are humble and religious; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.237

but God be thanked, we know you: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.238

for indeed your Religion appears by <font> Blunt, Davis <$$font> and
<font> Tresham <$$font>, your chiefest Counsellors for the present: and
by promising Liberty of Conscience hereafter.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.239

I stand for Loyalty, which I never lost; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.240

you stand for Treachery, wherewith your Heart is possess'd:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.241

and you charge me with high things, wherein I defy you to the vttermost.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.242

You, my good Lords, Counsellors of State, have had many Conferences,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.243

and I do confess I have said the King of <font> Scots <$$font> is a
Competitor, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.244

and you I have said are a Competitor: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.245

you would depose the Queen, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.246

you would be King of <font> England <$$font>, and call a Parliament.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.247

Ah, my Lord, were it but your own Case, the Loss had been the less;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.248

but you have drawn a number of noble Persons and Gentlemen of Birth and
Quality into your Net of Rebellion, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.249

and their Bloods will cry vengeance against you.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.250

For my part, I vow to God, I wish my Soul was in Heaven, and my Body at
rest, so this had never been.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.251

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Ah, Mr. Secretary, I thank God for my
Humbling; that you, in the Ruff of your Bravery, came to make your
Oration against me here this day.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.252

<font> Cecil.  <$$font> My Lord, I humbly thank God that you did not take
me for a fit Companion for you and your Humours; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.253

for if you had, you would have drawn me to betray my Sovereign, as you
have done: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.254

but I would have you name the Counsellor you speak of;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.255

name him, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.256

name him, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.257

name him if you dare, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.258

if you dare, I defy you; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.259

name him if you dare.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.260

<font> Essex.  <$$font> Here stands an honourable Person <paren> meaning
the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font> <$$paren> that knows I speak no
Fables; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.261

he heard it as well as I.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.262

<font> Cecil.  <$$font> Then, my Lord of <font> Southampton <$$font> ,
I adjure you by the Duty you owe to God, Loyalty and Allegiance you owe
to your Sovereign, by all Tokens of true Christianity, and by the antient
Friendship and Acquaintance once between us, that you name the Counsellor.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.263

<font> Southampt. <$$font> Mr. Secretary, if you will
needs have me name the Counsellor, it was Mr. Comptroller.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.264

Whereupon the Secretary falling down upon his Knees, said, I thank God
for this day; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.265

and upon his knee desired the Lord High Steward, that a Gentleman of
the Privy-Chamber <paren> or one that might have access to the Queen
<$$paren> might go, and humbly intreat her Highness to command Mr.
Comptroller to come before his Grace.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.266

Hereupon the Lord High Steward calling Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font>
<paren> a Gentleman of her Majesty's Privy-Chamber <$$paren> said
unto him, Go, Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font>, unto her Majesty,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.267

and let her understand Mr. Secretary's Demand.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.268

<font> Cecil.  <$$font> Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font>, you shall
have free access unto her Majesty; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.269

tell her, that I vow before the God of Heaven, that if she refuse to
send Mr. Comptroller, whereby I may clear my self of these open
Scandals, I will rather die at her foot, <paren> as her Subject and Vassal
<$$paren> than live to do her any more Service in this honourable degree,
wherein her Highness employs me.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.270

And withal, let me adjure you, Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font>, that
you do not acquaint Mr. Comptroller with the Cause why you come
for him.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.271

Mr. <font> Knevet <$$font> went, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.272

and not long after return'd with Mr. Comptroller, to whom
the Lord High Steward repeated the Cause why he was sent for,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.273

and desir'd him to satisfy the Lords, whether Mr. Secretary
did use any such Speech in his Hearing, or to his Knowledge.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.274

<font> Mr. Comptroller.  <$$font> I remember that once in
Mr. Secretary's Company, there was a Book read, that treated of
such matters; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.275

but I never did hear Mr. Secretary use any such words, or to
that effect.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.276

Whereupon Mr. Secretary thanked God, that tho'the Earl stood there
as a Traitor, yet he was found an honest Man, and a faithful Subject:
withal saying, I beseech God to forgive you for this open wrong done unto
me, as I do openly pronounce I forgive you from the bottom of my Heart.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.277

<font> Essex.  <$$font> And I, Mr. Secretary, do clearly and
freely forgive you with all my Soul; because I mean to die in Charity.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.278

<font> Bacon.  <$$font> My Lord, you may now perceive that my Lord of
<font> Essex <$$font> went about to procure matter, and to give over on
the instant.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,205.279

<P_206>

<font> South. <$$font> Well, I beseech your Lordship, let me
satisfy your Lordship and the rest thus much, that for my own part,
I did never know the Laws.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.281

Now, to shew the Causes that made me adventure so far as I did:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.282

The first occasion that made me adventure into these Courses, was the
Affinity betwixt my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font> and me, I being of
his Blood, and marrying his Kinswoman; so that for his sake I should
have hazarded my Life: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.283

But what I have by my forwardness offended in Act, I am altogether
ignorant, but in Thought I am assured never.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.284

And if thro'my ignorance in the Law I have offended, yet I humbly submit
my self to her Majesty, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.285

and from the bottom of my Heart do beg her gracious Pardon, if it please
her: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.286

and I hope that neither your Lordship nor any of the Peers will
hold any of the former Resolutions spoken of by these Orators for
any certainty, which depends no otherwise than one upon another.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.287

For if any foolish Speeches have passed, I protest, as I shall be saved
, that they were never purposed by me, nor understood to be so purposed
by me, to the hurt of her Majesty's Person.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.288

<font> Essex.  <$$font> I beseech your Lordship to understand me , and
assure your self, that what I now speak, is not with any desire <paren> I
protest <$$paren> to spare one drop of my Blood; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.289

and because some Honourable Persons are interested in the Cause, I would
<paren> under favour <$$paren> signify, because the Point hath been so
much urged by Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>, that at our being in
<font> London <$$font> when we were past <font> Pauls <$$font>, word
was brought me, that the Chain was drawn at <font> Ludgate <$$font> ,
and that my Lord of <font> Cumberland <$$font> was there: which when I
heard, I was right glad; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.290

for if there had been cause, I would have been glad to put my self into
so honourable a Person's hands as his: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.291

but it was a false Report, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.292

for my Lord was not then come thither.  After which I sent to Sheriff
<font> Smith <$$font>'s House, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.293

and after my coming thither, I sent the Sheriff and Mr. Alderman
<font> Watts <$$font> to my Lord Mayor, desiring him to come to us;
if he would not, to send four of his Aldermen to see if we demeaned our
selves loyally, with intent to put our selves into their Hands to use
us as they would, or to put us into any Prison; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.294

yet in regard of our private Enemies, and the fear of their Treachery,
we desired them to shut their Gates: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.295

and this was the end for which we went into the City.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.296

<font> Attor. <$$font> My Lord, if you had no other Purpose,
why did you go into <font> Grace-Church-Street <$$font> and <font>
Fen-Church-Street <$$font>, crying out all the way you went, <font>
England <$$font> is bought and sold to the <font> Spaniard!  <$$font>
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.297

<font> Southamp. <$$font> Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>,
I protest <paren> as I hope to have Mercy in Heaven <$$paren> I never
heard my Lord speak any such Word, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.298

neither did I hear of the Proclamation you speak of, made by my Lord
<font> Burleigh <$$font> and the Herald at Arms; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.299

neither did I see them: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.300

and I deny <paren> my Soul and Conscience bearing me Witness <$$paren>
that I ever knew of any Intent and Meaning, or did ever mean or intend
any Treason, Rebellion, or other Action against my Sovereign or the State;
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.301

but only what I did, was to assist my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font>
in his private Quarrel; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.302

and therefore, Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>, you have urged the
matter very far, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.303

and you wrong me therein, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.304

my Blood be upon your Head.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.305

As for my Lord of <font> Rutland <$$font>, whereas he inferreth against
me to be a persuader and inviter of my Lord of <font> Essex <$$font>
to these Actions, he wrongeth me exceedingly; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.306

for he was never the Man that saw me once discontented,
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.307

and therefore had small ground or reason so to say.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.308

And you, Mr. <font> Attorney <$$font>, whereas you charge me for
a Papist, I protest most unfeignedly, I was never conversant with any
of that sort; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.309

I only knew one <font> White <$$font>, a Priest, that went up and down
the Town, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.310

yet did I never converse with him in all my Life.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.311

<font> Essex.  <$$font> My Lord, and you that be our Peers, I beseech
you give me hearing thus far; not that I will speak it for the safeguard
of my Life, but with this my desire, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.312

I charge the Souls of all them that be our Censurers or Triers: because
out of a Form and Custom of speaking, these Orators would make them more
odious that come to the Bar, that I may not be thought to have done this
upon Revenge: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.313

for within these few days I purposed to have received the Communion,
to be a Testimony that I was far from bearing of Malice to any, not so
much as {I_would_bear} to my private Enemies.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.314

But the falling out between the Earl of <font> Southampton <$$font> and
the Lord <font> Grey <$$font>, happening on a <font> Sunday <$$font> ,
hindered my Intent; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.315

for so soon as I knew of it, I found my Affections to stir on it
exceedingly: ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.316

yet I have since that time laboured, and by my Prayers to God earnestly
desired, that I might be armed with Patience to endure all Afflictions.
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.317

And here I protest before the ever-living God, as he may have Mercy on
me, That my Conscience is clear from any disloyal Thought or Harm to
her Majesty; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.318

and my desire ever hath been to be free from Bloodshed, as Mr.
<font> Dove <$$font> can witness.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.319

But if in all my Thoughts and Purposes I did not ever desire the good
Estate of my Sovereign and Country, as of my own Soul; I beseech the
Lord then shew some Mark upon me and my Soul in this place, for a just
Vengeance of my Untruths to all the World.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.320

And God, which knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts, knoweth that I never
sought the Crown of <font> England <$$font>, nor ever wished to a higher
degree than a Subject.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.321

I greatly endeavoured to have brought my Conscience to peace, only
by seeking to secure my Access to the Presence of the Queen, that
I might speedily have unfolded my Griefs unto her Majesty against
my private Enemies; but not to have shed one drop of their Blood:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.322

And this, my Lord, I speak, to the end I might put off all imputation
of being an Hypocrite, or an Atheist; ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.323

for I was never Papist, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.324

neither did I ever favour any Sectary <paren> as my Lord of
<font> Canterbury <$$font> knoweth, and can testify <$$paren>:
ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.325

for my Religion, it is sound, ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.326

and as I live, I mean to die in it.  ESSEXSTATE-E2-P2,206.327
