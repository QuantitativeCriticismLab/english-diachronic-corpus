After the feast of <font> All Saintes <$$font> a Parliamente was begun
at <font> London <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,574.10

The king caused a newe kinde of Nobles to be made which were of lesse
value than the olde by foure pence in the noble.  STOW-E2-P2,574.11

King <font> Henrie <$$font> fou~ded the Colledge of <font> Fodringhey

<$$font> place without Temple barre, STOW-E2-P2,575.15

and were cast into the riuer of <font> Thamis <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,575.16

About the fifteenth of August the king by determination of the Counsel
appoynting to send help to the Duke of <font> Orleaunce <$$font>, sent
his second son <font> Thomas <$$font> Duke of <font> Clarence, Edwarde
<$$font> Duke of <font> Yorke <$$font>, and <font> Thomas <$$font>
Earle of <font> Dorset <$$font>, and many valiant men, with a strong
power to helpe to the Duke of <font> Orleaunce <$$font>, against the
Duke of <font> Burgonie <$$font>, or euer al y=e= other were returned,
whiche a while agoe went ouer with y=e= erle of <font> Arundale <$$font>
to ayde the Duke of <font> Burgonie <$$font>, so that many men maruelled
of the sodaine chaunge, that in so small a tyme the <font> Englishmen
<$$font> dyd ayde and assiste the two contrarie parts: STOW-E2-P2,575.17

notwythstandyng the foresayde Nobles went forewardes STOW-E2-P2,575.18

and arriued in <font> Normandie <$$font>, where when the Duke of <font>
Orleaunce <$$font> did not meete them at the tyme appointed, they
brent hys townes, and spoyled his Countrey, and tooke manye holdes.

At length, thoughe late, the Dukes of <font> Clarence <$$font> and of

And the matter was so entreated of betweene them, that our menne shoulde

About this tyme the Lorde <font> Herle <$$font> Marshall of <font> Fraunce
<$$font>, with manye other noble men and men of armes, to the number of
foure thousande, besieged a certayne holde in <font> Aquitaine <$$font>,
whyche was in the keepyng of <font> Iohn Blunte <$$font> <P_576> Knight,
who with three hundered that ayded hym, putte to flight the whole army of
the <font> Frenchmen <$$font>, and toke twelue of their men of name, and
other gentlemen to the number of <font> 120 <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,576.31

Kyng <font> Henrie <$$font> kept his Christmasse at his <font> manour
<$$font> of <font> Eltham <$$font>, being so sore sick, that sometime
men thought that he had bin dead: STOW-E2-P2,576.32

notwithstanding it pleased God that he recouered his strength againe
a little.  STOW-E2-P2,576.33

After Christmasse he called the Nobles of y=e= realm togither to a
Parliament at <font> London <$$font>; STOW-E2-P2,576.34

but he liued not to the end thereof, STOW-E2-P2,576.35

for now after the great and fortunate chaunces hapned to him, and being
deliuered of all Ciuill diuision, hee was taken with sicknesse, of the
which he languished til his appointed houre, during which sickenesse,
some euil disposed people laboured to make dissention betweene the King
and the Prince his sonne, by reason wherof, and by the acte of youth ,
which he exercised more than meanely, and for the great recourse of
people vnto him, of whom his Court was at all times more aboundant than
the King his father, the King suspected that he would presume to vsurpe
the crown, he being aliue: which suspitious iealousie was occasion that
he in part withdrewe his affection and singular loue from the Prince.
STOW-E2-P2,576.36

But when this noble Prince was aduertised of his fathers iealousie,
he disguised himself in a gown of blew satten, made full of small Oylet
holes, STOW-E2-P2,576.37

and at euery Oylet the needle wherwith it was made hanging stil by a
threede of silke.  STOW-E2-P2,576.38

And about his arme he ware a dogges coller set ful of <font> SS <$$font>
of golde, STOW-E2-P2,576.39

and the Tirets of the same also of fine gold.  STOW-E2-P2,576.40

Thus apparelled, with a great companye of Lords and other noblemen of
his Court, he came to the king his father, who at that time laye at
<font> Westminster <$$font>, where at his co~ming <paren> by his owne
commaundement <$$paren> not one of his companye auaunced himselfe further
tha~ the fire in the Hall, notwithstanding that they were greatly and
ofte desired to the contrarie by the Lordes and great estates of the
Kings Court: STOW-E2-P2,576.41

and that the Prince had commanded, to giue the lesse occasion <P_577>
of mistrust to the King his father, STOW-E2-P2,577.42

but he himselfe only accompanyed of the kings house, passed forth to
the king his father, to whom after due salutation <$$paren> {COM:sic}
he desired to shewe the intent of his minde in secrete manner.
STOW-E2-P2,577.43

Then the Kyng caused himselfe to be borne in his chayre into his secrete
chamber <paren> bycause he was deseased and might not goe <$$paren>
wher in the presence of three or foure persons, in whom the King had
most confidence, he commaunded the Prince to shewe the effect of his
minde: STOW-E2-P2,577.44

Then the Prince kneeling down before his Father, saide to him these
wordes, STOW-E2-P2,577.45

most redoubted Lord and Father, I am this time come to your presence,
as your liegman, and as your sonne naturall, in all thyngs to obay your
grace as my soueraigne Lord and father.  STOW-E2-P2,577.46

And whereas I vnderstand yee haue me suspect of my behauiour against
your grace, and that yee feare I would vsurpe your Crowne againste
the pleasure of your highnesse, of my co~uersation youre grace knoweth
that if yee were in feare of any man, of what estate soeuer he were,
my duetie were to the endaungering of my life to punishe that person,
therby to race that sore from your hearte.  STOW-E2-P2,577.47

And then howe muche rather oughte I to suffer death to bring your
grace from the feare that yee haue of me that am your naturall sonne,
and your liegeman.  STOW-E2-P2,577.48

And to that intente I haue thys daye by confession and receyuing the
Sacramente, prepared my selfe, STOW-E2-P2,577.49

and therefore moste redoubted Lorde and Father, I beseeche you in the
honour of God, for the easing of youre harte, heretofore your knees to
slea me with this dagger, STOW-E2-P2,577.50

and at that worde with all reuerence he deliuered to the king hys dagger
, saying my Lorde and Father my lyfe is not so desirous to mee, that
I woulde liue one daye that shoulde be to you {COM:sic} displeasure,
STOW-E2-P2,577.51

nor I couet not so much my life as I doe your pleasure and welfare,
STOW-E2-P2,577.52

and in your thus doing, here in the presence of these Lordes, and
tofore God at the daye of iudgemente I clearelye forgiue you my deathe.
STOW-E2-P2,577.53

At these wordes of the Prince, the King taken with compassion of hearte,
cast from him the dagger, STOW-E2-P2,577.54

and imbracing <P_578> the Prince kissed him, STOW-E2-P2,578.55

and with effusion of teares saide vnto him, my right deare and
hartily beloued sonne, it is {COM:illegible} trueth that I had you
partly suspecte, and as I now perceyue, vndeserued on your partie:
STOW-E2-P2,578.56

but seeing this your humilitie and faithfulnesse, I shall neyther slay
you, nor from henceforth haue you any more in mistrust, for no report
that shall be made vnto me, STOW-E2-P2,578.57

and therof I assure you vpon mine honor.  STOW-E2-P2,578.58

Thus by his great wisedome was the wrongfull imagination of his Fathers
hate vtterly auoyded, and hymselfe restored to the Kings former grace
and fauour.  STOW-E2-P2,578.59

After thys, as was reported by the Earle of <font> Ormonde <$$font>
<paren> to the translatour of myne author <font> Titus Liuius <$$font>
<$$paren> the king gaue to his sonne the Prince, diuerse notable
doctrines, & insignments, among which eruditio~s, one is this:
STOW-E2-P2,578.60

the King lying grieuously diseased, called before him the Prince his
sonne; STOW-E2-P2,578.61

& sayd vnto him: My sonne, I feare me soone after my departure from this
life, some discord shal grow & arise betwene thee and thy brother <font>
Thomas <$$font> Duke of <font> Clarence <$$font>, where by the realme
may be brought to destruction and miserie, STOW-E2-P2,578.62

for I knowe you both to be of greate stomacke and courage.  Wherefore I
feare that he throughe his high mynde wyll make some enterprise against
thee, intending to vsurpe vpon thee, whiche I know thy stomacke maye
not abyde easily.  STOW-E2-P2,578.63

And for dreade hereof, as ofte as it is in my remembraunce, I soare
repente me, that euer I charged my selfe with the Crowne of this Realme.
STOW-E2-P2,578.64

To these wordes of the King the Prince aunsweared thus: STOW-E2-P2,578.65

Righte redoubted Lorde and Father to the pleasure of God your grace
shall long continue with vs, and rule vs both: STOW-E2-P2,578.66

but if God haue so prouided that euer I shall succeede you in thys Realme
, I shall honour and loue my brethren aboue all menne, as long as they
be to me true, faythfull and obediente, as to theyr soueraigne Lord,
STOW-E2-P2,578.67

but if anye of them fortune to conspyre or rebell againste mee,
I assure you I shall as soone execute iustice vppon one of them, as I
shall <P_579_misnumbered_as_589> vpon the worst and most simplest person
within this your Realme.  STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.68

The Kyng hearing thys aunsweare, was therewith maruellouslye reioyced
in hys mynde, STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.69

and sayde: My deare and wel beloued Sonne, wyth thys aunswere
thou haste deliuered me of a greate and ponderous agonye:
STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.70

and I beseeche thee, and vppon my blessing charge thee, that like as
thou haste sayde, so thou minister iustice equally, and in no wise
suffer, not them that be oppressed long to call vpon thee for Iustice
, but redresse oppressions, and indifferently, and wythout delay,
STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.71

for no perswasion of flatterers, or of them that bee partiall, or suche
as vse to haue their handes replenished wyth gyftes, deferre not Iustice
vntill to morrowe, if that thou mayste doe iustice thys daye, leaste
<paren> peraduenture <$$paren> God doe Iustice on thee in the meane tyme,
and take from thee thyne authoritye: STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.72

remember, that the wealth of thy body and thy soule, and of thy Realme,
resteth in the execution of Iustice, STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.73

and doe not thy Iustice, so that thou be called a Tyraunte,
STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.74

but vse thy selfe meanely betwixte Iustice and mercie in those things
that belong to thee.  STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.75

And between parties do iustice truely and extreamely to the co~solation
of thy poore subiects that suffer iniuries, and to the punition of them
that be extortioners and doers of oppresio~s, that other therby may take
example: & in thus doing, thou shalt obtayne the fauour of God, and the
loue and fear of thy subiectes, STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.76

and therefore also thou shalte haue thy Realme more in tranquilitye
and reste, whiche shal bee occasion of greate prosperitie wythin
thy Realme, whyche <font> Englishmen <$$font> naturally do desyre:
STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.77

for so long as they haue wealthe and Ryches, so long shalte thou haue
obeysaunce: STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.78

and when they bee poore, then they bee alwayes readye at euerye motion
to make insurrections, STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.79

and it causeth them to rebel agaynst theyr soueraygne Lorde:
STOW-E2-P2,579_misnumbered_as_589.80

for the nature of them is suche, <P_580> rather to feare losing of
theyr goods and worldly substaunce, than the ieoparding of theyr liues.
STOW-E2-P2,580.81

And if thou thus keepe them in subiection mixed with loue and feare,
thou shalte haue the moste peaceable and fertyle Countrey, and the
moste louyng, faythfull, and manlye people of the Worlde: whyche shall
be cause of no small feare to thyne aduersaries.  STOW-E2-P2,580.82

My sonne when it shall please God to call me to the waye decrede for
euerye Worldely creature, to thee <paren> as my sonne and heyre <$$paren>
I muste leaue my Crowne and my Realme, whyche I aduise thee not to
take vaynelye, and {COM:next_word_illegible} a maxine elate in pryde,
and reioyced in Worldlye honour, STOW-E2-P2,580.83

but thinke that thou arte more oppressed wyth charge, to puruie for euerie
Person wythin the Realme, than exalted in vaine honoure of the Worlde.
STOW-E2-P2,580.84

Thou shalt be exalted to the Crowne, for the wealthe and conseruation
of the Realme, and not for thy singular commoditie and auaile:
STOW-E2-P2,580.85

my Sonne thou shalte be a minister to thy Realme to keepe it in
tranquilitie and defende it.  STOW-E2-P2,580.86

Like as the harte in the myddest of the bodye is principall and chiefe
thyng in the bodye, and serueth to couet and desire that thyng that is
moste necessarie to euerye of thy members, so <paren> my Sonne <$$paren>
thou shalte be amongst thy people as chiefe and principall of them to
minister, imagine and acquire those thyngs that maye be moste beneficiall
for them.  STOW-E2-P2,580.87

And then thy people shall be obediente to thee, to ayde and succoure
thee, and in al things to accomplishe thy commaundeme~ts, like as thy
members laboure, euerye one of them in theyr office to acquire and get
that thing that the hearte desireth, STOW-E2-P2,580.88

and as thy hearte is of no force and impotent without the ayde of thy
members so without thy people, thy raygne is nothing.  STOW-E2-P2,580.89

My sonne thou shalt feare and dread God aboue all things,
STOW-E2-P2,580.90

and thou shalt loue honour and worship him w=t= all thy hearte,
STOW-E2-P2,580.91

thou shalte attribute and ascribe to hym all things wherein thou seest
thy selfe to be well.  Fortunate, STOW-E2-P2,580.92

bee it victorye of thyne enymies, loue of thy friendes, <P_581> obedience
of thy subiectes, strength and actiuenesse of body, honor, riches, or
fruitefull generations, or any other thing whatsoeuer it be, that chanceth
to thy pleasure.  Thou shalt not imagine that any such thing shoulde
fortune to thee, by thyne acte, nor by thy desert, STOW-E2-P2,581.93

but thou shalte thinke that all co~meth only of the goodnesse of our Lord.
STOW-E2-P2,581.94

Thus y=u= shalt with all thine heart, prayse, honour, and thanke God of
all hys benefits that he giueth vnto thee.  STOW-E2-P2,581.95

And in thy selfe eschew all vaineglorie and elation of heart,
following the holesome counsell of the Psalmist, <paren> which sayeth
<$$paren> <font> Non nobis Domine non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloria~
<$$font> <paren> which is to say <$$paren> <font> Not vnto vs Lord,
not vnto vs, but to thy holy name be giuen laude and praise <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,581.96

These & many other admonishments and doctrines this victorious king gaue
vnto this noble prince his sonne: who with effect followed the same,
after the death of his father: whereby he obtained grace of our Lorde to
attaine to gret victories and many glorious and incredible conquests ,
through the helpe and succour of our Lord, whereof he was neuer destitute.
STOW-E2-P2,581.97

The king his father drawing to his end, after due thankes giuen, and
supplications made to God, gaue his benediction to the Prince his sonne
, STOW-E2-P2,581.98

and so yeelded to God his spirit, the.xx.  day of March <font> Anno
<$$font>.1412.  when he had raigned.xiij.  yeares, sixe months and
odde dayes.  STOW-E2-P2,581.99

KING HENRY OF MONMOUTH.  STOW-E2-P2,582.104

<$$font>

<$$heading>

Henrie the fifth began his raigne y=e=.xx.  day of March in y=e=
yere .1412.  STOW-E2-P2,582.107

This Prince exceeded the mean stature of men, STOW-E2-P2,582.108

he was beautiful of visage, his necke long, bodye slender and leane,
and hys bones smal: STOW-E2-P2,582.109

neuerthelesse he was of mareullous greate strength, and passing swifte
in running, in so much that he with two other of his Lords without
bow or other engine, would take a wilde Buck or Doe in a large Park:
STOW-E2-P2,582.110

he delighted in so~gs & musical instrume~ts, in so much y=t= in his
chappel amo~gst other his priuate prayers, he vsed certaine Psalmes of
<font> Dauid <$$font> translated into heroycall <font> English <$$font>
meeter, by <font> Iohn Lydgate <$$font>, Monke of <font> Bury <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,582.111

Whilst his father liued, beyng acco~panyed w=t= some of his <P_583>
yong Lords & gentilemen, he wold waite in disguised araye for his owne
receyuers, and distresse them of theyr money: STOW-E2-P2,583.112

and sometimes at suche enterprices both he and his company wer surely
beaten: STOW-E2-P2,583.113

and when his receiuers made to him their complaints, how they were robbed
in their comming vnto him, he wold giue them discharge of so much mony
as they had lost, STOW-E2-P2,583.114

and besides that, they should not depart from him without great rewards
for their trouble and vexation, STOW-E2-P2,583.115

especially they should be rewarded that best hadde resisted hym and
his company, and of whom he hadde receyued the greatest & most strokes.
STOW-E2-P2,583.116

But after the decease of his father, was neuer any youth, or wildnes,
that might haue place in him, STOW-E2-P2,583.117

but all his actes were sodainely chaunged into grauitie and discreation.
STOW-E2-P2,583.118

To this noble Prince <paren> by assent of the Parliament <$$paren>
all the estates of the realme, after three dayes offered to do fealtie
before he was crowned, or had solemnized his othe, wel and iustly to
gouerne the common weale, which offer, beefore was neuer found to be
made to any Prince of <font> England <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,583.119

The king gaue them all generallye thankes, for theyr good mindes towardes
hym, STOW-E2-P2,583.120

and therewyth exhorted them to the zeale of the publicke prosperitie
and honoure of the Realme.  STOW-E2-P2,583.121

If anye man hadde offended hym, he pardoned theyr trespasse,
STOW-E2-P2,583.122

and desyred heartily of God, that if he shoulde rule and doe all things
well to the honoure of God and the prosperous commoditie of the Realme
, that then God woulde suffer him to be Crowned.  But if hys fortune
shoulde bee to doe otherwise, that then God shoulde take hym to hys
mercye, and suffer hym rather to be buried than to enterprize the charge
of the Realme.  STOW-E2-P2,583.123

The ninth day of April he was crowned at <font> Westminster <$$font>,
by <font> Thomas Arundell <$$font> Archebyshoppe of <font> Canterburie
<$$font>, after whyche Coronation, he called vnto hym all those young
Lords and Gentlemen that were the folowers of his yong <P_584> actes, to
euerye one of whome he gaue rich and bounteous giftes, STOW-E2-P2,584.124

and then commanded that as many as would cha~ge their maners as he
intended to doe, should abide with him in his Courte, STOW-E2-P2,584.125

and to all that woulde perseuer in theyr former light conuersation,
he gaue expresse commaundemente vpon paine of their heades, neuer after
that day to come in his presence.  STOW-E2-P2,584.126

About this time <font> Thomas <$$font> Duke of <font> Clarence <$$font>

<P_589>

The king gaue to diuers Gentlemen the order of knighthoode,
STOW-E2-P2,589.143

and assigned the bearing of his Standarts and Banners to such me~ as he
knew to be of great strength and prowesse.  STOW-E2-P2,589.144

All thing being set in good order and array, the King with all his host
ascended to the toppe of an high hill there nigh, STOW-E2-P2,589.145

and there he rested the next day.  STOW-E2-P2,589.146

On the fifteenth day of August, the Duke of <font> Clarence <$$font>,
leader of the foreward, in good ordinance, entred his iourney towarde a
Towne called <font> Herefleete <$$font>, distant from <font> Kedecamp
<$$font> scarcely three leagues, where he lodged his host in a field
before the towne.  STOW-E2-P2,589.147

The King at his comming, lodged himselfe nigh to the first warde, not
farre from the Towne.  STOW-E2-P2,589.148

The Earle of <font> Suffolke, Michaell at Poole <$$font>, Chiefetayne
of the rereward, lodged on the other side before the Towne.
STOW-E2-P2,589.149

Other noble men that had the conduct of the two wings, lodged them,
one on the right ha~d, the other on the left.  STOW-E2-P2,589.150

Forthwith were sent to the Towne, men of armes in great number, to see
the scituation thereof, who shortly returned with a great pray of Cattell,
and enformed the King of all his demaundes.  STOW-E2-P2,589.151

<font> Hereflete <$$font> is the key of the see of all <font> Normandy
<$$font>, STOW-E2-P2,589.152

and is scituate vpon the Sea side, by the Riuer of <font> Seene <$$font>
, betwixte two hilles, STOW-E2-P2,589.153

and through the middle thereof runneth a Riuer, whiche not farre from
the same Towne entreth into the <font> Seane <$$font>, STOW-E2-P2,589.154

and from thence, both those Riuers in one descende into the Sea, where
as a great and goodly Hauen is, belonging to the same Towne, which
Hauen, is garnished with the defence of two faire and strong Towers:
STOW-E2-P2,589.155

and in the same Hauen a right great Nauie of Shippes may ride in <P_590>
safetie: STOW-E2-P2,590.156

and if the inhabitants of this Towne enclose and keepe within the Towne
the course of the foresayd Riuer by their sluces, as they may right well
do, then the Riuer riseth without the Towne so high, that it forecloseth
all entries to the walles, so that no man may approch the towne on
that part.  STOW-E2-P2,590.157

This Towne is also defended with high and thicke walles and towers,
STOW-E2-P2,590.158

and is also enuironed with broade and deepe ditches.  STOW-E2-P2,590.159

To this Towne also belongeth only two Gates for entries, the one called
<font> Calturances <$$font>, the other <font> Mostrouillier <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,590.160

In this Towne, besides the inhabitants thereof, for the defence of
the same, were foure hundred men of armes deputed in <font> Garrison
<$$font>, amongst whome, were these Lords, Lord <font> Discouteuile
<$$font>, chiefe Captayne of the Towne, Lord <font> Blanuile <$$font>
, Lord <font> Haqueuile <$$font>, Lord <font> Harmanuile <$$font>, Lord
<font> Eancourt <$$font>, Lord <font> Gaillard Ros <$$font>, and diuers
other Lords and men expert in warre.  STOW-E2-P2,590.161

The King commanding the Duke of <font> Clarence <$$font> to asseege
the Towne, he endeuoured to conuey his people ouer the Riuer, in the
passage whereof, he had a great skirmish with the inhabitants of the
Towne, STOW-E2-P2,590.162

but at the last his aduersaries being put to flight, recoyled within
the walles.  STOW-E2-P2,590.163

The Duke conuayde ouer the Riuer all his ward and company,
STOW-E2-P2,590.164

and bycause the Riuer deuided the Kings Camp from the Dukes, they
ordeyned a ready and sure passage ouer the same Riuer betwixt both the
Campes, to the keeping whereof, certayne Gentlemen were appoynted, so
that theyr enimies myghte not endomage them neyther by Water nor Lande.
STOW-E2-P2,590.165

In this meane time befell a great misaduenture to the <font> Frenchmen
<$$font> that were beseeged, STOW-E2-P2,590.166

for the Gonnepouder and shotte that was sent vnto them by the <font>
French <$$font> King, was encountred vpon the Sea by the <font>
Englishmen <$$font>, and taken, to their great displeasure and domage.
STOW-E2-P2,590.167

The King gaue the charge of the fielde to his brother <font> Humfrey
<$$font> Duke of <font> Glocester <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,590.168

On the same side the Riuer that the King lay, was y=e= Duke of <font>
York <$$font>, high Connstable <P_591> of <font> England <$$font> lodged
with his band.  STOW-E2-P2,591.169

When euery man was placed, y=e= Towne was so streightly asseeged, that
all entries and issues of the Towne were stopped, so y=t= they of y=e=
towne were in dispaire to haue any succour from the Realme of <font>
France <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,591.170

Many engins were reysed by the English, which in short time should haue
bin the destruction of the walles, if they of the Towne had not the sooner
stopped the Riuer of the same towne within, wherby the water gathered &
reised without the towne betwixt the King and the D. of <font>
Clarence <$$font>, to the semblance of a little Sea, which caused the
<font> Englishmen <$$font> to withdraw their Gonnes, and other engins,
whereby at that time the walles were saued.  STOW-E2-P2,591.171

Then the King caused to be made vnder the water three great Mines vnto the
walles of the towne, which in like maner had bin the cause of their ruine,
if the inhabitants had not countermined them, and lessed their purpose.
STOW-E2-P2,591.172

The inhabitants of the Town perceyuing themselues thus streightly asseeged
, as well by Land as by Sea, conuayde all their Shippes within their
Haue~, STOW-E2-P2,591.173

and bound them togither with cheynes, STOW-E2-P2,591.174

and in the two towers that were made for the defence of the Hauen, they
put certaine Garrisons, and armed men, who oftentimes attempted to inuade
the Kings Nauie, STOW-E2-P2,591.175

but at all times they were by his Shippes beaten, and constreyned to
recule still within their Hauen: STOW-E2-P2,591.176

at the last, the Captaynes and inhabitants considering that by such
skirmishes <paren> as well vpon the Land as vpon the Sea <$$paren>
they gained nothing, tooke this appointment with the King, that if they
were not rescued by the <font> Frenchmen <$$font> within certayne dayes
limited, they shoulde then delyuer into hys handes the Towne, with thirtie
persons of the greatest and most noble within the Towne, suche as the
King woulde desire, to bee ordered at the Kings pleasure , and all the
residue, as well menne of Warre, as the inhabitantes of the same Towne,
without armoure, and leauing behynde them theyr goodes, shoulde freely
goe where they woulde, for the suretie of whyche appoyntemente to bee
kepte, they deliuered <P_592> vnto the king twelue of their greatest
personages for pleages.  STOW-E2-P2,592.177

The Captaynes and inhabitants of the Towne seeing their day of appoyntment
to approch, and themselues vtterly desperate of any succours of their
people, ordeyned to perfourme their couenant at their day prefixed,
whiche was the xxij. of September, on which day came Sir <font>
Lionell Braquemont <$$font> gouernour of the Towne, vnto the King,
STOW-E2-P2,592.178

and kneeling before him, sayd: Most victorious Prince, beholde heere
the keyes of this Towne, which after our promis I yeeld vnto you, with
the Towne, my selfe, and my companie.  STOW-E2-P2,592.179

Then were brought to the King the Lord <font> Coteuile <$$font>, the
Lord <font> Gangepurt <$$font>, and other, to the number of thirtie,
STOW-E2-P2,592.180

and all the residue, as well souldioures, as inhabitants, were suffered
vnarmed to depart.  STOW-E2-P2,592.181

The king constitute Captayne of the Towne, Sir <font> Thomas Brawford
<$$font> Earle of <font> Dorset <$$font> hys Vnkle, to whome he
also committed two thousand souldiers, chosen men of his host.
STOW-E2-P2,592.182

Then considering that winter drew on, as also the losse of their men,
by reason of the Flu then reigning amongst them, by which infirmitie ,
died <font> Michaell at Poole <$$font>, Earle of <font> Suffolke <$$font>,
the Bishop of <font> Norwich <$$font>, the Lord <font> Beawmont <$$font>,
and others, and of the commons, to the number of two thousand and aboue.
King <font> Henry <$$font> created the sonne of <font> Michaell at Poole
<$$font>, Earle of <font> Suffolk <$$font> , who liued not long after.
STOW-E2-P2,592.183

After King <font> Henry <$$font> had remayned at <font> Harefleete
<$$font> fifteene dayes, after y=e= deliuerie of the Towne, and of
the Towers, he departed from thence towards <font> Caleis <$$font>,
whereof, when his enimies were aduertised, and also by what way he
intended to passe; all the people of the Countrey, Cities, and Townes
, were maruellousile oppressed with feare, wherefore they hasted them
to defensible places, and other that were apt to warre, tooke them to
their horsses, and assembled them togither in great number, with no
small companie of footemen, STOW-E2-P2,592.184

and in all that they might they oppressed the <font> Englishmen <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,592.185

The Kings host kept an easie pace, without making any <P_593> hast,
STOW-E2-P2,593.186

and when they approched the Towne of <font> Ewe <$$font>, their enimies
assayled them in the fieldes with great force and noyse, where on both
parties it was foughten sore and vigorously: STOW-E2-P2,593.187

but the <font> Frenchmen <$$font> reculed to the Towne, where they were
in good suretie.  STOW-E2-P2,593.188

From thence the King departed, STOW-E2-P2,593.189

and came to a passage of the Riuer of <font> Some <$$font>, which the
<font> Frenchmen <$$font> call <font> Blankhestoke <$$font>, or <font>
Blanchtache <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,593.190

This passage, at the comming vnto it, was fixed with sharp stakes by
their enimies, so that they could not passe there, but were constreyned
to go farther seeking their passage, vntill they came directly to haue
the Citie of <font> Amiens <$$font>, and the Castell of <font> Gorby
<$$font> on their left side, where they of the sayde Citie began with
them a new fight: STOW-E2-P2,593.191

but they were soone forced by the English to returne to their Citie
agayne.  STOW-E2-P2,593.192

The xix. of October the King passed the Riuer of <font>
Some <$$font>, at the passage of <font> Vienna <$$font>, and <font>
Bethew-court <$$font>, STOW-E2-P2,593.193

and wente then to lodge him at <font> Mouche-legach <$$font>, fro~
whence, he aduanced him towardes the Riuer of <font> Miramont <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,593.194

In the meane time, the <font> French <$$font> King, and the Duke of <font>
Guyen <$$font> his sonne, then Dolphin, purposing to resist the <font>
Englishmen <$$font>, came to <font> Roane <$$font>, from whence, they
sent three Heraults to the King of <font> England <$$font> , to giue
vnderstanding that he should not escape without battayle: vnto whome
the sayde King answered, All things be done at the pleasure of God,
STOW-E2-P2,593.195

I will keepe the right way towardes <font> Calais: <$$font>
STOW-E2-P2,593.196

if our aduersaries do attempt to disturbe vs in oure iourney, we
thinke they shall not do it without their owne great danger and perill.
STOW-E2-P2,593.197

From thence, King <font> Henry <$$font> remoued to a Village called <font>
Forceuile <$$font>, aduancing his host towardes the Riuer of <font>
Miramont <$$font>, STOW-E2-P2,593.198

and the next day they passed by the <font> Cheue <$$font>,
STOW-E2-P2,593.199

and the King lodged that night at <font> Bonyers lestaillon <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,593.200

The next day the King remoued vnto <font> Bangy <$$font>.
STOW-E2-P2,593.201

The next day late in the night the King came to a Village named <font>
Agencourt, Euguerant <$$font> sayeth <font> Masencelles <$$font>, where
they lodged not distant from the <font> French <$$font> host the space
of two hundred and fiftie spaces.  STOW-E2-P2,593.202

The <font> Frenchmen <$$font> fixed their Banners and Standarts with the
Banner Royall, whereof the <P_594> Connestable had the conduct, in the
field by them deuised and chosen, which was in the Countie of <font>
S. Paule <$$font>, in y=e= grou~d of <font> Agencourt <$$font>
, by whiche the day following, the <font> Englishmen <$$font> should
passe to go to <font> Caleis <$$font>.  STOW-E2-P2,594.203
