<P_23L>

Micheas the prophet also dyd not spare to blame King Achab for hys
wyckednes, accordinge <P_24L> to goddes wil and to prophesye of his
destruction contrary vnto manye false prophetes.  LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.2

These forsayde kynges beinge admonished by the ministers of gods worde,
because they woulde not folow their godly doctryne and correcte their
lyues, came vnto utter destruction.  LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.3

Pharao geuynge no credit vnto Moyses the prophet of God, but applyant
vnto the lustes of his owne herte, what tyme he hard of the passage of
Goddes people, hauyng no feare or remembraunce of gods worke, he did
prosecute after entendyng to destroye them LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.4

and was drowned in ye red sea.  LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.5

Kynge Acab also because he wold not herken vnto Micheas was kilde with
an arrowe.  LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.6

Likewise also the house of Iereboam with other many, came vnto
destruction, because he woulde not heare the ministers of Goddes
worde, and correcte hys lyfe accordyng vnto hys wyl, and pleasure.
LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.7

Let the preacher therefore neuer feare to declare the message of God
vnto all men.  LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.8

And if the king wyll not heare them then the preachers may admonyshe
and charge them wyth their dewties, and so leaue them vnto God and praye
for them.  LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.9

But if the preachers digresse out of Christes chaire, and shal speake
their owne phantasyes, then in stede of, <font> Quaecunque iusserint vos
facere, facite, et seruate <$$font>.  What so euer $they byd you obserue
that obserue and do.  Change it into these wordes folowynge: <font> Cauete
vero vobis a pseudo Prophetis qui veniunt ad vos etc. <$$font>
Be ware of false Prophetes which come vnto you in shepes clothing ,
but inwardly, they are rauenyng woulffes, LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.10

ye shall knowe them by their frutes: LATIMER-E1-P2,24L.11

Yea, change <font> Quaecunque iusserint, <$$font> yf their doctryne be
euel <$$paren> into <font> Cauete a sermento phariseorum, etc.
<$$font> That is: Take <P_25L> hede and beware of the, leauen of the
Phariseis, and of the Saduces.  LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.12

In teaching euel doctryne, all preachers are to be eschewed, and in no
wyse to be harkened vnto.  LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.13

In speakyng trueth: thei are to be hard.  LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.14

All thynges wrytten in goddes boke, are moost certayne true, and
profitable for all men.  LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.15

For in it, is contayned mete matter for Kynges, Prynces, Rulers, Byshops,
and for alle states.  Wherfore, it behoueth euerye preacher, sum what to
appoynt and accommodate hym selfe, and hys matter a greeable vnto the
comforte, and amendemente of the audience, vnto the which he declareth
the message of God.  LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.16

If he preache before a kyng, let hys matter be concernynge the offyce
of a kinge, LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.17

if before a byshoppe, then lette hym treate of byshoplye dutyes and
orders, LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.18

and so forthe in other matters, as time and audience shal require.
LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.19

I haue thoughte it good, to intreate vpon these wordes folowynge whyche
are wrytten in the.xvii.  Chapter of Deuteronomye.  <font> Cum ueneris in
terram quam Dominus Deus dat tibi possederisque eam.  <$$font> That is.
When thou arte come vnto the Lande whiche the Lorde thy God geueth the,
and enioyeste it, and dwelleste therin: If thou shalt say, I wil set a
kynge ouer me: lyke vnto al the nacions that are aboute me: Then thou
shalt make him kynge ouer the, whome the Lorde thy God shall chose.
LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.20

One of thy brethren muste thou make Kynge ouer the, LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.21

and mayste not set a stranger ouer the, whiche is not of thy brethren.
LATIMER-E1-P2,25L.22

But in any wyse, let him not holde to manye horsses, that he bringe not
the people <P_26L> agayne to Egypt, thorowe the multitude of horsses,
for as muche as the Lorde hath sayd vnto you: ye shall hence forth go
no more agayne that waye.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.23

Also he shal not haue to many wyues, lest hys herte turne awaye,
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.24

neyther shall he gether hym syluer and gould to much.
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.25

As in dyuerse other places of scripture is mete matter for al estates.
So in thys forsayede place is describyd cheyfly the doctryne fyt for
a kynge.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.26

But who is worthye to vtter thys doctryne before oure moste noble kynge?
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.27

Not I God knoweth, whyche am thoroughe age, boethe weake in body and
obliuious, LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.28

vnapte I am, not only because of paynful study, but also for the short
warning.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.29

Well vnto God I wyll make my mone, who neuer fayled me.
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.30

<font> Auxiliator in necessitatibus.  <$$font> LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.31

God is my helper in all my necessities.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.32

To hym alone wyl I make my peticion.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.33

To praye vnto sayntes departed I am not taught, LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.34

to desyre like grace of god as they had <paren> right godly it is
<$$paren> LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.35

or to beleue God to be no lesse mercyfull vnto vs <paren> beinge
faythful <$$paren> then he was vnto them, greately comfortable it is.
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.36

Therfore only vnto God let vs lyfte vp our hertes and say the Lordes
prayer.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.37

<font> Cum veneris, etc. <$$font> LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.38

When thou art come vnto ye land which the lord, etc. Thou shalt

One of thi brethren must thou make king ouer the, LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.40

and must not set a straunger ouer ye which is not of thy brethren.
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.41

But in any wyse let not suche one {COM:sic} prepare vnto him selfe many
horses that he bryng not.  etc. LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.42

Furthermore let hym not prepare vnto hym selfe manye wyues, least his
herte recede frome God.  LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.43

Nor he shal not multiply vnto hym selfe, to much golde, and syluer.
LATIMER-E1-P2,26L.44

As the text doeth ryse, I wyl touche and go a lyttle in euery place,
vntyl I come <P_27L> vnto to much.  LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.45

I wyl touche al the forsayd thynges, but not to muche.
LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.46

The texte is, when thou shalt come into the land, etc. To haue
a kyng LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.47

the Israelites dyd wyth much importunitye call vnto God,
LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.48

and God longe before promised theim a kynge LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.49

and were full certified thereof, that God hadde promised that thynge.
LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.50

For vnto Abraham he sayed: <font> Ego crescere te faciam vehementer
ponamque te in gentes, sed et reges ex te prodibunt.  <$$font> That is,
I wil multipli the excedingly, LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.51

and wil mak nations of the, LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.52

yea and kings shal spring out of the.  LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.53

These wordes were spoken long before the chyldren of Israel had any king.
LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.54

Notwithstandyng, yet God prescrybid vnto them an order, howe $they shulde
chose their kyng, and what manner a man he shoulde be, where he saith:
when thou shalt come in to the lande, etc. As who should say.
O ye children of Israel I knowe your nature ryght well, whiche is euyl,
and inclined vnto al euyls.  LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.55

I know that thou wilt chose a kyng to raygne over the and to apere
glorious in the face of the world, after the manner of gentyles,
LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.56

But because thou art stiffe necked, wilde, and art geuen to walke without
a brydell, and lyne.  Therfore now I wyll preuente thy euyl and bestly
manners LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.57

I will hedge strongly thy waye, LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.58

I wyll make a durable lawe, whyche shal compell the to walke ordinatlye,
and in a plain way, that is thou shalt not chose the a kynge after thy
wyll and fantasye but after me thy Lord and God.  LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.59

Thus, god condycioned wyth the Iewes, that theyr king should be suche
a one as he hym self wold chose them.  LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.60

And was not much vnlyke $the bargayne that I herd of late shulde be
betwixte two fryndes for a horsse, LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.61

the owner promysed the other shuld haue the horsse yf he wold,
LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.62

the other axed ye price, LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.63

he sayed: xx. nobles LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.64

The other wold geue hym but iiii. pound: LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.65

ye owner said he shuld not haue hym then, LATIMER-E1-P2,27L.66

The other claymed the horsse bycause he sayd, he <P_28L> shoulde haue
hym if he wold, LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.67

Thus thys bargayne became a westminster matter, LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.68

the lawyers gote twyse the valure {COM:sic} of the horse,
LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.69

and when all came to all, two fooles made an ende of the matter.
LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.70

Howbeit, the Israelites coulde not go to lawe wyth God, for chosynge
theyr kynge, LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.71

for would they, $n $yl {TEXT:nyl} they, theyr kinge shold be of his
chosynge, lest they should walke inordinatly, in a deceyuable way,
vnto theyr vtter losse and destruction.  LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.72

For as they say commonely <font> Qui vadit plane, vadit sane.  <$$font>
that is.  He that walketh playnly, walketh safely.  LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.73

As the Iewes were styfnecked, and were euer ready to walke inordinatelye ,
no lesse are we Englyshe men geuen to vntowardnes, and inordinate walkynge
after oure owne fantasies and braynes.  LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.74

We wyll walke wythoute the limites of Goddes worde, LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.75

we wyll chose a kynge at our owne pleasure.  LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.76

But let vs learne to frame our lyues after the noble king Dauid whych
when he had manye occasions, geuen of kyng Saul to worke euyl, for euyl,
yea, and hauynge manye tymes oportunity to perfourme mischief and to
slay king Saule.  Neuerthelesse yet fearyng, would not folowe hys fleshly
affections and walke inordinatelye, wythoute the wyll of Gods worde, whych
he confessed alwayes to be hys direction, sayinge.  <font> Lucerna pedibus
meis verbum tuum et lumen femitis meis.  <$$font> Thy worde, O Lorde is a
Lanterne vnto my feete, and a lyght vnto my steppes.  LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.77

Thus hauynge in mynde, to walke ordinatly he did alwaies auoyde to
do euyll.  LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.78

For whan kyng Saul was in a caue without anye man.  Dauid and hys men
sytting by the sydes of the caue, yea and Dauids men mouyng hym to kyl
Saul, Dauid made answer LATIMER-E1-P2,28L.79

and sayd vnto them: <font> Seruet me dominus, ne rem istam.  etc.
contra dominum meum Messiam etc. <$$font> That is The Lord kepe
<P_29L> me from doyng this thing vnto my maister yat is the lordes
anointed.  LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.80

At another tyme also, moued by Abisay to kyl Saul sleping, Dauid said
: <font> Ne interficias eum, quis enim impune manum suum inferret
vncto domino etc. <$$font> That is: Destroye hym not,
LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.81

for who can laye hys handes on the Lordes anoynted and be gyltlesse.
etc. LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.82

I wold God we wolde folowe King Dauid, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.83

and then we shuld walke ordinatly, and yet do but yat we are bounde of
dutye to do, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.84

for God sayth: <font> Quod ego praecipio, hoc tantum facito.  <$$font>
That thing which I commande that only do.  LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.85

There is a greate errour risen now a daies among many of vs, which are
vayne and new fangled men clymbyng beyond the limites of our capacitye
and wytte, in wrenching thys text of scrypture, hereafter folowyng,
after their owne phantasie and brayne, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.86

their erroure is vpon this text: <font> Audi vocem populi in omnibus
quae dicunt tibi, non enim te reprobant sed me reprobarunt ne regnem
super eos.  <$$font> That is, Heare the voyce of the people in all that
they say vnto the, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.87

for they haue not caste the a way but me.  LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.88

Thei wrench these wordes a wryte after their owne fantasies,
LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.89

and make much doubte as touchynge a kynge, and hys Godlye name.
LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.90

They that so do walketh inordinatly, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.91

they walk not directely and playnly, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.92

but delite in balkes, and stubble way.  LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.93

It maketh no matter by what name the rulers be named, if so be they shall
walke ordinately with god, and derect {COM:sic} their steps with god.
LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.94

For both patriarkes Iudges, and kynges, had, and haue their authorytie
of God, LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.95

and therfore Godli {COM:sic}.  LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.96

But this ought to be considered which God saieth.  <font> Non praeficere
tibi potest hominem alienum.  <$$font> that is.  Thou must not set a
straunger over the.  LATIMER-E1-P2,29L.97

<P_30L>

It hath pleased God to graunt vs a naturall liege kynge and Lorde
, of oure owne nation an Englysh man, one of our owne religion.
LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.99

God hath geuen hym vnto vs, LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.100

and is a mooste precious treasure, LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.101

and yet mani of vs do desyre a straunger to be kynge ouer vs.
LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.102

Let vs no more desyre to be bankers, LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.103

but lett vs endeauoure to walke ordinatelye and plainely, after the word
of God.  LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.104

Let vs folow Daniel, LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.105

let vs not seke the death of oure moste noble and ryghtfull
Kynge , oure owne brother, boeth by natyuyty, and Godly relygion.
LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.106

Let vs pray for hys good state, that he may lyue long among vs.
LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.107

Oh what a plage were it, that a straunge kinge of a straunge land,
and of a straung religion should raygne ouer vs.  LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.108

Where nowe we be gouerned in the true relygion, he should extirpe and
plucke away all to gether, and then plante agayn all abomynacyon, and
popery, LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.109

God kepe suche a kynge from vs.  LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.110

Well the kynges grace hath systers, my Ladye Mary, and my Lady Elizabeth ,
whych by succession and course are inheritours to the crowne.  Who yf
they shulde mary with straungers, what should ensue God knoweth.
LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.111

But god graunt they neuer come vnto coursyng nor succedynge.
LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.112

Therfore to auoyd thys plage, let vs amende oure lyues and put awaye
all pryde, whyche doth drowne men in thys realme at these dayes, all
couetousnes where in the magistrates and ryche men of thys realme are
ouerwhelmed, all lechery and other excessyue vyces, prouokynge gods
wrath, were he not mercyful, euen to take from vs oure naturall kynge
and leyge Lorde, yea, and to plage vs wyth a straunge kynge for oure
vnrepentaunte herte.  Wherfore <paren> yf as ye saye <$$paren> ye loue
the kynge, amende your lyues, and then ye $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} a meane

for vndowtedlye synnes prouoke much goddes wrath LATIMER-E1-P2,30L.114

scripture sayth: <font> Dabo tibi regem in furore meo, <$$font> <P_31L>
That is: I wyll geue a kynge in my wrathe.  LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.115

Now we haue a lawfull kyng, a godly kynge, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.116

neuertheles yet many euyls do raygne.  LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.117

Longe tyme the mynisters appoynted, hath studied to amende, and redres
al euyles, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.118

long time before thys greate laboure hathe bene about this matter,
LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.119

great crakes hath bene made that al shoulde be well.
LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.120

But when all came to all for theyr bostes, lyttle or nothynge was done
, in whome these words of Horace mai wel be verified sayinge.  <font>
Parturiunt montes, nascitur ridiculus mus.  <$$font> The mountains
swelleth vp, the pore mouse is brought out, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.121

long before thys tyme, many hath taken in hande to brynge manye thynges
vnto paste, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.122

but finally theyr worckes came vnto small effect and profyte.
LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.123

Now I here say all thinges are ended after a Godly maner, or els shortelye

Make hast, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.125

make hast, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.126

and let vs learne to conuerte, to repente, and mende our lyues.
LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.127

If we do not, I feare, I feare, lest for our synnes and vnthankefulnes ,
an Hipocrit shal raigne ouer vs.  LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.128

Long we haue bene seruantes and in bondage, seruyng the pope in Egypte.
LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.129

God hath geuen vs a deliuerer, a natural kynge.  LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.130

Let vs seke no stranger of another nacion, no hypocrite, whiche shall
brynge in agayne al papistrie, hipocricie, and Idolatrye.  No diabolicall
minister whyche shall mayntayne all deuelishe worckes and euyll exercises.
LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.131

But let vs pray that God mayntayne and continue oure most excellente kynge
here presente, true inheritoure of thys our realme, both by natyuytye,
and also by the special gift and ordinaunce of God.  LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.132

He doth vs rectify in the libertie of the gospel, LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.133

in that therefore let vs stand.  LATIMER-E1-P2,31L.134

<font> State ergo in libertate, qua Christus nos liberauit.  <$$font>

Stande ye in the libertye, wherwyth Chryste hath made vs free.

In Chrystes lybertye, <P_32L> If we cast away all euyl, fraude
, and deceyte, with such other vices, contrary to Gods word.
LATIMER-E1-P2,32L.137

And in so doing we shal not onely prolonge and mayntayne our most noble
kynges dayes in prosperitie: LATIMER-E1-P2,32L.138

LATIMER-E1-P2,39L.164

Also it is ye Kinges honour that the commen wealth be auaunsed, that the
dearth of these forsaied thynges be prouided for, and the commodities
of thys Realme so emploied, as it may be to the setting his <P_40L>
subiectes on worke, and kepyng them from idlenes.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.165

And herin resteth the kinges honour and hys office, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.166

So doynge, his accompte before God $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} alowed,
and rewarded.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.167

Furder more, if the kinges honour <paren> as sum men say <$$paren>
standeth in the great multitude of people.  Then these grasiers,
inclosers, and rente-rearers, are hinderers of the kinges honour.
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.168

For wher as haue bene a great meany of householders and inhabitauntes,
ther is nowe but a shepherd and his dogge, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.169

so thei hynder the kinges honour most of al.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.170

My lordes and maisters, I say also, that all suche procedynges which
are agaynste the Kynges honoure <paren> as I haue a part declared before
<$$paren> and as far as I can perceiue, do intend plainly, to make the
yeomanry slauery and the Cleargye shauery.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.171

For suche worckes are al syngular, priuate welth and commoditye.
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.172

We of the cleargye had to much, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.173

but that is taken away.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.174

and nowe we haue to little.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.175

But for myne owne part, I haue no cause to complaine,
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.176

for I thanke God and the kyng.  I haue sufficient, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.177

and God is my iudge I came not to craue of anye man, any thyng,
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.178

but I knowe theim that haue to litle.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.179

There lyeth.  a greate matter by these appropriacions,
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.180

greate reformacions is to be had in them.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.181

I knowe wher is a great market Towne with diuers hamelets and
inhabitauntes, wher do rise yereli of their labours to the value of.l.
pounde, and the vicar that serueth <paren> being so great a cure
<$$paren> hath but.xii.  or.xiiii.  markes by yere, so that of thys
pension he is not able to by him bokes, nor geue hys neyghboure dryncke,
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.182

al the great gaine goeth another way.  LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.183

My father was a Yoman, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.184

and had no landes of his owne, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.185

onelye he had a farme of.iii.  or iiii. pound by yere at the
vttermost, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.186

and here vpon he tilled so much as kepte halfe a dosen men.
LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.187

He had walke for a hundred shepe, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.188

and my mother mylked.xxx.  Kyne, LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.189

He was able LATIMER-E1-P2,40L.190

and did find the king a harnesse, wyth hym selfe, and hys <P_41L> horsse,
whyle he came to ye place that he should receyue the kynges wages.
LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.191

I can remembre, yat I buckled hys harnes, when he went vnto Blacke
heeath felde.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.192

He kept me to schole, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.193

or elles I had not bene able to haue preached before the kinges maiestie
nowe.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.194

He maryed my systers with.v.  pounde or.xx.  nobles a pece, so that he
broughte them vp in godlines, and feare of God.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.195

He kept hospitalitie for his pore neighbours.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.196

And sum almess he gaue to the poore, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.197

and all thys did he of the sayd farme.  Wher he that now hath it,
paieth.xvi.  pounde by yere or more, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.198

and is not able to do any thing for his Prynce, for himselfe, nor for
his children, or geue a cup of drincke to the pore.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.199

Thus al the enhansinge and rearing goth to your priuate commoditie
and wealth.  So that where ye had a single to much, you haue that:
LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.200

and syns the same, ye haue enhanced the rente, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.201

and so haue encreased an other to much.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.202

So now ye haue doble to muche, whyche is to to much.
LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.203

But let the preacher preach til his tong be worne to the stompes,
LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.204

nothing is amended.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.205

We haue good statutes made for the commen welth as touching comeners,
enclosers, many metinges and Sessions, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.206

but in the end of the matter their commeth nothing forth.
LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.207

Wel, well, thys is one thynge I wyll saye vnto you, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.208

from whens it commeth I knowe, LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.209

euen from the deuill.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.210

I knowe his intent in it.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.211

For if ye bryng it to passe, that the yomanry be not able to put their
sonnes to schole <paren> as in dede vniuersities do wonderously decaye
al redy <$$paren> and that they be not able to mary their daughters to
the auoidyng of whoredome, I say ye plucke saluation from the people
and vtterly distroy the realme.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.212

For by yomans sonnes, the fayth of Christ is, and hath bene maintained
chefely.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.213

Is this realme taught by rich mens sonnes.  LATIMER-E1-P2,41L.214

No no, reade <P_42L> the Cronicles ye shall fynde sumtime noble
mennes sonnes, which haue bene vnpreaching byshoppes and prelates,
LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.215

but ye, shall finde none of them learned men.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.216

But verilye, they that shoulde loke to the redresse of these thinges,
be the greatest against them.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.217

In thys realme are a great meany of folkes, LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.218

and amongest many, I knowe but one of tender zeale.  at the mocion of
his poore tennauntes, hath let downe his landes to the old rentes for
their reliefe.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.219

For goddes loue, let not him {COM:sic} be a Phenix, LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.220

let him not be alone, LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.221

Let hym not be an Hermite closed in a wall, LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.222

sum good man follow him LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.223

and do as he geueth example.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.224

Surueiers {COM:sic} there be, yat gredyly gorge vp their couetouse,
guttes hande makers, I meane <paren> honest men I touch not <$$paren>
but al suche as suruei LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.225

thei make vp their mouthes LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.226

but the commens be vtterlye vndone by them.  Whose bitter cry ascendyng
vp to the eares of the god of Sabaoth, the gredy pyt of hel burning fire
<paren> without great repentaunce <$$paren> do tary and loke for them.
LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.227

A redresse God graunt.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.228

For suerly, suerly, but yat ii. thinges do comfort me I wold
despaire of the redresse in these maters.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.229

One is, that the kinges maiestie when he commeth to age: wyll se a
redresse of these thinges so out of frame.  Geuing example by letting
doune his owne landes first and then enioyne hys subiectes to folowe him.
LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.230

The second hope I haue is, I beleue that the general accomptyng daye is
at hande, LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.231

the dreadfull day of iudgement I meane, whiche shall make an end of al
these calamities and miseries.  LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.232

For as the scryptures be <font> Cum dixerint pax pax <$$font>, When they
shal say peace, peace: <font> Omnia tuta <$$font>, all thynges are sure:
LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.233

Then is the day at hand, LATIMER-E1-P2,42L.234

a mery day I saye, for al such as do in this worlde studye to serue and
please god and continue in his fayth, feare and loue: and a dreadful,
horrible day for them that decline from God walking in ther owne wayes ,
to whom as it is wrytten in the.xxv of <P_43L> Mathew is sayd: <font>
Ite maledicti in ignem eternum.  <$$font> Go ye curssed into euerlastynge
punyshment.  Wher $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} waylinge and gnashing of teeth.
LATIMER-E1-P2,43L.235

But vnto ye other he shal saye: <font> Venite benedicti.  <$$font>
come ye blessed chyldren of my father, LATIMER-E1-P2,43L.236

possesse ye the kyngdome prepared for you from the beginninge of the
worlde, of the which god make vs al partakers.  LATIMER-E1-P2,43L.237

Amen.  LATIMER-E1-P2,43L.238

<P_55L>

<heading>

<font> The seconde sermon <$$font> LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.241

<$$heading>

<font> Quaecunque scripta sunt, ad nostram doctrinam.  etce.  <$$font>
LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.243

All thinges yat are written in Gods boke, in the holye Bible, they were
wrytten before oure tyme, but yet to continue from age to age as long
as the worlde doeth stand.  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.244

In thys Boke is contayned doctrine of al estates, euen for kynges.
LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.245

A kynge herein maye learne how to gyde hymselfe, LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.246

I tolde you in my laste sermon muche of the duty of a kyng.
LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.247

And ther is one place behynd yet, LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.248

and it folowith in ye texte.  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.249

<font> Postquam autem sederit in folio regni sui, et cete.  <$$font>
LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.250

And when the kyng is sette in the seate of hys kyngdome, he shall
wryte hym out a boke and take a copy of ye priestes or Leuites.
LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.251

He shall haue the boke wyth hym, LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.252

and why?  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.253

to reade in it all the dayes of hys lyfe, to learne to feare God,
and learne hys Lawes and other thynges, as it foloweth in the texte
wyth the appurtenaunces and hangynges on, that he turne not frome God,
neyther to the ryght hande, nor to the lefte.  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.254

And wherfore shal he do thys?  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.255

that he may lyue longe, he and hys children.  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.256

Hytherto goeth the texte.  LATIMER-E1-P2,55L.257

That I maye declare thys the better to the edifiynge of youre soules
and the glory of God, I shall desyre you to praye etc. <font>
Et $postquam sederit.  etc. <$$font> Before I enter into thys
<P_56L> place <paren> right honourable audience <$$paren> to furnysh
it accordyngly, whych by the grace of god I shal do at leysure,
LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.258

I woulde repete the place I was in last, and furnyshe it wyth a story
or two whyche I lefte oute in my last sermon.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.259

I was in a matter concerninge the sturdines of the Iewes, a frowarde
and styfnecked kynde of people, much lyke our Englyshe men nowe a dayes,
that in the minoritye of a Kynge, take vpon them to breke lawes and to
go by wayes.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.260

For when god had promised them a kynge, when it came to point they
refused hym.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.261

These men walked by walkes, LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.262

and the sayynge is many biwalkes, many balkes, LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.263

many balkes much stumblynge, LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.264

and where muche stumblynge is, there is sometyme a fal,
LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.265

howbeit ther were some good walkers among them, that walked in ye
kynges highe waye ordinarilye, vprightlye, playne Dunstable waye,
LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.266

and for thys purpose, I woulde shewe you an hystorye whiche is written
in the thyrde of the kynges.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.267

Kynge Dauid beynge in his chyldhode, an old man, in hys second chyldhode
, for al old men are twise chyldren, as the Prouerb is.  <font> Senex
bis puer.  <$$font> An olde manne, twyse a child, it happened wyth him,
as it doth oftentymes, when wicked men, of a Kinges chyldhode take
occasion of euyl.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.268

Thys Kynge Dauid beyng weake of nature and impotente, in so muche that
when he was couered with clothes, he coulde take no heate, was counsayled
of hys seruauntes to take a fayre yonge mayde to nouryshe hym, and to
keepe hym warme in hys bodye.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.269

I suppose she was hys wyfe.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.270

Howe be it he hadde no bodilye companie with hyr, LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.271

and wel she myghte be hys wyfe.  LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.272

For thoughe the scripture doeth saye.  <font> Non cognouit eam.
<$$font> He knewe hyr not, he had no carnal copulation with hyr yet it
sayeth not.  <font> Non duxit eam Vxorem.  <$$font> He maried hyr not.
LATIMER-E1-P2,56L.273

And I canne not thynke that king Dauid would haue hyr too warme hys bosome
in Bedde, except shee hadde <P_57L> bene hys wyfe, hauynge a dispensation
of God to haue as manye wyues as he woulde.  LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.274

For God had dispensed wyth theym to haue manye wyues.
LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.275

Wel, what happened to kyng Dauid in hys childhode, by ye chylde of
the deuyll?  LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.276

Ye shall heare.  LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.277

Kynge Dauid hadde a proud sonne, whose name was Adonyas, a man ful
of ambition, desyerouse of honoure, alwayes clymbyng, clymbynge.
LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.278

Nowe, whylse the tyme was of his fathers childhode, he wold depose hys
father, not knoweyng of hys fathers mynd, saying.  <font> Ego regnabo.
<$$font> I wil raigne, I wyll be kyng, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.279

he was a stoute stomaked chyld, a biwalker, of an ambitious mynde,
LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.280

he wold not consente to hys fathers frendes, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.281

but gate him a charet, and men to runne before it, and dyuerse other
adherentes to helpe hym forwarde, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.282

wordelye wise men, such as had bene before of hys fathers counsayle,
great men in the world, and some no doute of it, came of good wil
thynkynge no harme, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.283

for they woulde not thynke that he did it wythoute hys fathers wyll,
hauynge such greate men to set hym forth, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.284

for euery man $can $not {TEXT:cannot} haue accesse at al tymes to the
kynge to knowe hys pleasure, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.285

well: algates he would be Kynge, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.286

and makes a great feast, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.287

and thither he called Ioab the ryngleader of hys fathers armye, a worldly
wyse man, a bywalker, that would not walke the Kynges hye way, and one
Abiather the hyghe prieste.  LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.288

For it is maruayle if any mischeyefe be in hand, if a priest be not at
some ende of it, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.289

they toke hym as Kynge, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.290

and cried, <font> Viuat rex Adonias.  <$$font> God saue kynge Adonias.
LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.291

Dauid suffered all thys, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.292

and lette hym alone, LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.293

for he was in hys chyldhode a bedred man.  LATIMER-E1-P2,57L.294
