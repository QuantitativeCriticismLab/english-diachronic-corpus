the Scorby.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.3

Cap. 12.  <$$font> CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.4

<$$heading>

I can not heere well passe ouer this briefe note or obseruation of the
curing two seafaring men, which trauelled a long time vpon the seas ,
and there fell sicke of the Scorby, which infection as I gathered by
inquiry, was reputed principally vnto their rotten and vnholsome victuals,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.6

for they said their bread was musty and mouldie Bisket, their beere
sharpe and sower like viniger, their water corrupt and stinking,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.7

the best drinke they had, they called Beueridge, halfe wine and halfe
putrified water mingled togither, and yet a very small and short
allowance, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.8

their beefe and porke was likewise, by reason of the corruption therof,
of a most lothsome and filthy taste and sauor, insomuch that they were
constrained to stop their noses, when they did eate and drinke thereof :
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.9

moreouer their bacon was restie, their fish, butter and cheese
wonderfull bad, and so consequently all the rest of their victuals:
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.10

by means hereof, and likewise lacke of conuenient exercise, cleane keeping
and shift of apparell, and againe, being in an ill disposed climate,
and want of good aire: these causes and such like were the onely meanes
they fell into the Scorby, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.11

for their gums were rotten euen to the very roots of their teeth, and
their cheekes hard and swolen, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.12

their teeth were loose neere readie to fall out, their iawes very
painfull, their breath of a filthy sauor, that at what time I drest
their gums, and washed their mouthes, the sauor was so odious, that I
was scarse able to staie and abide it: CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.13

in like maner their legs were feeble, and so weake, that they were scarse
able to carrie their bodies: CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.14

moreouer, they were full of aches and paines, with many blewish &
reddish staines or spots, some broad and some small like flea bitings,
or the graines of a Pomegranate, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.15

like wise their legs were colde, hard, and swolen, which caused me to
fear a <font> Gangraena <$$font>, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.16

for coldnes in such extremities being in corrupt bodies full of euill
iuice, doth challenge putrification, which disease or sicknes, although
it be in some safely cured, yet experience daily proueth that a number
also die.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.17

Now the first thing that required helpe by Chirurgery was their gums,
and their legs, being the conioined cause, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,40.18

but for that I will proceede as orderly as I can in my writing, I will
begin with the antecedent cause inwardly, which was done and performed
by the aduise and counsell of learned Physitions, who very confidently
set me down their opinions for their maner & order of purging, <P_41>
with other remedies, as hereafter followeth: CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.19

First as I said, euacuation going before, to diminish the humors sore
abounding, it was therfore thought most meete to begin with blood letting
in the middle vain on the left arme, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.20

& I did then take from ech of them vii. or viij. ounces
of blood.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.21

The next day following they were also well purged with this purgation,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.22

<font> Rx. Diasenae {TEXT:dram_symbol} j. ss.
Sirr. fumariae, {TEXT:ounce_symbol} j. Aquae scabiosae,
{TEXT:ounce_symbol} iij. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.23

Misce.  <$$font> CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.24

and herewith they were purged.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.25

Also euerie seuenth or eight day they were likewise purged with the
pils of Famitorie {TEXT:dram_symbol} j. made into fiue pils,
so as I say, after they were well purged, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.26

then in the meane space, there was prepared for them in a readines this
drinke following, which continually they did drinke at their meales,
and also as often as they were desirous to drinke.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.27

The order and making thereof is thus: CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.28

first there must be prepared a cleane vessell of eight gallons, which
was filled full of new ale, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.29

and then was added to it of <font> Coclearia <$$font> or Scorby grasse a
pecke, being purely picked, and cleane washed, and also brused in a stone
morter, and after put into the vessell with the ale, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.30

then was added thereto of long Pepper {TEXT:ounce_symbol} j.
Cinnamon and Ginger of each halfe an ounce, of Saffron {TEXT:dram_symbol}
ij. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.31

all these spices were put into a fine linnen cloth or bag, and so hanged
in the ale, with the herbes aforesaid, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.32

and thus it rested two daies before they did drinke of it.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.33

And further it is to be remembred, that euery morning they did eate a
messe of this Almond milke being newly made, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.34

and it did them very much good.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.35

Rx. two spoonefuls of French barly, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.36

and seeth it in a reasonable quantitie of running water till it be soft
, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.37

then adde to it of Almonds blaunched ij. ounces,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.38

then take of this liquor a pound, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.39

and put to it of <font> Coclearia <$$font> or Scorby grasse, Fumitorie,
and water Cresses, of each halfe a handfull, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.40

but first mixe with the Almonds in the beating, of this liquor, for
feare the Almonds will turne to an oile, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.41

then boile all togither to the consumption of the third part,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.42

then adde to the straining, of fine Sugar {TEXT:ounce_symbol}
j. ss. of Rose water {TEXT:ounce_symbol} ij.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.43

let all these seeth a little, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.44

and then reserue it to your vse: CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.45

In like sort euerie euening towards fower of the clocke they did drinke
a good draught of posset ale, whereunto was added of the iuice of Scorby
grasse a spoonfull, with a little of the powder of Cinnamon and some
Sugar, and now and then in stead thereof a good draught of Woormwood wine.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.46

Their meates that they did eate was Mutton boiled, and somtimes Veale
and chickens, &c.  seasoned with veriuice made of grapes, and thickened
with ote meals, or the crums of white bread, with a few Currans, and
Raisons of the sunne.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.47

Moreouer, there was added of Scorby grasse, Fumitorie, water Cresses,
and Soldanella.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.48

Their bread was made of the finest wheate, and of a day old.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,41.49

Now heere note you well, that euerie day or second day, one hower after
they had receiued a certaine sume, the description heereafter <P_42>
followeth, then they did presently drinke of the aboue named Almond milke.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.50

And after their sweating was ended, I did immediately bathe their legs:
which done, I annointed them, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.51

and lastly I applied a plaister, which heereafter shall be also nominated.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.52

Now for that their gums were so exceeding stinking and rotten,
I did at the very beginning scarifie their gums with a fleame,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.53

then presently I did as it were touch, or wipe their gums gently ouer with
a certaine blewish water, which the goldfiners haue vsed for refining
their golde, and haue themselues no vse for it, the force and strength
being by them greatly consumed and wasted: for the which cause it is
called the weake water.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.54

After the vse heereof, I did cause them certaine times in the day and
in the night, to gargarise or wash their gums and mouthes with my lotion
published in my booke for the curing of <font> Lues Venerea, Cap.
6. <$$font> whereunto many times I mixed the sirr. of
Mulberies, q. s. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.55

Also I did at sundrie times vse of the afore named blewish water,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.56

and did take thereof {TEXT:dram_symbol} ss..  whereunto I did put
of Plantaine water {TEXT:ounce_symbol} viij. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.57

and heere with I did mundifie and clense their gums.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.58

Also it is knowen most certainly what great good is done in curing of
such rotten gums and sore mouthes, onely with this gargarisme, which is
published by <font> Iulius Palmerius <$$font>, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.59

& it is also set foorth of late by master <font> Banister <$$font>
in a booke, which he calleth his Antidotarie Chirurgicall,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.60

Rx. Hordei integri p. ij. Eupatorij, Nicotianae,
Plantaginis, Morscis gallinae, Ros. rub. ana m.
j. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.61

boile these together in Aqua lib. iiij. till the one part
be consumed, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.62

then adde thereto Mellis rosar. Sirr. rosarum siccarum
ana. {TEXT:ounce_symbol} iij. Aluminis vsti, Calcanti vsti,
ana. {TEXT:ounce_symbol} ss. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.63

boile all these with a walme or two, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.64

& so let it coole, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.65

and then keepe it to your vse.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.66

Also I haue found great good by the vse of this powder, which is published
by that reuerend learned man <font> Wyerus <$$font>, who hath written
most profoundly for the cure of the Scorby, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.67

take of salt CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.68

and burne it in a crucible, whereunto ye shall adde of the powder of
Pomegranate flowers, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.69

and so mixe them togither, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.70

& heerwith I did many times rub well their gums.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.71

Moreouer, I haue in times past vsed Vnguentum Aegyptiacum, and also
a powder called of some Puluis Alchimisticus, or Caput mortuum,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.72

it is the dead head, of Aqua fortis, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.73

I also after washed their mouthes with vinegar and salt water, q.
s. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.74

and by these meanes I haue cured manie sore mouthes specially in
children , when I was Chirurgion vnto the children in Christs Hospitall,
where I haue had twenty, or thirty infected with the Scorby at a time.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.75

After I had well mundified and cleansed the mouthes and gums of these two
men, then I did administer a certaine fume, by the aduice and counsell
of <font> D.D.  <$$font> which fume was receiued in at their mouthes by
a funnell after this manner, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,42.76

I did take of Mirrhae, Olibani, Assae faetidae ana.
{TEXT:dram_symbol} ij. Aceti vinaci lib. j. which
gums <P_43> were grosly beaten, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.77

then they were tied loosely in a fine linnen cloth, and so put into the
viniger, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.78

then there was prepared an earthen pot fit for the purpose, well glassed
or nealed, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.79

and at those times when it was to be vsed, there was prepared a funnell
made fit in widenes and compasse vnto the mouth of the said pot,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.80

& so it was well passed or luted togither, with this lute called of <font>
Schilauder <$$font>, and many other good distillers and Alcumists <font>
Lutum sapientie <$$font>, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.81

and it is prooued very necessary to ioine and conglutinate two vessels
togither seruing for distillations, or otherwise as afore said.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.82

Rx. Clay and Fullers haire, with whites of egs and sand,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.83

thus I ioined the pot & the funnel togither, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.84

and then I set it vpon a chafingdish of coles, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.85

and I let it boile gently, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.86

& then caused the patients to sit by in their beds one after another,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.87

& so they receiued into their mouthes the fume or smoke, that passed
foorth of the top of the said funnell, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.88

& this was vsed diuers mornings before they did take their Almond milke,
and also certaine times in the euening, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.89

and did sweate halfe an hower after it in their beds: which fume
was administred most chiefly to open their obstructions inwardly,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.90

and so being well cooled and dried with warme clothes, they did rise
out of their beds, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.91

and went to the bathing of their legs, and annointings as followeth,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.92

Rx. the flowers of Chammell, Pelilote and Woormewood, the leaues
of Coclearia, Water Cresses, and Brookelime, of each a handfull, of
the berries of Juniper two handfuls, of Malmsey a quart, running water
q. s. sweete butter a pound, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.93

these were boiled togither, to the consumption of the third part, which
bath did bring out in a short time a number of spots, which before lay
hid in the flesh, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.94

and heerewith very warme, they were a long time togither bathed, with
double woollen clothes of white cotton or baies, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.95

& then dried them very well, with hot linnen clothes:
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.96

and as I haue before mentioned, they were presently annointed somtimes
with Vnguentum Agrippae, and somtimes with Vnguentum Brioniae, or
Dialthaeae cum gum.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.97

and also their legs were all wrapped round with this plaister,
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.98

Rx. Emplastrum Deminio lib. ij. Gummi Armoniaci
lib. ss. being dissolued in Malmsey, CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.99

then put them togither, adding thereto Axungiae humani {TEXT:ounce_symbol}
ii. ss. CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.100

I boiled these togither to the forme of a plaister.
CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.101

I found also very much profit by the Cuminum plaister published in
this booke.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,43.102

And thus by the helpe of God and carefull diligence, they were both
perfectly cured, and diuers other persons of good account since
that time, onely by this maner and order of curing aforesaid, &c.

Friendly Reader, amongst sundry other special cures which I haue noted,
not onely in mine owne works and proceedings, but also in other mens of
greater yeeres, antiquitie, and experience in the art of Chirurgery,
this one cure following in my simple opinion and iudgement, is not to
be passed slightly ouer and buried in forgetfulnes, if it were but in
respect of the strangenesse and rareness of such a cure, and of the good
and happy successe that followed.  CLOWESOBS-E2-P2,44.109
