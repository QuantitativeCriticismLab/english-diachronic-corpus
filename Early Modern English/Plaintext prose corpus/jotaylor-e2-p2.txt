THE GREAT EATER, OR PART OF THE ADMIRABLE TEETH AND STOMACKS EXPLOITS
OF <font> NICHOLAS WOOD <$$font>, OF <font> HARRISOM <$$font> IN THE
COVNTY OF KENT.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C1.3

HIS EXCESSIVE <font> MANNER <$$font> OF EATING WITHOVT MANNERS, IN
STRANGE AND TRVE MANNER DESCRIBED, BY <font> JOHN TAILOR <$$font>.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C1.4

<$$heading>

Records and Histories doe make memorable mention of the diuersitie of
qualities of sundry famous persons, men and women, in all the Countries
and Regions of the world, how some are remembred for their Piety and
Pitty; some for Iustice; some for Seuerity, for Learning, Wisedome ,
Temperance, Constancie, Patience, with all the vertues Diuine, and morall:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C1.6

Some againe, haue purchased a memory for Greatnesse and Talnesse of body;
some for Dwarfish smalnesse; some for beautifull outsides, faire feature
and composition of Limbs and stature, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C1.7

many haue gotten an earthly perpetuity for cruelty and murther, as
<font> Nero, Commodus, <$$font> and others: for Leachery, as <font>
Heliogabalus: <$$font> for Drunkennesse, <font> Tiberius <$$font>
, <paren> <font> alias Biberius: <$$font> <$$paren> for Effeminacy,
as <font> Sardanapalus: <$$font> for Gluttony, <font> Aulus Vitellius
<$$font>, who at one supper was serued with two thousand sorts of fishes ,
and seuen thousand fowles, as <font> Suetonius <$$font> writes in his
ninth Booke, and <font> Iosephus <$$font> in his fifth Booke of the
Iewes warres.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C1.8

<font> Caligula <$$font> was famous for Ambition,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C1.9

for hee would bee ador'd as a God, <P_1,142.C2> though he liu'd
like a Deuill, poysoning his Vnkle, and deflowring all his Sisters:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.10

And in all ages and Countries, time hath still produc'd particular
persons, men & women, either for their vertues or their vices, to be
remembred, that by meditating on the good, we may bee imitating their
goodnesse, and by viewing the bad, we might be eschewing thier vices.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.11

To descend lower to more familiar examples, I haue knowne a great man
very expert on the Iewe-harpe; a rich heire excellent at Noddy, a Iustice
of the Peace skilfull at Quoytes; a Marchants wife a quicke Gamester
at Irish <paren> especially when she came to bearing of men <$$paren>
that she would seldome misse entring.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.12

Monsieur <font> La Ferr <$$font> a French-man, was the first inuentor of
the admirable Game of Double-hand, Hot-cockles, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.13

& <font> Gregorie Dawson <$$font> an English man, deuised the vnmatchable
mystery of Blind-man-buffe.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.14

Some haue the a gility to ride Poast, some the facility to runne Poast ;
some the dexterity to write Post, and some the ability to speake, poast:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.15

For I haue heard a fellow make a Hackney of his tongue,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,142.C2.16

& in a moment he hath gallop'd a <P_1,143.C1> Lye from <font>
China <$$font> to <font> London <$$font>, without Bridle or Saddle.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.17

Others doe speake poast, in a thicke shuffling kind of Ambling-trot,
and that in such speede, that one of them shall talke more in one
quarter of an houre, then shall be vnderstood in seuen yeeres.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.18

And, as euery one hath particular qualities to themselues, and dissonant
from others, so are the manners of liues <paren> or liuings <$$paren>
of all men and women various one from another; as some get their liuing
by their tounges, as Interpreters, Lawyers, Oratours , and Flatterers;
some by tayles, as Maquerellaes, Concubines, Curtezanes, or in plaine
English, Whores; Some by $their {TEXT:theit} feete, as Dancers, Lackeyes,
Footmen, and Weauers, and Knights of the publicke or common order of the
Forke; Some by their braines, as Politicians, Monopolists, Proiectmongers,
Suit-ioggers, and Stargazers; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.19

Some <paren> like the <font> Salamander <$$font> <$$paren> liue by fire,
as the whole Race of <font> Tubalcaine <$$font>, the <font> Vulcanean
<$$font> Broode of Blacksmiths, fire-men, Colliers, Gunners, Gun-founders,
and all sorts of mettle-men; Some like the <font> Cameleon <$$font>,
by the Ayre, and such are Poets, Trumpeters, Cornets, Recorders, Pipers,
Bag-pipers; and some by smoake, as Tabaconists, Knights of the Vapour,
Gentlemen of the Whiffe, Esquires of the Pipe, Gallants in <font> Fumo
<$$font>; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.20

Some liue by the Water as Herrings doe, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.21

such are Brewers, Vintners, Dyers, Mariners, Fisher-men, and Scullers ;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.22

And many like Moles liue by the Earth, as griping Vsurers, racking
Landlords, toyling Plowmen, moyling Labourers, painefull Gardners,
and others.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.23

Amongst all these before mentioned, and many more which I could recite,
this subiect of my Pen is not <paren> for his qualitie <$$paren> inferiour
to any: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.24

and as neere as I can, I will stretch my wit vpon the Tenters, to describe
his name and Character, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.25

his worthy Actes shall be related after <font> in due time duely <$$font>.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C1.26

And, Be it knowne vnto all men, to whom these presents shall come,
that I <font> Iohn Taylor <$$font>, Waterman of Saint <font> Sauiours
<$$font> in Southwarke, in the County of Surrey, the Writer hereof,
&c. will write plaine truth, bare and threed-bare, and almost
starke $naked $truth {TEXT:naked-truth}, <P_1,143.C2> of the descriptions
, and remarkable, memorable Actions of <font> Nicholas Wood <$$font> ,
of the Parish of <font> Harrisom <$$font> in the County of Kent, Yeoman,
for these considerations following.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.27

First, I were to blame to write more then truth, because that which is
knowne to be true, is enough.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.28

Secondly, that which is onely true, is too much.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.29

Thirdly, the truth will hardly be beleeued, being so much beyond mans
reason to conceiue.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.30

Fourthly, I shall runne the hazzard to bee accounted a great lyer,
in writing the truth.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.31

Lastly, I will not lye, on purpose to make all those lyers that esteeme
me so.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.32

Yet by your leaue, Master Critick, you must giue me licence to flourish
my Phrases, to embellish my lines, to adorne my Oratory, to embroder
my speeches, to enterlace my words, to draw out my sayings, and to
bumbaste the whole suite of the businesse for the time of your wearing.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.33

For though truth appeareth best bare in matters of Iustice, yet in this
I hold it decent to attire her with such poore raggs as I haue, in stead
of Robes.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.34

First then; the place of his birth, and names of his parents are to me
a meere <font> Terra incognita <$$font>, as farre from my knowledge, as
content from a Vsurer, or honesty from a Bawde, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.35

but if hee be no Christian, the matter is not much,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.36

hee will serue well enough for a man of Kent; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.37

and if his education had beene as his Feeding, it is euident he had been
of most mighty breeding; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.38

he hath gotten a soule name, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.39

but I know not if it came to him by Baptisme, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.40

for it is partly a <font> Nick <$$font> -name, which in the totall is
<font> Nicholas <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.41

I would abate him but a Saint, and call him <font> Nicholas Shambles
<$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.42

and were the goodnesse of his purse answerable to the greatnesse of his
appetite, out of all question, no man below the Moone would be a better
customer to a shambles then he, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.43

for though he be chaste of his body, yet his minde is onely vpon flesh ,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.44

he is the onely Tugmutton, or Muttonmonger betwixt <font> Douer <$$font>
and <font> Dunbarr <$$font>: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.45

for hee hath eaten a whole Sheepe of sixteene shillings price, raw at
one meale JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,143.C2.46

<paren> pardon me <$$paren> I thinke hee left the skin, <P_1,144.C1>
the wooll, the hornes, and the bones: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.47

but what talke I of a Sheepe, when it is apparantly knowne, that he hath
at one repast, and with one dish, feasted his Carkas with all manner
of meates?  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.48

All men will confesse that a Hogge will eate any thing, either fish,
flesh, fowle, root, herbe, or excrement, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.49

and this same noble <font> Nick Nicholas <$$font>, or <font> Nicholas
Nick <$$font>, hath made an end of a Hogge all at once, as if it had
bin but a a Rabbet sucker, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.50

and presently after, for fruit to recreate his palate, he hath swallowed
three peckes of Damsons, thus <paren> Philosophically <$$paren> by way
of a Chimicall Infusion, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.51

as a Hogge will eate all things that are to be eaten, so he in eating
the Hogge, did in a manner of extraction distill all manner of meates
thorow the Limbeck of his paunch.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.52

But hold a little, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.53

I would be loath to cloy my Reader with too much meate and fruit at once,
so that after your Sheepe, Hogge and Damsons, I thinke it best to suffer
you to pawse and picke your teeth <paren> if you haue any <$$paren>
whilst I spend a few words more in Paraphrasing vpon his surname.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.54

<font> Wood <$$font> is his Appellation, Denomination, or how you please
to tearme it.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.55

Some of the ancient Philosophers haue compared man to a Tree with the
bottome vpwards, whose roote is the braine, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.56

the Armes Hands, Fingers, Leges, Feete and Toes, are the Limbs, and
Branches, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.57

the comparison is very significant, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.58

many Trees doe bring forth good fruit, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.59

so doe some fewe men; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.60

Some stately Trees growe high and faire, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.61

yet stand for nothing but shades, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.62

and some men grow high and lofty, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.63

yet are nothing but shaddows; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.64

Some Trees are so malignant, that nothing can prosper vnder the compasse
of their branches; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.65

and some men are so vnlucky, that very few can thriue in their seruice.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.66

And as of one part of a Tree a Chaire of State may be made, and of
another part a carued Image, and of a third part a stoole of office;
So men, being compounded and composed all of one mould and mettle,
are different and disconsonant in estates, conditions, and qualities.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C1.67

Too many <paren> like the barren Fig-tree <$$paren> beare leaues
of hypocrisie, but no fruites of Integrity, who serue <P_1,144.C2>
onely for a flourish in this life, and a flame in that hereafter.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.68

So much for that: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.69

now to returne to my Theame of <font> Wood <$$font>, <paren> indeed this
last disgression may make my Reader thinke that I could not see wood for
trees <$$paren> what Wood he is, I know not, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.70

but by his face he should be Maple, or Crab-tree,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.71

and by his stomacke, sure he is heart of <font> Oake <$$font>;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.72

some say he is a <font> Medaler <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.73

but by his stature, he seemes like a low short <font> Pine <$$font>
, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.74

and certaine I am, that hee is a <font> Popular <$$font>, a well-tymberd
piece, or a store house for belly tymber.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.75

Now Gentlemen, as I haue walked you amongst the Trees, and thorow the
Wood, I pray set downe, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.76

and take a taste or two more of this Banquet.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.77

What say you to the Leafe or Flecke of a Brawne new kild, to be of
weight eight pound, and to be eaten hot out of the Bores belly raw?
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.78

much good doe you Gallants, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.79

was it not a glorious dish?  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.80

and presently after <paren> in stead of suckets, {COM:no_close_paren}
twelue raw puddings.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.81

I speake not one word of drinke all this while, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.82

for indeed he is no drunkard, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.83

hee abhorres that swinish vice: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.84

Alehouses, nor Tapsters $can $not {TEXT:cannot} nick this <font> Nick
<$$font> with froth, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.85

curtoll Cannes, tragicall blacke-pots, and double-dealing bumbasted
Iugges, could neuer cheate him, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.86

for one Pinte of Beere or Ale is enough to wash downe a Hog, or water
a Sheepe with him.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.87

Two Loynes of Mutton, and one Loyne of Veale were but as three Sprats
to him: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.88

Once at Sir <font> Warrham Saint Leigers <$$font> house, and at Sir <font>
William Sydleyes <$$font> he shewed himselfe so valiant of Teeth , and
Stomacke, that hee ate as much as would well haue seru'd and suffic'd
thirty men, so that his belly was like to turne bankerupt and breake, but
that the Seruing-men turn'd him to the fire, and anoynted his paunch with
Greace and Butter, to make it stretch and hold; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.89

and afterwards being layd in bed, hee slept eight houres,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.90

and fasted all the while: which when the Knight vnderstood, he commanded
him to be laid in the stocks, and there to endure as long time as he
had laine bedrid with eating.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,144.C2.91

<font> Pompey <$$font> the Great, <font> Alexander <$$font> the Great,
<font> Tamberlane <$$font> the Great, <font> Charlemagne <$$font> or
<font> Charles <$$font> the <P_1,145.C1> Great, <font> Arthur <$$font>
the Great: all these gat the Title of Great, for conquering Kingdomes,
and killing of men; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.92

and surely <font> eating <$$font> is not a greater sinne then rapine,
theft, manslaughter and murther.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.93

Therefore this noble <font> Eatalian <$$font> doth well deserue the Tytle
of <font> Great: <$$font> wherefore I instile him <font> Nicholas <$$font>
the Great <paren> Eater: <$$paren> JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.94

And as these forenamed Greats haue ouerthrowne and wasted Countreyes,
and Hosts of men, with the helpe of their Soldiers and followers; so hath
our <font> Nick <$$font> the Great, <paren> in his owne person <$$paren>
without the helpe or ayde of any man, ouercome, conquered, and deuoured
in one weeke, as much as would haue sufficed a reasonable and sufficient
Army in a day, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.95

for hee hath at one meale made an assault vpon seuen dozen of good Rabbets
at the Lord <font> Woetons <$$font> in <font> Kent <$$font> , which in the
totall is foure-score, which number would well haue suffic'd a hundred,
three-score and eight hungry Soldiers, allowing to each of them halfe
a Rabbet.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.96

<font> Bell <$$font>, the famous Idoll of the <font> Babylonians <$$font>
, was a meere imposture, a Iuggling toye, and a cheating-bable, in
comparison of this <font> Nicholaitan, Kentish Tenterbelly <$$font>
, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.97

the high and mighty Duke <font> All paunch <$$font>, was but a fiction
to him.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.98

<font> Milo <$$font> the <font> Crotonian <$$font> could hardly be his
equall: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.99

and <font> Woolner <$$font> of <font> Windsor <$$font> was not worthy
to bee his foot-man.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.100

A quarter of fat Lambe, and threescore Eggs haue beene but an easie
colation, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.101

and three well larded Pudding-pyes he hath at one $time {TEXT:time_time}
put to foyle, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.102

eighteene yards of black Puddings <paren> <font> London <$$font>
measure <$$paren> haue suddenly beene imprisoned in his sowse-tub.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.103

A Ducke raw with guts, feathers, and all <paren> except the bill & the
long feathers of the wings <$$paren> hath swomme in the whirlepole or
pond of his mawe, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.104

and he told me, that three-score pound of Cherries was but a
kind of washing meate, and that there was no tacke in them,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.105

for hee had tride it at one time.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.106

But one <font> Iohn Dale <$$font> was too hard for him at a place called
<font> Lennam <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.107

for the said <font> Dale <$$font> had laid a wager that he would fill
<font> Woods <$$font> belly, with good wholesome victuals for 2.
shillings, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C1.108

& a Gentleman that laid the contrary, did wager, that as soone as noble
<font> Nick <$$font> had eaten out <font> Dales <$$font> 2.
shillings, that he should <P_1,145.C2> presently enter combate with a
worthy Knight, called Sir <font> Lorne of Beefe <$$font>, & ouerthrow
him; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.109

in conclusion, <font> Dale <$$font> bought 6. pots of potent ,
high, and mighty Ale, and twelue new penny white loaues, which hee
sop'd in the said Ale, the powerfull fume whereof, conquer'd the
conquerour, rob'd him of his reason, bereft him of his wit, violently
tooke away his stomacke, intoxicated his <font> Piamater <$$font>, &
entred the Sconce of his <font> Pericranion <$$font>, blinde-folded him
with sleep; setting a <font> nap <$$font> of nine houres for manacles
vpon his <font> threed-bare eyelids <$$font>, to the preseruation $of
{TEXT:or} the rost Beefe, and the vnexpected winning of the wager.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.110

This inuincible <font> Ale <$$font>, victoriously vanquish'd the
vanquisher, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.111

and ouer our Great Triumpher, was Triumphant: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.112

But there are presidents enow of as potent men as our <font> Nicholas
<$$font>, that haue subdude Kings and Kingdomes, and yet they themselues
haue been captiu'd and conquer'd by drinke; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.113

wee need recite no more examples but the Great <font> Alexander <$$font>
, and <font> Holophernes <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.114

their ambition was boundlesse, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.115

and so is the stomacke of my Pens subiect, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.116

for all the foure Elements $can $not {TEXT:cannot} cloy him, fish from
the deepest ocean, or purest Riuer, fairest Pond, foulest Ditch, or
dirtiest puddle, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.117

he hath a receite for Fowle of all sorts, from the <font> Wren <$$font>
to the <font> Eagle <$$font>, from the <font> Titmouse <$$font>
to the <font> Estrich <$$font>, or <font> Cassawaraway <$$font>,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.118

his paunch is either a Coope or a Roost for them:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.119

He hath <paren> within himselfe <$$paren> a stall for the Oxe, a roome
for the Cow, a stye for the Hogge, a Parke for the Deere, a warren for
Coneies, a storehouse for fruit, a dayery for Milke, Creame, Curds,
Whay, Butter-milke, and Cheese: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.120

his mouth is a Mill of perpetual motion, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.121

for let the wind or the water rise or fall, yet his teeth will euer bee
grinding; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.122

his guts are the Rendez-vous or meeting place or Burse for the
Beasts of the fields, the Fowles of the Ayre, and Fishes of the Sea;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.123

and though they be neuer so wild or disagreeing in Nature, one to another,
yet hee binds or grindes them to the peace, in such manner, that they
neuer fall at odds againe.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.124

His eating of a Sheepe, a Hog, and a Duck raw, doth shew that
he is free from the sinne of nicenesse or curiosity in his Dyet.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,145.C2.125

<P_1,146.C1>

<paren> It had beene happy for the poore, if their stomacks had beene
of that constitution, when seacoales were so deare here.  <$$paren>
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.127

Besides, he neuer troubles a Larder, or Cupboord to lay cold meate in,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.128

nor doth he keepe any Cats or Traps in his house to destroy vermin,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.129

he takes so good a course, that he layes or shuts vp all safe within
himselfe; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.130

in briefe, giue him meate, and he ne'r stands vpon the cookery,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.131

he cares not for the Peacocke of <font> Sames <$$font>, the Woodcock
of <font> Phrygia <$$font>, the Cranes of <font> Malta <$$font>, the
Pheasants of <font> England <$$font>, the <font> Caperkelly <$$font>,

Vsquabah of <font> Ireland <$$font>, the Sawsedge of <font> Bolognia
<$$font>, the Skink of <font> Westphalia <$$font>, the Spanish <font>
Potato <$$font>, he holds as a bable, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.132

and the <font> Italian Figge <$$font> he esteemes as poyson.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.133

He is an English man, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.134

and English dyet will serue his turne.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.135

If the <font> Norfolk Dumplin <$$font>, and the <font> Devonshire
White-pot <$$font>, be at variance, he will atone them,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.136

the <font> Bag-puddings <$$font> of <font> Gloucester <$$font> shire
, the <font> Black-puddings <$$font> of <font> Shropshire <$$font>,
the <font> White puddings <$$font> of <font> Somersetshire <$$font>,
the <font> Hasty-puddings <$$font> of <font> Hamshire <$$font>, and
the <font> Pudding-pyes <$$font> of any shire, all is one to him,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.137

nothing comes amisse, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.138

a contented mind is worth all, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.139

and let any thing come in the shape of fodder, or eating stuffe, it is
welcome, whether it bee <font> Sawsedge <$$font>, or <font> Custard
<$$font>, or <font> Eg-pye <$$font>, or <font> Cheese-cake <$$font>
, or <font> Flawne <$$font>, or <font> Foole <$$font>, or <font>

, or <font> Fritter <$$font>, or <font> Flapiacke <$$font>, or <font>
Posset, Galley-mawfrey, Mackeroone, Kickshaw <$$font>, or <font> Tantablin
<$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.140

he is no puling Meacocke, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.141

nor in all his life time the queasinesse of his stomacke needed any
fawcy spurre or switch of sowre <font> Veriuce <$$font>, or acute <font>
Vinegar <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.142

his appetite is no straggler, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.143

nor is it euer to seeke, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.144

for he keepes it close prisoner, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.145

and like a courteous kind Iaylour, he is very tender ouer it, not
suffering it to want any thing if he can by any meanes procure it:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.146

indeede it was neuer knowne to be so farre out of reparations, that it
needed the assistance of <font> Cawdle, Alebery, Iulep , Culisse, Grewell
<$$font>, or <font> stewd-broth <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C1.147

onely a messe of plaine frugall Countrey <font> Pottage <$$font> was
alwayes sufficient for him, though it were but a <font> washing-bowle
full <$$font>, of the quantity of two pecks, which porrenger of his, I
my selfe saw at the signe of the white <P_1,146.C2> <font> Lyon <$$font>
at a Village called <font> Harrisom <$$font> in <font> Kent <$$font> ,
the Hostesse of which house did affirme, that hee did at once wash downe
that Bowle full of pottage, with nine penny loaues of bread, and three
Iugges of Beere.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.148

Indeed, in my presence <paren> after he had broken his fast <$$paren>
hauing <paren> as he said <$$paren> eaten one pottle of milke, one
pottle of potage, with bread, butter, and cheese: I then sent for him,
to the aforesaid Inne, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.149

and after some accomodated salutations, I asked him if hee could eate
any thing?  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.150

He gaue me thankes, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.151

and said, that if he had knowne, that any Gentleman would haue
inuited him, that he would haue spared his breakefast at home,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.152

<paren> and with that he told me as aforesaid, what he had eaten <$$paren>
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.153

yet neuerthelesse <paren> to doe me a courtesie <$$paren> he would shew
me some small cast of his office, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.154

for he had one hole or corner in the profundity of his storehouse, into
which he would stow and bestow any thing that the house would afford,
at his perill and my cost.  Whereupon I summoned my Hostesse with three
knocks vpon the Table, two stamps on the floore, with my fist and foot,
at which shee made her personall appearance with a low Curtsie, and an
inquisitiue What lacke ye?  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.155

I presently laid the authority of a bold Guest vpon her, commanding
that all the victuals in the house should be laid on the Table.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.156

She said, she was but slenderly prouided, by reason goodman <font>
Wood <$$font> was there, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.157

but what she had, or could doe, wee should presently haue:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.158

so the cloth was displaid, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.159

the salt was aduanc'd, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.160

sixe penny wheaten loaues were mounted two stories high like a Rampier,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.161

three sixe-penny Veale pyes, wall'd stiffly about, and well victual'd
within, were presented to the hazzard of the <font> Scalado <$$font>
, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.162

one pound of sweet butter <paren> being all fat and no bones <$$paren> was
in a cold sweat at this mighty preparation, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.163

one good dish of Thorneback, white as Alabaster or the Snow vpon the
<font> Scithian <$$font> mountaines, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.164

and in the Reare came vp an inch thick shyuer of a Peck house-hold loafe
; all which prouision were presently, in the space of an houre vtterly
confounded, and brought to nothing, by the meere and onely valourous
dexterity of our vnmatchable grand Gurmound.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,146.C2.165

<P_1,147.C1>

He couragiously past the Pikes, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.167

and I cleared the shot, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.168

but the house yeelded no more, so that my Guest arose vnsatisfied, and my
selfe discontented in being thrifty and sauing my money against my will.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.169

I did there offer him twenty shillings to bring him vp to me to my house
on the Bank-side, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.170

and there I would haue giuen him as much good meate, as he would eate in
tenne dayes, one after another, & fiue shillings a day every day, and at
the tenne dayes end, twenty shillings more, to bring him downe againe.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.171

I did also offer tenne shillings to one <font> Ieremy Robinson <$$font>
a Glouer <paren> a man very inward with him <$$paren> to attend and keepe
him company, and two shillings six pence the day, with good dyet and
lodging: all which were {at} once accepted, vntill <font> Wood <$$font>
began to ruminate and examine what seruice he was to doe, for these
large allowances {COM:no_period} JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.172

Now my plot was to haue him to the Beare-garden,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.173

and there before a house full of people, he should haue eaten a
wheele barrow full of Tripes, and the next day, as many puddings as
should reach ouer the Thames <paren> at a place which I would measure
betwixt <font> London <$$font> and <font> Richmond <$$font> <$$paren>
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.174

the third day, I would haue allowed him a fat Calfe, or Sheepe of twenty
shillings price, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.175

and the fourth day he should haue had thirty Sheepes Gathers,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.176

thus from day to day, he should haue had wages & dyet with variety;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.177

but he fearing that which his merits would amount vnto, brake off the
match, saying, that perhaps when his Grace, <paren> I guesse who he
meant <$$paren> should heare of one that ate so much, and could worke
so little, he doubted there would come a command to hang him: whereupon
our hopefull Beare-garden busines was shiuerd, and shatterd in pieces.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.178

Indeed he made a doubt of his expected performance in his quality,
by reason of his being growne in yeeres, so that if his stomack should
faile him publikely, and lay his reputation in the mire, it might haue
beene a disparagement to him for euer, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.179

and especially in Kent, where he hath long beene famous, hee would be
loth to be defamed; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C1.180

But as weake as he was, he said, that he could make a shift to destroy
a fat Weather of a pound in two <P_1,147.C2> houres, prouided that it
were tenderly boild, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.181

for he hath lost all his teeth <paren> except one <$$paren> in eating
a quarter of Mutton, <paren> bones and all <$$paren> at <font> Ashford
<$$font> in the County aforesaid, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.182

yet is he very quicke and nimble in his feeding,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.183

and will ridde more Eating worke away in two houres, then
tenne of the hungriest Carters in the Parish where he dwells.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.184

He is surely noble <paren> for his great Stomacke <$$paren> and
vertuous , chiefely for his patience in putting <font> vp much <$$font>;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.185

moreoeuer he is <font> thrifty <$$font> or <font> frugall <$$font>,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.186

for when he can get no better meate, he will eate Oxe Liuers, or a messe
of warme Ale-graines from a Brewhouse.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.187

He is prouident and studious where to get more prouision as soone as
all is spent, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.188

and yet hee is bountifull or prodigall in spending all hee hath at once:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.189

hee is profitable in keeping bread and meate from mould and Maggots,
and sauing the charge of salt, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.190

for his appetite will not waite and attend the poudring;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.191

his courtesie is manifest, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.192

for he had rather haue one <font> Farewel <$$font> then twenty Godbwyes:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.193

Of all things, hee holds fasting to be a most superstitious branch of
Popery, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.194

he is a maine enemy to Emberweekes, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.195

he hates Lent worse then a Butcher or a Puritan,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.196

and the name of Good-friday affrights him like a Bulbegger;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.197

a long Grace before meate, strikes him into a Quotidian Ague;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.198

in a word, hee could wish that Christmas would dwell with vs all the
yeere, or that euery day were metamorphoz'd into Shrouetuesdayes;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.199

in briefe, he is a Magazine, a store-house, a Receptacle,
a Burse, or Exchange, a Babel or confusion for all Creatures.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.200

Hee is no Gamester, neither at Dice, or Cards, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.201

yet there is not any man within forty miles of his head, that can play
with him at <font> Maw <$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.202

and though his pasture be neuer so good, he is alwayes like one of <font>
Pharoahs <$$font> leane Kine; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.203

he is swarty, blackish haire, Hawk-nosed <paren> like a Parrot, or a
Roman <$$paren> JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.204

hee is wattle-Iawde, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,1,147.C2.205

and his eyes are sunke inward; as if hee looked into the inside of his
intrayles, to note what custom'd or vncustom'd goods he tooke in , whilst
his belly <paren> like a Maine-sayle in a calme <$$paren> hangs ruffled
and wrinkled <paren> in folds and wrathes <$$paren> flat <P_1,148.C1>
to the mast of his empty carkasse, till the storme of aboundance
fills it, and violently driues it into the full sea of satisfaction.

<P_3,93.C1>

Sunday the <font> 26. <$$font> $of <font> $August <$$font>
{TEXT:'August_of'_in_italics} wee set sayle from <font> Graus end <$$font>
, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C1.210

and with various windes some large and some scarce, we happely past the
Seas, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C1.211

and sayled vp the Riuer or <font> Maze <$$font>, by the <font> Brill
<$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C1.212

and on the Wednesday following I arriued at <font> Roterdam <$$font> in
<font> Holland <$$font>, at which time the worthy Regiment of the right
honourable Colonell Sir <font> Horace Veere <$$font>, and the two noble
Earles of <font> Essex <$$font>, and <font> Oxford <$$font> departed from
thence in Martiall Equipage toward the Pallatinate Country, whose Heroick
and Magnanimous endeauours, I beseech the <P_3,93.C2> Lord of Hosts,
and God of battels to direct and blesse.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.213

The same day I went to the <font> Hage <$$font>, and from thence to <font>
Leiden <$$font>, where I lodged all night, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.214

and the morrow being Thursday the 30. of <font> August <$$font>
, I sayled from <font> Leyden <$$font> to <font> Amsterdam <$$font>,
where I saw many things worthy the noting, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.215

but because they are so neere and frequent to many of our Nation, I omit
to relate them, to auoid tediousnes: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.216

but on the Friday at night I got passage from thence toward
<font> Hambrogh <$$font>, in a small hoy, in the which we were
weather-beaten at Sea three dayes and nights before we arriued there.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.217

Saturday the eighth $of <font> September <$$font> I left <font> Hambrogh
<$$font>, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.218

and being carried day and night in Waggons, on the Monday night
following I came to an ancient towne called <font> Heldeshim <$$font>
, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.219

it standeth in <font> Brunswicke <$$font> Land, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.220

and yet it belongeth to the Byshop of <font> Collin <$$font>, where I
did obserue in their <font> Doome Kirke <$$font>, or Cathedral Church,
a Crowne of siluer 80. foote in Compasse, hanged vp in the body
of the Church, in the circuit of which crowne were placed 160.
waxe Candles, the which at Festiuall dayes, or at the celebration of
some high Ceremonies are lighted to lighten their darknesse or their
ignorance, chuse yee whether.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.221

Moreouer, there I saw a siluer Bell in their Steeple, of thirty pound
weight, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.222

and the Leades of their steeple shining and sparkeling with the Sunne
beames, they did affirme to mee to bee gold, the truth of which I am
doubtfull of.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.223

In this towne I stayed foure dayes JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.224

and on Friday the 14. of <font> September <$$font>, I went
sixe Dutch miles to the strong towne of <font> Brunswicke <$$font>,
where by reason of my short stay which was but two houres, I obserued
nothing worthy of memory, but their triple Wals, and double Ditches,
there artillery and fortifications, which they thinke to be impregnable
; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.225

besides, there I saw an old house of the Duke of <font> Brunswicke
<$$font>, with the statue of a golden Lyon, of a great bignesse, standing
aloft vpon a Piller, with the broken Wals, and houses, which the Dukes
Canon hath left there sixe yeares since, as tokens and badges of his fury,
and their rebellion.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,93.C2.226

From thence on the morrow, I went one Dutch mile further, to an ancient
towne called <P_3,94.C1> <font> Wolfunbottle <$$font>, where the Duke of
<font> Brunswicke <$$font> keepes his Court, in the which I and my fellow
could get no further admittance, then ouer a bridge into his outtermost,
or base Court; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C1.227

for his Souldiers seeing vs with Swords and Pistols, were fearefull
, belike, that wee would haue taken the fortresse from them,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C1.228

and therefore though we were but two Englishmen, yet they durst not let vs
enter; which made me call to remembrance the frequent, and dayly Egresse
and Regresse, that all people haue to his Maiesties Court of Great <font>
Britaine <$$font>, where none that are of any good fashion and aspect,
are debar'd entrance: when those inferiour Princeshouses are guarded with
hungry Halberdiers, and reuurend rusty bil-men, with a brace or two of
hot-shots; so that their Pallaces are more like Prisons, then the free
and Noble Courts of Commanding Potentates.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C1.229

After two dayes entertainment at <font> Wolfunbotle <$$font>, with an
English Marchant residing there, of good fame and credit, named Maister
<font> Thomas Sackuile <$$font>, I with my brother, and my fellow <font>
Tilbery <$$font>, and another man in my company, departed thither on
foot onward on our iourney towards <font> Bohemia <$$font>, in which
trauaile, what occurrences happened, and what things of note I saw,
were as followeth.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C1.230

Passing with many weary steps through the townes of <font> Rosondink,
Remling, Soulem, Hassen, Darsam <$$font>, and <font> Haluerstadt <$$font>,
<paren> which is all in <font> Brunswicke <$$font> land, <$$paren> but
this towne of <font> Haluerstadt <$$font> belongs to a Byshop so stiled,
who is Duke <font> Christian <$$font> brother to the now Duke of <font>
Brunswicke <$$font>, a long Dutch mile <paren> or almost sixe English
<$$paren> is a small towne or a Blecke called <font> Groning <$$font>
belonging to the Duke, in the which place I obserued two things worthy
of remembrance.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C1.231

First a most stately Pallace built with a beautifull Chappell, so
adorned with the Images and Formes of Angels and Cherubins, with such
exquisitenesse of arts best industry of caruing, grauing, guilding,
painting, glazing, and pauing, with such superexcellent workemanship of
Organs, Pulpit, and Font, that for curiositie and admirable rarenesse, all
the Buildings and Fabricks that euer I beheld, must giue it preheminence.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C1.232

I confesse that <font> Henry <$$font> the $seuenth $s {TEXT:seuenths}
Chappell at <font> Westminster <$$font>, Kings Colledge Chappell in
<P_3,94.C2> <font> Cambridge <$$font>, and Christ Church in <font>
Canterbury <$$font>, are beyond it in height and workemanship of stone :
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.233

for indeed this Chappell is most of wood gipps, and plaster of <font>
Paris <$$font>; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.234

but it is so guilded as if it had beene made in the golden age,
when gold was esteemed as Drosse, so that a man had need to weare a
vaile ouer his dazzling eyes, or else he can hardly looke vpon it.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.235

The caruing and painting seeme to out goe the arts of <font> Pigmalion ,
Apelles <$$font>, or <font> Praxiteles <$$font>, the pauing of the
chequered blacke and white marble, and the windowes glassed with
Chrystall: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.236

but all this great cost and shew is very little to the honour of God,
or the propagation of the Gospell, the edification of the ignorant.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.237

For in this Church of ease, there is no Seruice.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.238

If the painted Pulpit could preach, the dumbe Images might <paren>
perhaps <$$paren> haue a Sermon now and then, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.239

for scarce at any time there comes any body into the Chappell, but a
fellow that shewes the beauty of it for two pence or three pence a peece.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.240

In the same house, in a place or Celler built of purpose, is a great
tonne or Vessell of wood, that was 7 yeares in making & was vsed to be
filled with Rhenish wine: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.241

it is said to be twice as big as the vessell at <font> Heidelberg <$$font>
, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.242

and the hoops of it are twelue inches thicke, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.243

and the staues or bordes of it being as much; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.244

I went vp to the top of it with a Ladder of 18. steps,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.245

he that keepes it saith it will hold 160. tonnes.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.246

My fellow <font> Tilbery <$$font> did creepe in at the tap hole;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.247

it is in length thirty two foot, and in breadth a crosse 19.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.248

and verily I thinke that bable cost more money the making, then would haue
built a good ship, or founded an Almes house for 6. poore people.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,94.C2.249

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_3,95.C1>

From <font> Groning <$$font> wee trauailed to a Towne called <font>
Ashers Leauen <$$font>, to <font> Ashleauen <$$font>, to <font>
Kinderne <$$font>, to <font> Hall <$$font>, and so to <font> Leipzig
<$$font>, which is one of the chiefest townes in <font> Saxony <$$font>
, being famous for a yearely Mart that is yearely held there, where
to Merchants and other people from the most part of Christendome haue
annuall concourse: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C1.252

in this towne we stayd two dayes, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C1.253

and taking our leaue then of some English Merchants, who vsed vs kindly
, we there would haue hired a coach or waggon to <font> Prague <$$font>
; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C1.254

but all the <font> Saxon <$$font> coach men and carters were afraid
to looke vpon any part of <font> Bohemia <$$font>, because their Duke
is a profest enemy in armes against the King of <font> Beame <$$font>,
so that we were forced to hire a fellow with a wheele barrow 2.
dayes to carry our cloaks, swords, guns, pistols, & other apparell &
luggage which were our necessaries, to a towne called <font> Boorne
<$$font>, to <font> Froburge <$$font>, and so to another towne called
<font> Penigh <$$font>, where we cashierd our one wheel'd coach, & hired
a cart with two, which carried both vs and our baggage to <font> Chemnizt
<$$font> another towne in <font> Saxony <$$font>, from whence to a place
called <font> Shop <$$font> wee were faine to be our owne sumpter horses
walking on foot to the last towne in <font> Saxony <$$font>, called <font>
Marlenberg <$$font>.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C1.255

From thence passing vp and downe inaccessable mountaines, we came to a
wood, which parts <font> Bohemia <$$font> from <font> Saxony <$$font> on
the west, which wood is called by the people of those parts the <font>
Beamer Wolts <$$font> or <font> Wolt <$$font>, and is in breadth ten
English miles, and length further then I know how to discribe truely:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C1.256

but this much of it I dare affirme, that it is a naturall impregnable wall
to the kingdome of <font> Bohem <$$font>, which kingdome is all incompast
round with woods and mountaines, so that there is no passage on that
side of it, for any army to enter into it with munition and artillery,
all the wayes being vneuen, and the mountaine tops all boggs, mosses, and
quagmires, that great Ordnance or <P_3,95.C2> any heauy cariage either of
horse, car or waggon, will sinke and be lost.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.257

Besides, there are numbers past numbring of Firre trees, many standing,
and such store fallen of themselues, that any passage might easily be
stopped by laying the~ crosse the way.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.258

And of all my iourny, the trauell through that dismall wood was the most
heauy vnto me, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.259

for the trees grew so thicke, and so high, that the Sun was obscured,
and the day seemed night; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.260

in some places, the way was paued with swimming trees 2. miles
together on the tops of Hils, which now and then I slipping beside,
sunke to the middle in a Quagmire.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.261

When we had thus footed it, and trauailed past the hils & the woods,
<paren> being at the least 4. houres toyle <$$paren> and that we
might looke downe the mountaines, into the fruitfull Land of <font> Bohem
<$$font>, neuer did sight more reioyce vs, the lower Hils being all full
of Vineyards and the Vallyes corne and pasture; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.262

not an English mile distance, but a village euery way; and 20.
30. or 40. reekes or stacks of corne which their barnes
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} hold, in the space of euery houres iourney:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.263

in a word, euery thing that belonged to the vse and commodity of man
was and is there, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.264

and all the delightfull obiects to satisfie euery sence, is there
abundantly so that nature seemed to make that Country her store house
or granary, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.265

for there is nothing wanting, except mens gratitude to God for such
blessings.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.266

The first night we lodged there at a pretty towne called <font> Comoda
<$$font>, which towne, by negligence and occasion of fire, had fifty
houses burnt, two dayes before our comming thither, it beeing eleuen
Dutch miles from <font> Prague <$$font>.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.267

There we hired a waggon 7 dutch miles to a towne called <font> Slowne
<$$font> from whence we walked on foot a long 16. English miles
to <font> Prague <$$font>, which long looked for Citty wee could not see
vntill we came within an houres trauell of it: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.268

within halfe a dutch mile is a fearefull place, being frequented with
inhumaine and barbarous murderrers, that assault trauellers, first
shooting and murdring them, & after searching their pockets, where if
they haue money or not, all is one, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.269

it is but so many slaine: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.270

for these villains haue a wood and a deepe valley to shelter themselues
in, that they are hardly taken afterwards; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,95.C2.271

but if they chance at any time to be but apprehended, they <P_3,96.C1>
are racked & tortured to make them confesse, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.272

& afterwards their executions are very terrible.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.273

But <paren> I thanke God <$$paren> we past that place, & many other
as dangerous as that, where some were robbed & murdered <paren> as
report told vs <$$paren> both before vs, behind vs, and on each side:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.274

and we saw in our journy aboue 7. score Gallowses and wheeles
, where theeues were hanged some fresh, and some halfe rotten, &
the carkases of murtherers, broken limb after limb on the wheeles;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.275

and yet it was our happines only to see the dead villaines, & escape
the liuing.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.276

I came into <font> Prague <$$font> on Thursday the 7. of <font>
September <$$font>, whither if I had come but the Friday before, I had
seene a most fearfull execution of 2. notorious offenders, the
manner how, with their faults, as it was truely related to me by English
Gent. that saw it: I think it not much impertinent to relate.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.277

The one of them being taken, apprehended and racked, for ripping vp a
liue woman with child, & for taking the infant out of her body, did sow
a liuing puppy into her belly; all w=ch= he confessed he did, to make
properties for witch craft: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.278

and being further tortured, he confessed when and where he had committed
35. murthers more: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.279

the other in respect of him was but a petty offender,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.280

for he in all his lifetime had murthered but 14. For the
which execrable facts, their deserued executions were as followeth:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.281

First, they were brought out of the Iayle naked from the girdle vpward ;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.282

and so being bound fast on high in a Cart, that the spectators might
see them; then the Hangman hauing a pan of coales neere him, with red
hot pincers nip'd off the nipple of one breast; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.283

then he tooke a knife JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.284

and giues him a slash or cut downe the backe on one side from the shoulder
to the wast; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.285

and presently gaue him such another slash, three inches from the first ;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.286

then on the top he cut the slashes into one; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.287

and presently taking pincers, tooke hold of the crosse cut,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.288

& tore him downe like a Girse below the middle, letting it hang
downe behind him like a belt: after which he tooke his burning
pincers, & pluck'd off the tops of his fingers of one hand:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C1.289

then passing to another place of the Towne, his other nipple was plucked
off, the other side of his backe so cut and mangled, <paren> which they
call by the name of rimming, <paren> if it had beene riming, I would
never haue written but in prose <$$paren> his other fingers <P_3,96.C2>
nip'd of, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.290

then passing further all his toes were nip'd off with the burning pincers
after which he was enforced to come out of the Cart, and goe on foote vp
a steepe hill to the Gallowes, where he was broken with a wheele , aliue,
one bone after another, beginning at his legs and ending with his necke,
and last of all quartered and layd on the wheele, on a high post, till
Crowes, Rauens, or consuming time consume him.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.291

This was the manner of both their executions, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.292

but I speake of the greatest murtherer particularly, because it is
reported that all these torments neuer made him once to change countenance
, or to make any signe or action of griefe, to call to God for mercy,
or to intreat the people to pray for him; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.293

but as if he had beene a sencelesse stocke or stone, hee did most
scornefully, and as it were in disdaine, abide it; whilst the other
villaine did cry, rore, and make lamentation, calling vpon God often ;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.294

the difference was not much in their liues, and manner of their deaths ,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.295

but I am perswaded the odds was great in their dying.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.296

The Citty of <font> Prague <$$font> is almost circular or round, being
diuided in the middle by the Riuer of <font> Moldoue <$$font>, ouer
which is a faire stone Bridge, of 600. paces ouer, and at each
end a strong gate of stone: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.297

there is said to be in it of Churches & Chappels, 150.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.298

for there are great numbers of Catholiques, who have many Chappels
dedicated to sundry S=t=s.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.299

and I was there at 4. seuerall sorts of diuine exercises, <font>
viz. <$$font> at good Sermons with the Protestants, at Masse with
the Papists, at a Lutherans preaching, & at the Iewes Synagog; 3.
of which I saw & heard for curiosity, & the other for edification.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.300

The Iewes in <font> Prague <$$font>, are in such great numbers, that
they are thought to be of men, women, and children, betwixt 50. or
60000. who doe all liue by brocage and vsury vpon the Christians ,
and are very rich in mony and Iewels, so that a man may see 10.
or 12. together of them, that are accounted worth 20. 30
or 40000. l. a piece; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.301

and yet the slaues goe so miserably attired, that 15.
of them are not worth the hanging for their whole ward-ropes.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,96.C2.302

The Castle where the King and Queene doe keepe their Court, is magnificent
and sumptuous in building, strongly scituated and fortified <P_3,97.C1>
by nature and art, being founded on a high hill, so that at pleasure it
keepes the towne in command, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.303

and it is much more spacious in roomes for receipt in Gardens & Orchards,
then the Towre of <font> London <$$font>.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.304

I was in it dayly the space of 20. dayes,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.305

and saw it royally graced with the presence of a gracious King & Queene
, who were honorably attended by a gallant Courtly traine of Lords
and Ladies, and Gentles of the High <font> Dutch <$$font> and <font>
Bohemians <$$font>, & where was free & bountifull entertainment to
strangers in aboundance: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.306

I must euer humbly and thankfully acknowledge the Queenes Maiesties
goodnesse towards me, whose vndeserued fauours were helpfull vnto me
both there, and in my tedious iourny homeward.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.307

Moreouer there I saw <paren> & had in mine armes <$$paren> the King
and Queenes youngest Son Prince <font> Robert <$$font>, who was borne
there on the 16. of December last: a goodly child as euer I saw
of that age, whom with the rest I pray God to blesse; to his glory and
his Parents joy and comfort.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.308

{COM:verse_omitted}

The Citty of <font> Prague <$$font> hath in it <paren> by reason
of the wars <$$paren> thrice the number of its owne Inhabitants,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.310

and yet for all that, victuals is in such great plenty, that sixe
men $can $not {TEXT:cannot} eate three halfe penny worth of bread,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.311

and I did buy in the Market a fat Goose well roast for the valew of
9. pence English, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.312

and I and my brother haue dined there at a Cookes with good roasted meat,
bread & beere, so that we haue beene satisfied and left, for the valew
of fiue pence: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C1.313

a good Turky there may bee <P_3,97.C2> bought for two shillings,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.314

and for fresh fish I neuer saw such store, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.315

for in one market day I haue knowne in <font> Prague <$$font> 2000.
Carps, besides other fishes, which Carps in <font> London <$$font>
are fiue shillings a piece, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.316

& there they were for 8. pence or 10. pence at the most,
so that one of their fresh fish markets here, were worth at the least
5. or 600. pounds, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.317

and as for all other manner of wilde fowle, they are there in satiety,
besides their fruites are in such aboundance, that I bought a basket
of Grapes of the quantity of halfe a pecke for a penny and farthing,
and a hatfull of faire Peaches for as much, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.318

picked cowcombers, I haue bought a pecke for three pence,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.319

and muskmellions, there hath been cast fiue or sixe $carts load of them
in one day to their hogs.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.320

As concerning the dyet that is in the Kings Armies, I could neuer yet
heare any man complaine of want, but that it is more plentifull then in
the Citty, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.321

the greatest scarcitie hath beene to some sick souldiers, who being not
able to march with the Leaguers <paren> by reason of their weaknesse
<$$paren> they haue been left amongst the Boores, or Husbandmen in the
next villages, where their Languages not vnderstood, their succor hath
euer bin small, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.322

but for all this in the Campe hath euer bin a continuall cheapnes
of all things, the King most duely paying his Souldiers at the end
of euery month, hauing in his great Leaguer, vnder the conduct of
the Princes of <font> Hollock <$$font> and <font> Anhalt <$$font>
of foot and horse 43000. and at the least of carts and waggons
to carry prouision, and baggage for the Army, to the number of 18000.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.323

In his little Leaguer, vnder the leading of Count <font> Mansfelt
<$$font>, there are of Foot and Horse 7000. besides Carts and
Waggons for carriage, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.324

and yet for these great numbers of men and beasts, there is food in
all aboundance.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.325

In the Campe with <font> Graue Mansfelt <$$font> is the <font> Brittaine
<$$font> Regiment under the Col. Sir <font> Andrew Gray <$$font>
Knight, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.326

and in <font> Prague <$$font> I met with many worthy Gentlemen and
Souldiers which were there sicke, as the worthy Captaine <font> Bushell
<$$font>, Lieutenant <font> Grimes <$$font>, Lieutenant <font> Langworth
<$$font>, Ancient <font> Galbreath <$$font>, Ancient <font> Vandenbrooke
<$$font>, Master <font> Whitney <$$font> Master <font> Blundell <$$font>
, and others, all which did most courteously entertaine me, vnto whom
I must euer rest thankfull, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,97.C2.327

and they do affirme that now it <P_3,98.C1> hath pleased God to grant
their Souldiers recouerie, that they doe hope euery <font> Britaine
<$$font> Souldier doth retaine more good spirit, then three enemies of
what nation soeuer.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C1.328

Thus hauing shewed part of the best things in <font> Bohemia <$$font>
, the Court and City of <font> Prague <$$font>, it shall not bee
amisse if I relate a little merrily, of some things there tolerable
, some intolerable, some naught, and some worse than naught;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C1.329

for as euery Rose hath a prickle, and euery Bee a sting, so no earthly
Kingdome hath such perfection of goodnesse but it may bee iustly taxed
with imperfections.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C1.330

{COM:verse_omitted}

<P_3,98.C2.15>

Thus hauing staid in <font> Prague <$$font> almost 3. weekes, I
returned from thence homeward, on Tuesday, the 26. of September,
hauing in my company a widow <paren> and foure small children <$$paren>
whose Husband beeing an Englishman and the Kings Brewer for Beere,
deceased, and was buried there in <font> Prague <$$font> whilst I was
there: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.333

the good desolate woman hauing receiued reward after seuen yeares
Seruice there and at <font> Heidelbergh <$$font>, beeing desirous
to returne to her Country <paren> <font> England <$$font> <$$paren>
came with vs, with my brother, and my fellow <font> Tilbery <$$font>.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.334

We tooke two Coaches at the Castle of <font> Prague <$$font>,
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.335

and in a day and a halfe, we were carried 7. Dutch miles, to a
Towne in <font> Bohemia <$$font> <paren> standing on the riuer of <font>
Elue <$$font> <$$paren> called <font> Leutmeritz <$$font>, at w=ch= towne
we all layd our moneyes together, and bought a boat of 48. foot in
length, and not 3. foote in bredth, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.336

and because we did not know the riuer, we hired a <font> Bohemian <$$font>
waterman to guide vs 15. dutch miles, to the Towne of <font>
Dreason <$$font> in <font> Saxony <$$font>.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.337

But 4. miles short of that Towne, which was the first Towne in the
<font> Saxon <$$font> Country, called <font> Pirne <$$font> , where we
were stayed 5 houres without the Gates, till such time as the Burgamaster
would be pleased to examine vs: in the meane space our waterman <paren>
not daring to abide the terrible tryall of examination , because the Duke
of <font> Saxon <$$font> was in Armes against the King of <font> Beame
<$$font>, {COM:no_close_paren} he ran away, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.338

and left vs to bring the boat downe the riuer 600. English miles
our selues to <font> Hamburgh <$$font>.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.339

But now to close vp all, I will relate what rare dyet, excellent cookery
, and sweet Lodging we had in our journey in <font> Germany <$$font>
: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,98.C2.15.340

first, for our <P_3,99.C1> comfort, after very hard gatting of houseroome
our lodginge was euery night in straw, where lying together well littered,
we honestly alwayes left our sheets behinde vs: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.341

then our suppers at a table square, and so broad, that two men
can hardly shake hands ouer it, we being some twelue about it.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.342

Our first dish being a raw Cabbadge, of the quantity of halfe a pecke,
cut and chopped small, with the fat of resty bacon powred vpon it in
stead of oyle, which dish must be emptied before we could get any more :
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.343

Our second dish perhaps a pecke of boyld apples & hony, the Apples being
boyled skins, cores, stalkes & all: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.344

Thirdly 100. Gudgeons newly taken perhaps, yet as salt as if
they had beene three yeares pickled, or twice at the East Indies,
boyld with scayles, guts and all, and buried in Ginger like sawdust:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.345

a fresh pike as salt as brine, boyld in flat milke, with a pound of
Garlicke.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.346

This was the manner of the most part of our dyet;
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.347

and if we did aske them why they did salt their meate so vnreasonable,
there answer was, that their beere could not be consumed, except their
meate were salted extraordinarily.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.348

If a man finde fault or seeme distasted with there beastly dyet, he is
in danger to be thrust out of doores, and take vp his lodging in the
streets, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.349

and in the conclusion when dinner or supper is ended, then comes mine
Host, or his leather lip'd Froe, with a fawcy reckoning of what they
please, which sounds in our eares like a harsh Epilogue, after a bad
play; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.350

for what they say we must pay, their words are irreuocable <paren>
like the ancient Kings of <font> Persia <$$font> <$$paren>
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.351

and we must not question or aske how and how it can be so much, but pay
them their demand without grumbling, to halfe a farthing.  Which made mee
call to mind sixe seuerall principals, that doe belong to a traueller,
as patience, silence, warinesse, watchfulnesse and a good stomacke,
and a purse well moneyed; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.352

for if he want any one of these, <paren> perhaps <$$paren> the other
fiue will neuer bring him to his iournies end.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.353

A mans patience must be such, that <paren> though he be a Barron <$$paren>
he must beare all abuses, either in words, lodging, diet , or almost
any thing, though offered from or by a sowter, tinker, or a Merchant of
tripes and turneps; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C1.354

his silence must be, that <P_3,99.C2> though he beare and vnderstand
himselfe wronged, yet he must be as dumbe as a Gudgeon or a Whiting mop:
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.355

and though his mouth be shut, his warinesse must be such, that his
eares must be euer open, to listen and ouer-heare all danger that may
be complotted against him, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.356

his watchfulnesse must be so, that he must seldom sleepe with both
his eyes at once, least his throat be cut before he wake againe.
JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.357

But for his stomacke, hee must eat grasse with a horse, and drasse with
the hogs, JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.358

for hee that $can $not {TEXT:cannot} eate pickel'd herring broth,
and dirty puddings, shall many times fast by authority, and goe to bed
without his supper: JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.359

and last of all he must haue <font> Fortunatus <$$font> or a Prince
his purse, that must be <paren> like a Drunkards dagger <$$paren> euer
drawne , to pay bountifully for such wash and graines, as his valiant
stomacke hath ouercome, conquered and deuoured; JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.360

but of this a little in verse.  JOTAYLOR-E2-P2,3,99.C2.361

{COM:verse_omitted}

With this kinde of lodging and dyet, and with tedious labour sometimes
night and day; wee came in 14. dayes 607. miles from <font>
Prague <$$font> in <font> Bohemia <$$font>, to <font> Hambrogh <$$font>
on the hither skirts of <font> Germany <$$font>, the Riuer hauing aboue
1000. shelues and sands, and 800. Ilands, so that a man
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} see on which side of them to goe, there being
240. mils chained in boats on the first streame, and a number
numberlesse of Oakes & other trees sunke with the violence of the Riuer,
and sometimes fogs & mists that we could not see a boats length from
vs : besides great Rockes, and stones that were falne into the water,
