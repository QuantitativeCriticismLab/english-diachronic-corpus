CHAP. II.  HOOLE-E3-P2,233.3

<font> How the Master should maintain his Authority amongst his Scholars.
<$$font> HOOLE-E3-P2,233.4

<$$heading>

<font> Authority is the true mother of all due order, <$$font> which
the Master must be careful in every thing to maintain, HOOLE-E3-P2,233.6

otherwise he may command what he pleaseth, HOOLE-E3-P2,233.7

but withall, he must give the Scholars liberty to do what they list.
Which what an horrible confusion in their places, what insufferable
<P_234> neglect of their tasks, what unrulinesse in point of behaviour ,
what perpetual torment to the painful Master, and his Ushers, and what
unavoydable disgrace it bringeth upon a Schoole, let them that are Actors,
or Spectators thereof, give testimony {of}.  HOOLE-E3-P2,234.8

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,234.9

That therefore the Master may have all his lawful commands put in
execution with due alacrity, and his decent <font> orders <$$font>
diligently observed, I conceive it requisite, that, 1. He be
sure in all thinges to <font> behave as a Master over himself <$$font>
, not only by refraining those enormities and grosser faults, which may
render him scandalous to every one, but <font> checking his own Passions ,
especially <$$font> that of <font> Anger <$$font>; HOOLE-E3-P2,234.10

and if at any time he seem to have cause to be provoked to it, and feel
it to come too violently upon him, let him rather walk aside awhile out
of the Schoole to divert it, then expresse it openly amongst his Scholars
by unseemly words or gesturs.  HOOLE-E3-P2,234.11

He should indeed endeavour to behave himself unblameably in all
Christian-like conversation before all men, but so amongst his Scholars,
that they may have much wherein to imitate him, but nothing whereby to
disgrace him.  HOOLE-E3-P2,234.12

And towards his neighbours, his affability should be such, as to win
their love and respects, <P_235> so that they may be ready at all times
to countenance the Masters well-doing, and to vindicate the credit of him
and his Schoole, when they hear it unjustly traduced.  HOOLE-E3-P2,235.13

2.  HOOLE-E3-P2,235.14

When he commands, or forbids any thing to be done, he should acquaint
his Scholars with the end intended, and the benefits or inconveniences
which attend such, or such a course.  HOOLE-E3-P2,235.15

For <font> children <$$font> have so much use of reason as to <font>
delight to heare perswasive arguments of reason, though the declivity
of corrupt nature makes, that they do not much minde them, <$$font>
where there is no feare of a rod for doing amisse.  HOOLE-E3-P2,235.16

Yet sometimes it may be best to say onely, <font> Do this <$$font>, or
<font> do it not <$$font>, where you think it of no concernment to them
to know the reason, and would make trial of their readinesse to obey,
without asking <font> why or wherefore.  <$$font> HOOLE-E3-P2,235.17

3.  HOOLE-E3-P2,235.18

One main way to bring Scholars to a loving and awfull respect of their
Master, is for him to shew himselfe at all times pleasing and chearful
towards them, and unwilling to punish them for every error; but withall
to carry so close an eye upon all their behaviour, that he can tell them
privately, betwixt himself and them alone, of many faults they commit,
when <P_236> they think he knowes nothing, HOOLE-E3-P2,236.19

and let them see how he dare correct them for the like offences when they
presume to commit them again, and especially if they behave themselves
stubbornely before their fellowes.  HOOLE-E3-P2,236.20

Yet to win a boy of a more stubborne spirit, it is better sometimes to
forbeare blowes, when you have him submit to the rod, then to punish
him so for a fault, as to make him to hate you, and out of a despight
to you to do the like, or a worse mischiefe.  HOOLE-E3-P2,236.21

And when any general misdemeanour is committed, the Master should shew
himselfe impartial towards all, so as either to pardon or punish all.
HOOLE-E3-P2,236.22

But in afflicting punishments, as he should let none escape, so he should
let the most untoward feele the most smart; HOOLE-E3-P2,236.23

but beware he deal not rigorously, much lesse cruelly with any;
HOOLE-E3-P2,236.24

for that will cause an utter dislike in all the Scholars towards the
Master, fearing he will deale so with them, in case they so offend,
and thinking it to be no argument of love, where severity of correction
is used.  HOOLE-E3-P2,236.25

4.  HOOLE-E3-P2,236.26

But nothing works more upon good natured children, then frequent
encouragments and commendations for well-doing; HOOLE-E3-P2,236.27

and therefore, when any taske <P_237> is performed, or order observed
according to his minde, the Master should commend all his Scholars, but
especially the most observant, and encourage the weak, and timerous ,
and admonish the perversest amongst them to go on in imitating their
example, in hopes of finding as much favour at his hands, as they see
them to have.  HOOLE-E3-P2,237.28

5.  HOOLE-E3-P2,237.29

In some places a Master is apt to be molested with the reproachfull
clamours of the meaner sort of people, that $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
<paren> for the most part <$$paren> endure to have their children
corrected, be the fault never so heinous, but presently they must come
to the Schoole to brave it out with him; which if they do, the Master
should there in a calme manner admonish them before all his Scholars, to
cease their clamour, and to consider how rash they are to interrupt his
businesse, and to blame him for doing that duty to which he is entrusted
by themselves, and others, their betters: HOOLE-E3-P2,237.30

But if they go about to raise scandalous reports upon him, he may do well
to get two or three judicious neighbours to examine the matter, and to
rebuke the parties for making so much adoe upon little or no occasion.
HOOLE-E3-P2,237.31

Thus we <P_238> shall see Scholars abundantly more to respect the Master
, when they know how grossely he is apt to be wronged by inconsiderate
persons, and that wise men are ready to vindicate his cause.  Whereas if
they once see their Master liable to every bodies censure, and no man
take his part whatever is said of him, they themselves will not care
what tales they make to his utter disgrace, or ruine; especially, if he
have been any whit harsh towards them, and they be desirous to out-slip
the reines of his Teaching and Government.  HOOLE-E3-P2,238.32

<heading>

CHAP. III.  HOOLE-E3-P2,238.34

<font> Of Schoole-times.  HOOLE-E3-P2,238.35

Of Scholars going forth of the Schoole, and of Play dayes.  <$$font>
HOOLE-E3-P2,238.36

<$$heading>

Though in many Schooles I observe six a clock in the morning to be the
hour for children to be fast at their Book, yet in most, seven is the
constant time, both in Winter and Summer, against which houre, it is
fit every Scholar should be ready at the Schoole.  HOOLE-E3-P2,238.38

And all they that come before seven, should be permitted to play <P_239>
about the Schoole, till the clock strike, on condition they can say
their parts at the Masters coming in; HOOLE-E3-P2,239.39

else, they are not to play at all, but to settle to their books, as soon
as they come.  HOOLE-E3-P2,239.40

But here the Master is to take heed, that he be neither too rigorous
with those of weaker age or constitution for coming somewat tardy;
nor indulgent towards those, who through manifest sloth, and frequent
loytering, neglect the houre.  HOOLE-E3-P2,239.41

For in the one it will breed a daily timerousnesse, HOOLE-E3-P2,239.42

and in the other it will make way to licentiousnesse; HOOLE-E3-P2,239.43

and on the one side Parents will clamour, HOOLE-E3-P2,239.44

on the other side the Schoole will receive disgrace.  HOOLE-E3-P2,239.45

However the best is to be as strict as possibly may be, in seeing that
every Scholar come at the just houre, and to note it as a punishable
fault in him that cometh late; except he bring a note of excuse from
his Parents, or Host's hand, and a promise withall, that he shall not
offend often in that kind.  HOOLE-E3-P2,239.46

It is not amisse for every Scholar in every Form to put down his name
in a book <paren> kept common for that purpose <$$paren> so soon as he
comes to Schoole every day, that it may be upon record, whether <P_240>
he used to come with the foremost or the hindmost, and how often he was
absent from the Schoole; HOOLE-E3-P2,240.47

likewise every Scholars name should be called over according to the Bill
every Schole hour, HOOLE-E3-P2,240.48

and they that are present should answer for themselves, by saying <font>
Adsum <$$font>, HOOLE-E3-P2,240.49

and his next fellow should give notice of him that is absent, by saying
<font> Abest <$$font>.  HOOLE-E3-P2,240.50

The common time of dismissing Scholars from Schoole in the fore-noons,
is eleven a clock every day, and in the after-noons, on Mondaies,
Wednesdaies, and Fridaies, five a clock, but on Tuesday after-noons,
foure; and on Thursdayes, three.  Touching which, a care would be taken
that the taskes of every Form may be fully dispatched rather a little
before those houres then after; that then the Scholars which intend
writing or cyphering, or the like, may go to the Writing-schoole, as
they yet use to doe about <font> London <$$font>.  HOOLE-E3-P2,240.51

Neither would I have the Scholars to be so precisely observant of the
clock, as just upon the first stroke of it to rush out of the Schoole:
HOOLE-E3-P2,240.52

but notice being given to the Master that it is stricken, and he having
given the word for dismissing the Schoole, all the Scholars should come
<P_241> one by one orderly out of their seats according to their Forms
<paren> the lowest beginning first, because they are commonly next the
doore <$$paren> and salute him with their hats in their hands, and so
quietly depart out of the Schoole without thrusting, or striving one to
get out before another.  HOOLE-E3-P2,241.53

It were good if there were hour-glasses in the School, to give notice
how the time goes on.  HOOLE-E3-P2,241.54

And for their ready going home, or to the writing Schoole, there should be
private Monitors appointed to inform the Master, so soon as they return
to the Schoole again, who they are that neglected their duty therein.
HOOLE-E3-P2,241.55

That space of intermission about nine and three a clock, which is
used at <font> Westminster Schoole <$$font>, and some others, and
is so much commended by <font> Mr. Brinsley <$$font> <paren>
<font> Chap. 33 of his Grammar Schoole <$$font> <$$paren>
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} so well be observed, nor is it so requisite in
those Schooles, in which Scholars meet not till seven in the morning;
HOOLE-E3-P2,241.56

for the variety of their several tasks, will take away that tediousnesse
that seems to accurre by the length of time, HOOLE-E3-P2,241.57

and those <font> Subsidiary Books <$$font> provided for the lower Formes ,
will prevent the over-toyling of themselves by their <P_242> present work.
HOOLE-E3-P2,242.58

And that those disorders which usually befall in Scholars running forth
in Schoole-time, may be somewhat remedied, this or the like course may
be taken.  HOOLE-E3-P2,242.59

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,242.60

Let it be not lawful for above one boy in twenty to go forth at once;
HOOLE-E3-P2,242.61

and at his going forth, let every one come to the Master, or that Usher to
whose charge he belongs, and in his hearing repeat four or six Vocabula's
or phrases, which he hath not said before, and then lay down his book,
with his name writ in it in a place appointed within the Masters view,
that so it may be knowne at once, both how many, and who are out of
doores, and how long they tarry abroad.  HOOLE-E3-P2,242.62

At their coming in, they should again repeat the like number of Vocabula's
and Phrases, as they did at their going forth.  HOOLE-E3-P2,242.63

The Master should do well now and then to send a privie spie, who may
truly observe and certifie him, how every scholar spendeth his time
abroad, HOOLE-E3-P2,242.64

and if any be found to go forth upon no occasion, or to truant it without
doors, let him be censured or reproved, according to his demerits.
HOOLE-E3-P2,242.65

3.  {COM:sic} HOOLE-E3-P2,242.66

The granting of a Play-day, is to <P_243_misnumbered_as_242> be referred
wholly to the discretion of the Master, who must in this be as fearfull to
work his Scholars hinderance, and the Schooles discredit, as {he_must_be}
willing by such a courtesie to gratify his deserving friends; who if they
be any whit reasonable, will be easily satisfied with a just excuse of
denial; HOOLE-E3-P2,243_misnumbered_as_242.67

but if they be unreasonably importunate, they ought to be served with
as unreasonable a nay-say; so that Play-dayes should be rarely granted,
except to such as may seem to claime more then ordinary interest in
the Schoole, and to whom the Master is bound to shew his due respects,
especially before his Scholars.  HOOLE-E3-P2,243_misnumbered_as_242.68

In places of great resort, and where often sollicitation is used to be
made for play <paren> especially by mothers that come to visit their
children which are tabled at Schoole <$$paren> it were good that a
piece of an afternoon were designed constantly afore-hand, on which
<paren> in case any suit should be made <$$paren> the Scholars might
have leave to play; but if not, that they be held to their Books.
HOOLE-E3-P2,243_misnumbered_as_242.69

Yet if there have not a Play-day been granted, nor a Holy day intervened
for some weeks together, the Master may of himself propound to his
Scholars, that in <P_244> case they performe all their Tasks very well
and orderly, so as to dispatch them by such an hour on such a day,
they shall play the remainder thereof, HOOLE-E3-P2,244.70

& then <paren> as at other times also when a Play-day is intended
<$$paren> one of the upper Form <paren> at least <$$paren> should make
a Petitory Oration to the Master, $for {TEXT:or} them that come to
crave play; and another, a Gratulatory speech, after leave is obtained.
HOOLE-E3-P2,244.71

Where both Thursdayes and Saturdayes in the afternoons are halfe
Holy-dayes, I think Tuesdayes the fittest, on which to grant play;
HOOLE-E3-P2,244.72

in other places, Thursdayes may seem the best.  HOOLE-E3-P2,244.73

But this I leave to the discretion of the Master, who knoweth what is
most convenient for his own Schoole.  HOOLE-E3-P2,244.74

Now in granting a Play-day, these directions may be useful.  1.
That there be never more then one Play-day granted in one week, and that
onely when there is no Holy-day in that week, and when the weather also
is clear and open, and the ground some what dry.  2. That no Play
be granted till one a clock <paren> at the soonest <$$paren> when all
the Scholars are met, and Orations have been said.  3. That all
the Scholars be dismissed <P_245> orderly in some close <paren> or other
place appointed for such a purpose <$$paren> near the Schoole, where they
may play together, and use such honest and harmlesse recreations, as may
moderately exercise their bodies, and not at all endanger their health.
HOOLE-E3-P2,245.75

And because some boyes are apt to sneak home, or straggle from the rest
of their fellowes out of their bounds, prescribed them to play in; you
may do well to give order to him that hath the Bill of all the names,
to call it over at any time amid their sport, and to take notice of
all such as have absented themselves, & to give you an account of them,
when they return into the Schoole; which should be upon Play-daies before
five of the clock, that they may blesse God for his provident hand over
them that day, and so go home.  HOOLE-E3-P2,245.76

And that the Master may sometimes see into the various disposition
of children, which doth freely discover it selfe by their company,
and behaviour at play; he may now and then take occasion to walk at a
distance from them, or <paren> if he come nearer <$$paren> to stand out of
their sight, so as he may behold them in the throng of their recreations,
and observe their <P_246> gesture and words, which if in any thing they
be not as becometh them, he may afterwards admonish them in private to
behave, or speak otherwise.  HOOLE-E3-P2,246.77

But an especial care must be taken, and a charge accordingly often
given, that your Scholars do at no time play with any but their own
Schoole-fellowes, or other ingenuous children about home; which their
Parents or Friends know, and whom they are willing should be admitted
into their company; HOOLE-E3-P2,246.78

for besides the evil which may be contracted by learning corrupt discourse
, and imitating them in many shrewd turns: boyes that are under little
or no command, will be very subject to brabble and fight with Scholars,
and the rather because they know the Master will not allow his Scholars
at all to quarel, HOOLE-E3-P2,246.79

and if they can do them any maime, they will attempt it, that the Master
may have occasion to call them to account for it.  So perverse is our
corrupt nature <paren> especially <$$paren> where education hath no sway.
HOOLE-E3-P2,246.80

CHAP. IV.  HOOLE-E3-P2,247.83

<font> Of Admission of Scholars; of Election of Forms; and of Scholars
orderly sitting, and demeanour in their seats, when they are at Schoole.
<$$font> HOOLE-E3-P2,247.84

<$$heading>

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,247.86

<font> No children should <$$font> <paren> as I have formerly said
<$$paren> <font> be admitted into a Grammar Schoole, but such as can
readily read English, and write a legible hand or at least be willing
to learn to write, and to proceed in learning Latine.  <$$font>
HOOLE-E3-P2,247.87

And it is therefore best to try, in the presence of their Parents or
friends that bring them, what they can do, by causing them to read
or write if they can before them, that themselves may be Judges of
their present strength or weaknesse, and expect proficiencie from them
according as they see their capacity, not hastening them on too fast,
and rating at them daily, because perhaps in their judgements they do
not learn so well as their neigbours children.  HOOLE-E3-P2,247.88

The best is to admit of young beginners <P_248> onely once every year,
and then to take in all that can be gotten from the Petty-Schooles;
HOOLE-E3-P2,248.89

for company will encourage children to adventure upon an uncouth course
of learning, seeing the more the merrier; HOOLE-E3-P2,248.90

and any discreet Parent will be easily perswaded to forbear his son
a while when he considereth it will be more for his profiting to have
company along with him, as he learneth, and he may be daily bettered in
reading English, and forwarded by learning to write, before he come from
the Petty-Schoole.  HOOLE-E3-P2,248.91

The fittest season of the year for such a general admission of little
ones into the Grammar-Schoole, doth seem to be about Easter; partly
because the higher boyes are usually then disposed of to Trades, or
the Universities, and partly, because most children are then removed
from one Schoole to another, as having the Summer coming on for their
encouragement.  HOOLE-E3-P2,248.92

When you have thus admitted a company of boyes together, you may let
those that can read best, obtain the higher places, till they come to
get the Rudiments of Latine without book, HOOLE-E3-P2,248.93

and then you may rank them into a <P_249> Form.  HOOLE-E3-P2,249.94

Because, 2. It is a main help to the Master, and a furtherance
to all the Scholars, that the whole Schoole be reduced into Formes,
HOOLE-E3-P2,249.95

and those also as few as may be, respecting the different years, and
capacity of each Scholar.  HOOLE-E3-P2,249.96

And if there were six hundred Scholars or more in a Schoole, they might
all fitly be ranked into six Forms, by putting those of equal age and
abilities together, HOOLE-E3-P2,249.97

and the toyle in hearing Parts, or Lessons, and perusing Exercises,
<paren> as I will shew anon <$$paren> would not be much more with an
hundred orderly placed, and well behaved in a room to themselves apart,
then with three or foure single boyes in several employments.  Not onely
because the Master or Ushers do thus at once impart themselves to all
alike, and may bestow more time amongst them in examining any Task;
but also because by this means Aemulation <paren> as a main quickner
of diligence <$$paren> will be wrought amongst them, insomuch as the
weakest Scholar amongst them will be loth to lagge alway behinde the
rest; HOOLE-E3-P2,249.98

and there is none so stupidly blockish, but by help of company will learn
that which he would not <P_250> obtain being alone, HOOLE-E3-P2,250.99

and I have seen the very hindmost oftentimes to help all his fellowes
at a dead lift.  HOOLE-E3-P2,250.100

The Teachers constant care should be in every Form, as to direct and
examine every particular boy, so to help forward the weakest, that in
every thing he doth, he may understand himself, HOOLE-E3-P2,250.101

and it is not to be said, with what alacrity they will all strive to
out-doe one another, so that sometimes he that cometh behinde all the
rest, will be as fit to make a leader of the Forme, as those that are
the foremost in it.  HOOLE-E3-P2,250.102

To provoke them all therefore to emulation, and that none may complain,
or think himself injured by being left behinde; use constantly once at
the end of a moneth, and when all your Scholars are together to make a
free new choyce in every Forme, after this manner.  HOOLE-E3-P2,250.103

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,250.104

Let every Scholar in the Forme give his own voyce, concerning which boy
he thinketh to be the best proficient, and ablest for the present to
lead the company; HOOLE-E3-P2,250.105

and having set him aside, let them all passe their voyces again
, concerning whom they judge fittest to stand next to him.
HOOLE-E3-P2,250.106

2.  HOOLE-E3-P2,250.107

Then set these two opposite <P_251> one to another, so as the better
Scholar may take the leading of the upper side, on your right hand,
and the other, the leading of the lower side, on your left hand.
HOOLE-E3-P2,251.108

3.  HOOLE-E3-P2,251.109

And that there may not be much inequality in the sides, let the lower
leader have the first call, and liberty to take what boy he thinketh
the strongest, out of all the rest, HOOLE-E3-P2,251.110

and then let the higher leader have the next call, and liberty to take
whom he liketh; HOOLE-E3-P2,251.111

and so let them proceed to call by course, till they have <paren> like
ball players <$$paren> ranked all their fellowes to their sides, and so
strongly and evenly set themselves in a posture one side against another
, that it may be hard for any one to judge, whether is the stronger.
HOOLE-E3-P2,251.112

By thus choosing amongst themselves, they will be all so well pleased,
that the Master shall never be blamed for endeavouring to preferre one
boy before another, or keeping of any back, that would seem to go faster
then his fellowes at his Book.  HOOLE-E3-P2,251.113

And indeed I have sometimes admired to observe the impartiality and
judgement of children in placing one another according to their abilities
and parts, waving all other by-respects by <P_252> which men would be
inclined to set one higher, and another lower.  HOOLE-E3-P2,252.114

Yet if sometimes they seem to mistake in their judgement concerning a
boy , that is but newly come amongst them; or to be too partial against
any other upon some general splene, which is but very rare; The discreet
Master may after the election, correct the error by giving such a one a
place to his own liking, which he may keep till the next choyce, except
some of his inferiours have a list to dispute with him for his place,
HOOLE-E3-P2,252.115

and then he must put it to the hazard, having a lawful time given him
to provide before-hand for the contest.  HOOLE-E3-P2,252.116

3.  {COM:sic} HOOLE-E3-P2,252.117

Let all the Scholars take their places in the Schoole, according to
their several Formes, HOOLE-E3-P2,252.118

and let every one sit in his Form in that order in which he was elected.
HOOLE-E3-P2,252.119

It were good that the seates were so equally set on both sides the
Schoole, as that the higer side of each Form, might keep the higher side
of the School, I mean, that on the Masters right hand; and the lower
side of the Form, the lower side of the Schoole, which is that on the
Masters left hand.  HOOLE-E3-P2,252.120

However, let the upper side take alwayes the upper, and the lower,
the lower seats.  HOOLE-E3-P2,252.121

<P_253>

This placing of Scholars in an opposite manner, side against side, is
good in many respects, as, 1. To know on a suddain who is unruly
in, or absent out of his place.  2. To have them ready paired
at all times for Examinations, Disputations, or Orations, or the like.
3. To keep order in going in and out of their seats to say, or in
going home from Schoole, or the like.  4. To increase courage in
the Scholars, who are delighted to let their friends see, what place they
keep amongst the rest, when they come to visit them.  HOOLE-E3-P2,253.123

As they sit in their seats, be sure to keep them continually imployed ,
by proportioning every taske to the time and their strength, with respect
to the capacity of the weakest; HOOLE-E3-P2,253.124

for by this means, the strongest boyes will have more leisure to help,
and see the weakest can do their work, for which purpose they should
be appointed sometimes to sit in the middle amongst the rest, that they
may more readily be consulted with, & heard of all.  HOOLE-E3-P2,253.125

These should sometimes construe, and sometimes examine over their Lessons,
having their Grammars, <P_254> and Dictionaries, and other Subsidiary
books to help them, out of which they should appoint others to find what
they enquire after; HOOLE-E3-P2,254.126

and this will be so far from hindering their own progresse, that it
will encourage them to go faster onward, when they see how readily
they can lead the way, and incite their fellowes to follow after them.
HOOLE-E3-P2,254.127

When in getting Lessons, the whole Form shall be at a <font> Non-plus
<$$font>, let one of the leaders have recourse to the Master or Ushers, or
to whom they shall appoint him to go for resolution.  HOOLE-E3-P2,254.128

But I have found it a continual provoking of Scholars, to strive who
should learn the fastest, to let both the sides of one Form, as they sit
apart, so to look to provide their Lessons apart; and when they come
to say Parts or Lessons, or to perform Exercises, to bicker one with
another, and propound those things to be resolved in by their opposites,
which they observe the Master to have omitted, and they think they $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} tell.  HOOLE-E3-P2,254.129

And let it be constantly noted which side hath the better all the week,
that when afterwards they come to a general dispute at the weeks end,
for places or sides, it may be considered.  HOOLE-E3-P2,254.130

<P_255>

CHAP. V.  HOOLE-E3-P2,255.133

<font> Of saying Parts, and Lessons; and of perusing Translations,
and all other kind of Exercises.  <$$font> HOOLE-E3-P2,255.134

<$$heading>

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,255.136

The best time for saying <font> Grammar Parts <$$font>, or the like, is
the morning, partly because the memory is then the freshest; and partly,
because children may take the opportunity over night to get them perfectly
at home.  HOOLE-E3-P2,255.137

But forasmuch as <font> Vocabula's <$$font> are more easie to be
impressed in the mind, and require lesse paines in getting, I conceive
it not amisse, that children be continually exercised in saying
them for afternoons parts at one a clock, before which hour they may
prepare themselves afore-hand <paren> even <$$paren> amid their play.
HOOLE-E3-P2,255.138

After parts said, the Master or his Ushers should immediately give
Lessons to every Form, or appoint a boy out of an upper Form to give
Lessons to that which is next below him, in his hearing; which he should
distinctly construe <P_256> once or twice over, and note out all the
Words, wherein the most difficulty of parsing seems to lye, and name
the Tropes and Figures, the Phrases, and other elegancies that are to
be found especially in higher Authours.  HOOLE-E3-P2,256.139

The Lessons should be got ready to be said against ten a clock in the
forenoon, and four in the after noon; at which time the Scholars should
come all orderly and quietly out of their Form, and taking their places
where they ought to stand, <paren> so as one side may be opposite to
another <$$paren> they should all make their salutes, and then say one
after another, except they be appointed otherwise.  HOOLE-E3-P2,256.140

For sometimes when you have occasion to make more hastie dispatch with
a Form, you may cause any one or more to say the whole Lesson, or by
pieces; HOOLE-E3-P2,256.141

but be sure that they all come very well provided, and that every one be
intent upon what another is saying, for which purpose you may note him
that hath been most negligent in his seat, and ask him ever and anon,
what it was that his fellow said last.  HOOLE-E3-P2,256.142

To save your own lungs in asking many questions, and telling Rules,
or <P_257> the like, you may let every two boyes examine one another
, and your self onely help them, when they are both at a mistake.
HOOLE-E3-P2,257.143

You may easily amend that common and troublesome fault of indistinct and
muttering speaking, by calling out a bold spirited little boy, that can
speak with a grace; and encouraging him to give the other an higher note
for the elevation of his voyce: HOOLE-E3-P2,257.144

for this will at last enforce the boy you are troubled with, to speak
louder, and with a better grace; and to strive to pronounce his words
more distinctly, then the other did before him.  HOOLE-E3-P2,257.145

After Lessons are ended, you may let every one propound what questions
he pleaseth, for his opposite to answer, HOOLE-E3-P2,257.146

and this will be a means to whet them on to more diligence in getting
them, before they come to say.  HOOLE-E3-P2,257.147

In the three lowest Forms, or in others, where all have the same
Translations, or Dictates, you may cause onely him whose performance you
most doubt of, to read what he hath written both in English and Latine,
and help him, as you finde his errour, to correct it, and see that all
the rest amend their own <P_258> faults accordingly.  HOOLE-E3-P2,258.148

Afterwards, you may let one parse it both in English and Latine, and order
them all to write it over again fair in a Paper-book for themselves ,
and to give you also a copy of it neatly written in a loose paper,
every Saturday.  HOOLE-E3-P2,258.149

And thus you shall have every one begin to leane to his own strength, a
thing very necessary in all kinde of Exercises, though they doe the lesse.
HOOLE-E3-P2,258.150

If you once take notice of any boyes strength, you may easily judge
of what he bringeth, whether it be his own, or anothers doing.
HOOLE-E3-P2,258.151

But in the upper Formes, and where they have all several Exercises
, it is necessary that you peruse what every Scholar hath done.
HOOLE-E3-P2,258.152

And for this work, you may set apart Saturday fore-noons, after
Grammatical Examinations are ended, and before they say their Catechismes.
HOOLE-E3-P2,258.153

And that they may write them fair, you should sometimes compare
them with their Copy-Books, or such pieces as they writ last, at the
Writing-Schoole.  HOOLE-E3-P2,258.154

Before they bring them to you to read, let them peruse one anothers
Exercise amongst themselves, and try what faults they can finde in it;
HOOLE-E3-P2,258.155

and as you read them over, where you see a <P_259> grosse mistake,
explode it; HOOLE-E3-P2,259.156

where you espie any over-sight, note it with a dash, that they may amend
it; HOOLE-E3-P2,259.157

but where you see any fault, which is beyond their power to avoyd, or
remedy, do you mildely correct it for them, and advise them to observe
it for the future.  HOOLE-E3-P2,259.158

However, forget not to commend him most that hath done the best,
and for his encouragement to make him read over his exercise aloud,
that others may heare it, and then to hang it up in an eminent place,
that they may imitate it; HOOLE-E3-P2,259.159

and if any one can afterwards out-doe it, let his exercise be hanged up
in its stead.  HOOLE-E3-P2,259.160

But if any one hath lazily performed his exercise, so that it be worse
then all the rest, let it be cut in fashion of a leg, and be hanged up by
the heel, till he make a better, and deserve that that may be taken down.
HOOLE-E3-P2,259.161

It is not amisse also, to stirre them up to more diligence, to have a
<font> Common-paper-Book <$$font>, wherein the names of all in every
Form that have <font> optime <$$font> and <font> pessime <$$font>
performed their weekly exercises may be written, and that the one may
have the priviledge to beg a Play-day once a moneth, or to obtain pardon
for some of his fellows; and the other may be confined to some task,
when a Play-day is granted.  HOOLE-E3-P2,259.162

<P_260>

<heading>

CHAP. VI.  HOOLE-E3-P2,260.165

<font> Of weekly Repetitions: Of Grammaticall Examinations,
and Disputations.  Of collecting phrases, and gathering into
Common-place-Bookes.  Of pronouncing Orations, and Declamations.  <$$font>
HOOLE-E3-P2,260.166

<$$heading>

I have not in either of the foregoing Treatises made mention of any
thing to be done on Fridaies, because that day is commonly spent in most
Schooles, in repeating what hath been learned in the fore-going part of
the week; which custome, because it is a mean to $confirm {TEXT:confim}
childrens memories in what they learn, I willingly conform thereunto.
HOOLE-E3-P2,260.168

After Chapter's therefore read in a morning, let them repeat their wonted
Parts, and afterwards their Lessons, all which they will be able to say
together, out of their several Authours, so that some be made to repeat
out of one book, and some out of another.  HOOLE-E3-P2,260.169

For if due care be but had aforehand, that Scholars be very ready and
<P_261> perfect in their daily taskes, it will take away all toyle and
timerousnesse, which usually attends these Repetitions, and make that
this day will become the veryest play-day in all the week; when boyes
shall se that they have nothing to do, but what they can do already,
<paren> at least <$$paren> with a little looking of it over on Thursdaies
towards evening at home, HOOLE-E3-P2,261.170

what they have translated out of any Authour in Prose, should be read
out of English into Latine, HOOLE-E3-P2,261.171

and what they learn in Poets, should be said <paren> as well as can be
<$$paren> by heart, both for the verse and the matters sake, which will
furnish them with Authorities, and sharpen their invention for versifying.
HOOLE-E3-P2,261.172

After Repetitions ended, the Master should note all the Phrases and
Sentences, and other things observable in their Lessons, which they should
transcribe into <font> Phrase-bookes, and Common-place-Bookes <$$font>,
for their constant use in writing or speaking, or making Exercises,
as we have mentioned already before.  HOOLE-E3-P2,261.173

And because the most leisure is gained on Friday afternoones, it will
not be amisse about three a clock to let every Form to dispute side with
side , one <P_262> after another, after this manner.  HOOLE-E3-P2,262.174

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,262.175

Let every one propound to his opposite two or three questions, which
he thinks most difficult out of his weeks work, which if the other $can
$not {TEXT:cannot} answer readily before he count six, or ten in Latine,
let him be <font> Captus <$$font>, and the questions be propounded to
his next fellow.  HOOLE-E3-P2,262.176

The lowest in the Form may begin the dispute, and so go on to the highest
on either side, who should keep reckoning of those that are capt, and
how often.  HOOLE-E3-P2,262.177

2.  HOOLE-E3-P2,262.178

Besides their weeks works they may try, who can most perfectly repeat
<font> memoriter <$$font>, a part of their Grammar, or any Authour which
they read, or who can recite the most Vocabula's under one head, or who
can vary a phrase the best, or imitate any piece of an Oratour or Poet.
HOOLE-E3-P2,262.179

3.  HOOLE-E3-P2,262.180

Some time would also be spent in <font> Capping Latine verses <$$font>
amongst the lower Forms, and <font> Greek verses <$$font> amongst
the highest; for which they may provide themselves out of a <font>
Capping-book <$$font>, which seems to be made on purpose by <font>
Bartholomaeus Schonborn <$$font> or <font> Gnomologicon Poeticum <$$font>
, made lately by <font> Mr. Rosse <$$font>, besides which,
they may contrive a little Book of their own, wherein to write verses
Alphabetically <P_263> out of the best Poets.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.181

Let that side which appeareth to be the Victor have the upper seat in the
Schoole, till a new choice be made, except the other can win it from them
before, and bring them back with a hissing disgrace.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.182

Amid these disputes, the Master must have a great care to suppresse
noise and tumultuous clamour, and see that no boy stirre out of his
appointed place.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.183

For they are apt to heighten their spirits beyond moderation, if the
Masters discretion doe not settle them.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.184

Let it be now lawful for any lower boy in a Form, to dispute with one
above him for his place.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.185

Mr. <font> Stockwoods <$$font> Disputations will be helpfull to
the upper Scholars.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.186

Now, that all your Scholars may be thorowly grounded in their Grammar,
so as not to be apt to forget what they have learnt in it; let them all
be exercised in the examination of a part of it every Saturday morning
thus; HOOLE-E3-P2,263.187

1.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.188

Let the first and lowest Form examine the two next above them out of
the examination of the Accidents, asking them the Questions as they are
in the Book, and causing them to answer without book, and according to
the Accidents.  HOOLE-E3-P2,263.189

<P_264>

2.  HOOLE-E3-P2,264.191

Then let all those three Forms run over the Examples of the Declensions
and Conjugations, as I formerly shewed, & try, who can pusle one another
in declining any hard Noun, or Conjugating and Forming any Verb ,
and give the Rule of the Genders of the one, or Preterperfect tense,
or Supin of the other; HOOLE-E3-P2,264.192

when these have done, 3. Let the fourth Form examine the two
highest Forms in <font> Examinatio Latinae Grammaticae <$$font>, and
sometimes in <font> Elementa Rhetorica <$$font>, HOOLE-E3-P2,264.193

and then 4. Let all these three Forms run over the Paradigmes of
the Greek Declensions and Conjugations.  HOOLE-E3-P2,264.194

5.  HOOLE-E3-P2,264.195

Afterwards the two upper Forms may bicker with one another touching
Grammar niceties, either Latine or Greek, which they have taken notice of,
and collected into a <font> Common-place-book <$$font>, as I mentioned
before.  HOOLE-E3-P2,264.196

But a principal care must be had to bring all your Scholars to an habit
of speaking Latine, HOOLE-E3-P2,264.197

and therefore a strict Law should be made and observed, that every
Scholar <paren> especially after he hath been one quarter of a year at
Schoole <$$paren> should either learn to speak in Latine, or be enforced
to hold his tongue.  HOOLE-E3-P2,264.198

And to help the little ones in so doing, besides those <font> Phrasiuncula
<$$font> at the end of <font> the <P_265> Grounds of Grammar <$$font>,
they should have <font> Formulae loquendi quotidianae <$$font> , such
expressions as are every day used <paren> especially about the Schoole
<$$paren> writ down in a little book, that they may get them by heart
at by-times.  HOOLE-E3-P2,265.199

As for the other boyes, they will be better guided how to speak by the
Rules of Grammar, and the constant use and imitation of approved Authours.
HOOLE-E3-P2,265.200

I conceive, the penury of proper words and good phrase, with many
Teachers, is a main reason why children are not as well trained up to
speak Latine in <font> England <$$font>, as they are in many places
beyond Seas, HOOLE-E3-P2,265.201

and the ready & frequent use of their Mother-tongue causeth, that
they are hardly reclaimed from it to make use of another Language.
Whereas, if whilest they are at the Schoole, they might hear little or no
English spoken, nor be suffered to speak it, they would quickly conforme
themselves to discourse in Latine.  As I have known French boyes that
understood not a word in English, to be able in two or three moneths to
talk it as readily, as they that were English borne.  HOOLE-E3-P2,265.202

Onely at the first, one must wink at their improprieties, and harshnesse
in pronunciation of some words and phrases, and take their meaning by
what they speak, HOOLE-E3-P2,265.203

<P_266>

and after a while by custome and imitation of others, they will speak
in Latine, as properly as the best; especially after they have gained
the knowledge of Grammar, accustomed themselves to observe the style of
Latine Authours.  HOOLE-E3-P2,266.205

No day in the week should passe on which some Declamation, Oration, or
Theme should not be pronounced, about a quarter of an hour before the
Schoole be broken up, and after Lessons are all ended in the forenoon.
That by assiduity in these exercises, the Scholars may be emboldened to
perform them with a grace before whomsoever, and upon occasion of any
solemnity, or coming of Friends into the Schoole.  HOOLE-E3-P2,266.206

There should be two standing desks set opposite in the midst of the
Schoole, for boyes to stand at, when they pronounce.  HOOLE-E3-P2,266.207
