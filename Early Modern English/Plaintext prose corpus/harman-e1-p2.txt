I lately had standinge in my well house, which standeth on the backeside
of my house, a great cawdron of copper, beinge then full of water,
hauinge in the same halfe a doson <P_35> of pewter dyshes, well marked
, and stamped with the connizance of my armes, whiche being well noted
when they were taken out, were set a side, the water powred out, and my
caudron taken awaye, being of such bygnes that one man, vnlesse he were
of great strength, was not able far to cary the same.  HARMAN-E1-P2,35.2

Not withstandinge, the same was one night within this two yeares conuayed
more then half a myle from my house, into a commen or heth, And ther
bestowed in a great fir-bushe.  HARMAN-E1-P2,35.3

I then immediatly the next day sent one of my men to London,
HARMAN-E1-P2,35.4

and there gaue warning in Sothwarke, kent strete, and Barmesey streete,
to all the Tynckars there dwelling, - That if any such Caudron came
thether to be sold, the bringar therof should be stayed, HARMAN-E1-P2,35.5

and promised twenty shyllings for a reward.  HARMAN-E1-P2,35.6

I gaue also intelligence to the water men that kept the ferres, that no
such vessel should be ether conuayd to London or into essex, promysing
the lyke reward, to haue vnderstanding therof.  HARMAN-E1-P2,35.7

This my doing was well vnderstand in many places about, HARMAN-E1-P2,35.8

and that the feare of espyinge so troubled the conscience of the stealer,
that my caudoren laye vntouched in the thicke firbushe more then halfe
a yeare after, which, by a great chaunce, was found by hunteres for
conneys; HARMAN-E1-P2,35.9

for one chaunced to runne into the same bushe where my caudren was,
HARMAN-E1-P2,35.10

and being perceaued, one thrust his staffe into the same bushe,
HARMAN-E1-P2,35.11

and hyt my caudren a great blowe, the sound whereof dyd cause the man
to thinke and hope that there was some great treasure hidden, wherby he
thought to be the better whyle he lyued.  HARMAN-E1-P2,35.12

And in farther searching he found my caudren; HARMAN-E1-P2,35.13

so had I the same agayne vnloked for.  HARMAN-E1-P2,35.14

these when they practise there pylfringe, it is all by night;
HARMAN-E1-P2,35.22

for, as they walke a day times from house to house, to demaund charitie ,
they vigelantly marke where or in what place they maye attayne to there

HARMAN-E1-P2,35.23

and that wyll they <P_36> be sure to haue the next night folowing;
HARMAN-E1-P2,36.24

for they customably carry with them a staffe of v. or vi.
foote long, in which, within one ynch of the tope therof, ys a lytle hole
bored through, in which hole they putte an yron hoke, HARMAN-E1-P2,36.25

and with the same they wyll pluck vnto them quickly any thing that they

such haue I sene at my house, HARMAN-E1-P2,36.27

and haue handled ther staues, not then vnderstanding to what vse or

they wyl ether leane vppon there staffe, to hyde the hole thereof

I was credebly informed that a hoker came to a farmers house in the ded

and will walke through grounds and pastures, to search and se horses

And if thei chaunce to be met and asked by the owners of the grounde

These will also repayre to gentlemens houses and aske their charitye,

And if you aske them what they can do, they wyll saye that they can kepe

These haue also their women, that walkinge from them in other places,

And loke, where they steale any thinge, they conuay <font> the <$$font>

There was a Gentleman, a verye friende of myne, rydyng from London
homewarde into Kente, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.58

hauinge with in three myles of his house busynesse, alyghted of his
horse, and his man also, in a pretye vyllage, where diueres houses were,
HARMAN-E1-P2,43.59

and looked aboute hym where he myghte haue a conuenient person to walke
his horse, beecause hee would speake with a Farmer that dwelt on the
backe side of the sayde village, lytle aboue a quarter of a myle from
the place where he lighted, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.60

and had his man to waight vpon him, as it was mete for his callinge:
HARMAN-E1-P2,43.61

espying a Pryggar there standing, thinking the same to dwell there,
charging this prity prigginge person to walke his horse well, and that
they might not stande styll for takyng of colde, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.62

and at his returne <paren> which he saide should not be longe <$$paren>
he would geue hym a peny to drinke, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.63

and so wente aboute his busines.  HARMAN-E1-P2,43.64

This peltynge Priggar, proude of his praye, walkethe his horse vp and
downe tyll he sawe the Gentleman out of sighte, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.65

and leapes him into the saddell, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.66

and awaye he goeth a mayne.  HARMAN-E1-P2,43.67

This Gentleman returninge, and findinge not his horses, sent his man to
the one end of the vyllage, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.68

and he went himselfe vnto the other ende, HARMAN-E1-P2,43.69

and enquired as he went for his horses that were walked,
HARMAN-E1-P2,43.70

and began some what to suspecte, because neither he nor his man could
se nor find him.  HARMAN-E1-P2,43.71

Then this Gentleman deligentlye enquired of thre or foure towne dwellers
there whether any such person, declaring his stature, age, apparell,
with so many linamants of his body as he could call to remembraunce.
HARMAN-E1-P2,43.72

And,"vna voce,"all sayde that no such man dwelt in their streate,
neither in the parish, that they knewe of; HARMAN-E1-P2,43.73

but some did wel remember that such a one they saw there lyrkinge and
huggeringe <P_44> two houses before the Gentleman came thether, and a

"I had thoughte,"quoth this Gentleman,"he had here dwelled, "-
HARMAN-E1-P2,44.75

And out they goe, in a fustian fume, into the backe syde, where was a

and there fell to pitching of the barre, being thre to thre.
HARMAN-E1-P2,46.131

The Moone dyd shine bright, HARMAN-E1-P2,46.132

At the laste they coulde not agree vpon a caste, HARMAN-E1-P2,46.134

Then the noyse increased; HARMAN-E1-P2,46.138

the Counstable woulde haue had them to the stockes.  HARMAN-E1-P2,46.139

The wyfe of the house runnes out with her goodman to intreat the

and leaues the Pyg at the fyre alone.  HARMAN-E1-P2,46.141

In commeth two or three of the next neighboures, beinge waked wyth this

and carieth the same awaye wyth them, spyte and all, with suche breade

When the goodman and the goodwyfe of the house hadde intreated and
pacified the Counstable, shewinge vnto him that they were Proctors
and Factores all of Spyttell houses, and that they taryed there but to
breake theyr fast, and woulde ryde awaye immediatelye after, for they had
farre to goe, and therefore mente to ryde so earlye.  And comminge into
their house agayne, fyndinge the Pygge wyth bread and drincke all gonne,
made a greate exclamation, HARMAN-E1-P2,46.146

for they knewe not who had the same.  HARMAN-E1-P2,46.147

The Counstable returning and hearinge the lamentable wordes of the good

suche men of worshyppe, at the leaste foure or fiue, as dwelleth neare
or next to the place where they fayne their landinge.  HARMAN-E1-P2,48.196

And neare to those shieres wyll they not begge, vntyll they come into
Wylshyre, Hamshyre, Barkeshyre, Oxfordshyre, Harfordshyre, Middelsex ,
and so to London, and downe by the ryuer to seeke for their shyppe and
goods that they neuer hade: HARMAN-E1-P2,48.197

then passe they through Surrey, Sossex, by the sea coasts, and so
into Kent, demaunding almes to bring them home to their country.
HARMAN-E1-P2,48.198

Some tyme they counterfet the seale of the Admiraltie.
HARMAN-E1-P2,48.199

I haue diuers tymes taken a waye from them their lycences, of both sortes,
wyth suche money as they haue gathered, HARMAN-E1-P2,48.200

and haue confiscated the same to the pouerty nigh adioyninge to me.
HARMAN-E1-P2,48.201

And they wyll not <P_49> beelonge with out another.  HARMAN-E1-P2,49.202

For at anye good towne they wyll renewe the same.  HARMAN-E1-P2,49.203

Once wyth muche threatninge and faire promises, I required to knowe of
one {the} companye who made their lycence.  HARMAN-E1-P2,49.204

And they sweare that they bought the same at Portsmouth, of a Mariner
there, and it cost them two shillinges; with such warrantes to be so
good and efectuall, that if any of the best men of lawe, or learned,
aboute London, should peruse the same, they weare able to fynde no faute
there with, but would assuredly allow the same.  HARMAN-E1-P2,49.205

A COUNTERFET CRANKE.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.210

CAP. 11.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.211

<$$heading>

These that do counterfet the Cranke be yong knaves and yonge harlots,
that depely dissemble the falling sicknes.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.213

For the Cranke in their language is the falling euyll.
HARMAN-E1-P2,51.214

I haue seene some of these with fayre writinges testimoniall, with the
names and seales of some men of worshyp in Shropshyre, and in other
Shieres farre of, that I haue well knowne, HARMAN-E1-P2,51.215

and haue taken the same from them.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.216

Many of these do go without writinges, HARMAN-E1-P2,51.217

and wyll go halfe naked, and looke most pitiously.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.218

And if any clothes be geuen them, $they imnmediatly sell the same,
HARMAN-E1-P2,51.219

for weare it they wyll not, because they would bee the more pitied,
HARMAN-E1-P2,51.220

and weare fylthy clothes on their heades, HARMAN-E1-P2,51.221

and neuer go without a peece of whyte sope about them, which, if they
see cause or present gaine, they wyll priuely conuey the same into their
mouth, and so worke the same there, that they wyll fome as it were a
Boore, <font> and <$$font> maruelously for a tyme torment them selves;
HARMAN-E1-P2,51.222

and thus deceiue they the common people, HARMAN-E1-P2,51.223

and gayne much.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.224

These haue commonly their harlots as the other.  HARMAN-E1-P2,51.225

Apon Alhollenday in the morning last Anno domini.  1566, or my booke
was halfe printed, I meane the first impression, there came earely in
the morninge a Counterfet Cranke vnder my lodgynge at the whyte Fryares,
wythin the cloyster, in a lyttle yard or coorte, where aboutes laye two
or thre great Ladyes, being without the lyberties of London, where by
he hoped for the greatter gayne; HARMAN-E1-P2,51.226

this Cranke there lamentably lamentinge and pitefully crying to be
releued, declared to dyuers their hys paynfull and miserable dysease.
HARMAN-E1-P2,51.227

I being rysen and not halfe ready, harde his dolfull wordes and rufull
mornings, HARMAN-E1-P2,51.228

hering him name the falling sicknes, thought assuredlye to my selfe that
hee was a depe desemblar; HARMAN-E1-P2,51.229

so, comminge out at a sodayne, and beholdinge his vgly and yrksonle
attyre, hys lothsome and horyble countinance, it made me in a meruelous
parplexite what to thinke of hym, whether it were fayned or trouth,
- HARMAN-E1-P2,51.230

for after this manner went he: HARMAN-E1-P2,51.231

he was naked from the wast vpward, sauyng he had a old Ierken of leather
patched, HARMAN-E1-P2,51.232

and that was lose about hym, that all his bodye laye out bare;
HARMAN-E1-P2,51.233

a filthy foule cloth he ware on his head, <P_52> being cut for the
purpose, hauing a narowe place to put out his face, with a bauer made to
trusse vp his beard, and a stryng that tyed the same downe close aboute
his necke; with an olde felt hat which he styll caried in his hande to
reccaue the charytye and deuotion of the people, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.234

for that woulde he hold out from hym; HARMAN-E1-P2,52.235

hauyng hys face, from the eyes downe ward, all smerd with freshe bloud ,
as thoughe he had new falen, and byn tormented wyth his paynefull panges,
- his Ierken beinge all be rayde with durte and myre, and hys hatte and
hosen also, as thoughe hee hadde wallowed in the myre: HARMAN-E1-P2,52.236

sewerly the sighte was monstrous and terreble.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.237

I called hym vnto me, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.238

and demaunded of hym what he ayled.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.239

"A, good maister,"quoth he,"I haue the greuous and paynefull dyseas
called the falynge syckenes. "HARMAN-E1-P2,52.240

"Why,"quoth I,"howe commeth thy Ierken, hose, and hat so be rayd with
durte and myre, and thy skyn also? "HARMAN-E1-P2,52.241

"A, good master, I fell downe on the backesyde here in the fowle lane
harde by the watersyde; HARMAN-E1-P2,52.242

and there I laye all most all night, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.243

and haue bled all most all the bloude owte in my bodye. "
HARMAN-E1-P2,52.244

It raynde that morninge very fast; HARMAN-E1-P2,52.245

and whyle I was thus talkinge with hym, an honest poore woman that dwelt
thereby brought hym a fayre lynnen cloth, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.246

and byd hym wype his face therewyth; HARMAN-E1-P2,52.247

and there beinge a tobbe standing full of rayne water, offered to geue hym
some in a dishe that he might make hym selfe cleane: HARMAN-E1-P2,52.248

hee refuseth the same.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.249

"Why dost thou so? "quoth I.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.250

"A, syr,"sayth he,"yf I shoulde washe my selfe, I shoulde fall to
bleedinge a freshe againe, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.251

and then I should not stop my selfe:"HARMAN-E1-P2,52.252

these wordes made me the more to suspecte hym.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.253

Then I asked of hym where he was borne, what is {COM:sic} name was, how
longe he had this dysease, and what tyme he had ben here about London,
and in what place.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.254

"Syr,"saythe he,"I was borne at Leycestar, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.255

my name is Nycholas Genings, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.256

and I haue had this falling sycknes viij. yeares,
HARMAN-E1-P2,52.257

and I can get no remedy for the same; HARMAN-E1-P2,52.258

for I haue it by kinde, HARMAN-E1-P2,52.259

my father had it and my friendes before me; HARMAN-E1-P2,52.260

and I haue byne these two yeares here about London, and a yeare and a
halfe in bethelem. "HARMAN-E1-P2,52.261

"Why, wast thou out of thy wyttes? "quoth I.  HARMAN-E1-P2,52.262

"Ye, syr, that I was. "HARMAN-E1-P2,52.263

<P_53>

"What is the Kepars name of the house? "HARMAN-E1-P2,53.265

"Hys name is,"quoth hee,"Iohn Smith. "HARMAN-E1-P2,53.266

"Then,"quoth I,"hee must vnderstande of thy dysease; HARMAN-E1-P2,53.267

yf thou hadest the same for the tyme thou wast there, he knoweth it
well. "HARMAN-E1-P2,53.268

"Ye, not onely he, but all the house bee syde,"quoth this Cranke;
HARMAN-E1-P2,53.269

"for I came thens but within this fortnight. "HARMAN-E1-P2,53.270

I had stande so longe reasoning the matter wyth him that I was a cold,
HARMAN-E1-P2,53.271

and went into my chamber HARMAN-E1-P2,53.272

and made me ready, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.273

and commaunded my seruant to repayre to bethelem, and bringe me true
worde from the keper there whether anye suche man hath byn with him as
a prisoner hauinge the dysease aforesayd, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.274

and gaue hym a note of his name and the kepars also: HARMAN-E1-P2,53.275

my seruant, retorninge to my lodginge, dyd assure me that neither was
there euer anye such man there, nether yet anye keper of any suche name
; HARMAN-E1-P2,53.276

but hee that was there keper, he sent me hys name in writing, afferming
that hee letteth no man depart from hym vnlesse he be fet a waye by hys
freendes, and that none that came from hym beggeth aboute the Citye.
HARMAN-E1-P2,53.277

Then I sent for the Printar of this booke, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.278

and shewed hym of this dyssembling Cranke, and how I had sent to Bethelem
to vnderstand the trouth, and what aunswere I receaued againe , requiringe
hym that I might haue some seruant of his to watche him faithfully that
daye, that I might vnderstand trustely to what place he woulde repaire
at night vnto, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.279

and thether I promised to goe my selfe to see their order, and that I
woulde haue hym to associate me thether: HARMAN-E1-P2,53.280

hee gladly graunted to my request, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.281

and sent two boyes, that both diligently and vygelantly accomplisht the
charge geuen them, and found the same Cranke aboute the Temple, where
about xii. of the clocke he wente on the backesyde of Clementes
Ine without Temple barre: HARMAN-E1-P2,53.282

there is a lane that goeth into the Feldes; HARMAN-E1-P2,53.283

there hee renewed his face againe wyth freshe bloud, which he caried
about hym in a bladder, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.284

and dawbed on freshe dyrte vpon his Ierken, hat, and hoson.
HARMAN-E1-P2,53.285

And so came backe agayne vnto the Temple, and sometyme to the Watersyde
, HARMAN-E1-P2,53.286

and begged of all that passed bye: HARMAN-E1-P2,53.287

the boyes behelde howe some gaue grotes, some syxe pens, some gaue more;
HARMAN-E1-P2,53.288

<P_54>

for hee looked so ougleie and yrksomlye, that euerye one pytied his
miserable case that beehelde hym.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.290

To bee shorte, there he passed all the daye tyll night approched;
HARMAN-E1-P2,54.291

and when it began to bee some what dark, he went to the water syde
HARMAN-E1-P2,54.292

and toke a Skoller, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.293

and was sette ouer the Water into Saincte Georges feldes, contrarye to
my expectatian; HARMAN-E1-P2,54.294

for I had thought he woulde haue gonne into Holborne or to Saynt Gylles
in the felde; HARMAN-E1-P2,54.295

but these boyes, with Argues and Lynces eyes, set sewre watche vppon him,
HARMAN-E1-P2,54.296

and the one tooke a bote HARMAN-E1-P2,54.297

and followed him, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.298

and the other went backe to tell his maister.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.299

The boye that so folowed hym by Water, had no money to pay for his Bote
hyre, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.300

but layde his Penner and his Ynkhorne to gage for a penny;
HARMAN-E1-P2,54.301

and by that tyme the boye was sette ouer, his Maister, wyth all celeryte ,
hadde taken a Bote HARMAN-E1-P2,54.302

and followed hym apase: HARMAN-E1-P2,54.303

now hadde they styll a syght of the Cranke, wych crossed ouer the felddes
towardes Newyngton, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.304

and thether he went, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.305

and by that tyme they came thether it was very darke: HARMAN-E1-P2,54.306

the Prynter hadde there no acquaintance, nether any kynde of weapon
about hym, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.307

nether knewe he how farre the Cranke woulde goe, becawse hee then
suspected that they dogged hym of purposse; HARMAN-E1-P2,54.308

he there stayed hym, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.309

and called for the Counstable, whyche came forthe dylygentelye to inquyre
what the matter was: HARMAN-E1-P2,54.310

thys zelous Pryntar charged thys offycer wyth hym as a malefactor and
a dessemblinge vagabonde - HARMAN-E1-P2,54.311

the Counstable woulde haue layde him all night in the Cage that stode
in the streate.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.312

"Naye,"saythe this pitifull Prynter,"I praye you haue him into your
house; HARMAN-E1-P2,54.313

for this is lyke to be a cold nyght, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.314

and he is naked: HARMAN-E1-P2,54.315

you kepe a vytellinge house; HARMAN-E1-P2,54.316

let him be well cherished this night, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.317

for he is well hable to paye for the same.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.318

I knowe well his gaynes hath byn great to day, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.319

and your house is a sufficient pryson for the tyme, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.320

and we wil there serche hym.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.321

The Counstable agreed there vnto: HARMAN-E1-P2,54.322

they had him in, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.323

and caused him to washe him selfe: HARMAN-E1-P2,54.324

that donne, they demaunded what money he had about hym.
HARMAN-E1-P2,54.325

Sayth this Cranke,"So God helpe me, I haue but xii. pence,
"HARMAN-E1-P2,54.326

and plucked oute the same of a lytle pursse.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.327

"Why, haue you no more? "quoth they.  HARMAN-E1-P2,54.328

"No,"sayth this Cranke,"as God shall saue my soule at the day of
iudgement. "HARMAN-E1-P2,54.329

"We must se more,"quoth they, HARMAN-E1-P2,54.330

<P_55>

and began to stryp hym.  HARMAN-E1-P2,55.332

Then he plucked out a nother purse, wherin was xl. pens.
HARMAN-E1-P2,55.333

"Toushe,"sayth thys Prynter,"I must see more. " HARMAN-E1-P2,55.334

Saythe this Cranke,"I pray God I bee dampned both body and soule yf I
haue anye more. "HARMAN-E1-P2,55.335

"No,"sayth thys Prynter,"thou false knaue, here is my boye that dyd watche
thee all this daye, and sawe when such men gaue the peeses of sixe pens,
grotes, and other money; HARMAN-E1-P2,55.336

and yet thou hast shewed vs none but small money. "HARMAN-E1-P2,55.337

When thys Cranke hard this, and the boye vowinge it to his face, he
relented, HARMAN-E1-P2,55.338

and plucked out another pursse, where in was eyght shyllings and od
money; HARMAN-E1-P2,55.339

so had they in the hole that he had begged that day xiij. shillings
iii. pens halfepeny.  HARMAN-E1-P2,55.340

Then they strypt him starke naked, HARMAN-E1-P2,55.341

and as many as sawe him sayd they neuer sawe hansommer man, wyth a
yellowe flexen beard, and fayre skynned, withoute anye spot or greffe.
HARMAN-E1-P2,55.342

Then the good wyfe of the house fet her goodmans olde clocke,
HARMAN-E1-P2,55.343

and caused the same to be cast about him, because the sight shoulde
not abash her shamefast maydens, nether loth her squaymysh sight.
HARMAN-E1-P2,55.344

Thus he set downe at the Chemnes end, HARMAN-E1-P2,55.345

and called for a potte of Beere, HARMAN-E1-P2,55.346

and dranke of a quarte at a draft, HARMAN-E1-P2,55.347

and called for another, and so the thyrde, that one had bene sufficient
for any resonable man, the Drynke was so stronge.  HARMAN-E1-P2,55.348

I my selfe, the next morninge, tasted thereof; HARMAN-E1-P2,55.349

but let the reader iudge what and howe much he would haue dronke and he
had bene out of feare.  HARMAN-E1-P2,55.350

Then when they had thus wrong water out of a flint in spoyling him of his
euyl gotten goods, his passing pens, <font> and <$$font> fleting trashe,
The printer with this offecer were in gealy gealowsit, HARMAN-E1-P2,55.351

and deuised to search a barne for some roges and vpright men, a
quarter of a myle from the house, that stode a lone in the fieldes,
HARMAN-E1-P2,55.352

and wente out about their busines, leauing this cranke alone with his
wyfe and maydens: HARMAN-E1-P2,55.353

this crafty Cranke, espying al gon, requested <font> the <$$font> good
wife that hee might goe out on the backesyde to make water, and to
exonerate his paunche: HARMAN-E1-P2,55.354

she bad hym drawe the lache of the dore and goe out, neither thinkinge
or mistrusting he <P_56> would haue gon awaye naked; HARMAN-E1-P2,56.355

but, to conclude, when hee was out, he cast awaye the cloke,
HARMAN-E1-P2,56.356

and, as naked as euer he was borne, he ran away, that he could neuer be
hard of againe.  HARMAN-E1-P2,56.357

Now the next morning betimes, I went vnto Newington, to vnderstand what
was done, because I had word or it was day that there my printer was;
HARMAN-E1-P2,56.358

and at my comming thether, I hard the hole circumstaunce, as I above
haue wrytten; HARMAN-E1-P2,56.359

and I, seing the matter so fall out, tooke order with the chiefe of the
parish that this xiij. shyllings <font> and <$$font> iij.
pens halfpeny might the next daye be equally distributed, by their good
discrecions, to the pouertie of the same parishe, HARMAN-E1-P2,56.360

and so it was done.  HARMAN-E1-P2,56.361
