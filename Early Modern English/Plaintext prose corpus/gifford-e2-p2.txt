<P_F1V>

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I doe not see how any man can indeed iustifie, or
maintaine, that the spirites which appeare vnto them in the Christall ,
or in the glasse, or water, or that any way do speake, and shewe matters
vnto them, be holy Angels, or the soules of excellent men, as of Moses,
Samuel, Dauid, and others, though I haue heard that the cunning men,
take them to be such, and thinke they deale by them against deuils.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.2

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is no matter what Satans vassals are made
to beleeue by his subtil sleights: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.3

it is most abhominable for any Christian man, euer to let it enter into
his thought, that they doe any thing by the power or wisdome of the holie
Ghost, by any Angel or good spirit, or that they doe any thing against
the deuill, which worke by the intelligence which they haue from euill
spirits: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.4

therfore hold this, that they seeke vnto deuils, which run vnto those
southsayers.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.5

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I am perswaded indeed that they seek vnto deuils,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.6

but I would see some reason for it out of Gods word.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.7

<font> Dan. <$$font> Touching all spirituall matters, as to be
armed with power against deuils, and to know how to auoid the daungers
which they bring, we are no where to seeke, and to learne but of our
most blessed Lorde God.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F1V.8

And of <P_F2R> him we $can $not {TEXT:cannot} learn, but by his holy
word, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.9

for in it he hath opened vnto vs all his whole will.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.10

And therefore, where the Lorde commaundeth the people of Israel by
Moses, <font> Deut. 18 <$$font> that they should not when they
came into the land, learn to do according to the abhominations of those
heathen, reckoning vp sundry kinds of such as were Satans instruments
which he vsed to seduce the multitude, by deuinations, by obseruing of
times, by augurie, by iuglings with the helpe of the deuill, by vsing
familiar Spirits, spirits of deuination, and seeking to the dead:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.11

he setteth downe also the remedie, shewing first, that he woulde cast out
those nations because they harkened vnto the southsayers, and deuiners,
pronouncing that euerie one which doth those things, is an abhomination
to the Lorde, willing his people that they should not harken to such,
but that they should hearken vnto him: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.12

And then Moses saith, <font> A Prophet shall the Lord thy God
raise vp vnto thee from among you of thy brethren like vnto me,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.13

him shal ye heare.  <$$font> GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.14

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Then you prooue by that place, that we muste
seeke only to God, and not to such as work by meanes besides his words.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.15

<font> Dan. <$$font> If you read that place, <font> Deut.
18 <$$font> and mark euery thinge well, you shall see it doeth not onely
prooue that they seeke vnto Deuilles, which runne to these cunning men
and women: because the Prophetes which God hath raysed vp to declare
the Lords will, commaund vs not to doe such things: but also declareth
that they bee an abhomination to the Lorde that vse them, or that seeke
vnto them.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.16

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I see then it is not onelie a sinne, but a moste
horrible sinne, to seeke vnto them.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.17

Alas, many do not think that they seeke vnto deuilles, when they goe for
helpe vnto them for thinges stollen, or for helpe and remedie against
witches.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2R.18

<P_F2V>

<font> Dan. <$$font> No doubt many refuse to hear the voyce of God,
to be instructed by him: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.20

they despise his word, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.21

and therfore they be giuen vp to hearken vnto Deuilles.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.22

Such as haue sought vnto any of these that worke by the deuill, and
now come to see their offence, ought to shew repentaunce for the same,
not as for a light sinne.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.23

It is no small abhomination to goe for helpe vnto the deuill:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.24

It is to set him in Gods place, and to honour him as God.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.25

It riseth of infidelity and distrust of help from God, as we may see in
the example of king Saule, who finding no answere nor comforte from God,
whom he had so wickedly disobeyed, went to a witch.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.26

The heathen man saide, <font> Flectere si nequeo Superos, Acheronta
mouebo.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.27

If I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} intreat the goddes, I will downe among
the deuils.  <$$font> GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.28

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Nay, doubtles there can be no defence made for
such seeking help at their hands, which deale with familiar spirits,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.29

but I muse at diuers thinges, as this for one, how the cunning men, if
they deale by the power of the deuill, should vse such good wordes, and
will them that come vnto them to doe all in the name of Christ, teaching
them to vse words and sentences of the scriptures.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.30

<font> Dan. <$$font> O sir, here lieth the deep subtiltie of
Satan, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.31

how should the people be seduced to follow him, if he should not vse great
cunning to couer matters, as if deuils were driuen out, and harmes cured
that are done by them, euen through the name and mightie power of God.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.32

Herein also lyeth a more foule abhomination, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.33

and that is the abusing and horrible prophaning of the most blessed
name of God, and the holie Scriptures vnto witcheries, charmes, and
coniurations, and vnto all deuillish artes.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.34

Such an one is haunted with a fayrie, or a spirit: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.35

he must learne a charme compounded of some straunge speaches, and the
names of God intermingled, or weare some part of S. Johns Gospeall
or such like.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.36

So against the thiefe, against the deuill sent by the witch, $the $like
{COM:sic} is practized.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F2V.37

What can Satan <P_F3R> desire more, than {he_desires} that holie thinges
should be thus abused?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.38

There is adoe to get him into the glasse, to get him into the Chrystall,
to get him into the basen of water: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.39

there is a doe to binde hym, as it were by the name & power of Christ
to tell this thing or that thing.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.40

The coniurer hee bindeth him with the name of God, and by the vertue of
Christes passion and resurrection, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.41

& so maketh him serue his turne: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.42

And all is his owne worke, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.43

for he is not constrayned, nor bound, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.44

but seeketh thus to haue God blasphemed.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.45

O <paren> sayth the simple man <$$paren> this is a good woman,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.46

shee speaketh of God, and of Christ, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.47

and doth all in his name: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.48

they be good words which she hath taught me to vse: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.49

and what hurt can there be in vsing good wordes?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.50

Alas poore man, what case are they in which must learne good words of
the deuill?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.51

It is not the speaking of good wordes, or the wearing some part of the
scriptures, that defendeth from deuils, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.52

therein lieth the craft of satan, to haue those holy thinges so foullie
abused, and that men may put trust in wordes and sentences pronounced,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.53

but the deuilles are withstood onlie by the power of faith, where the
holie scriptures are written in the heart, & the soule armed with the
power of them.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.54

From this Satan draweth men by his soothsayers, teaching them other
helpes: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.55

For the naming of God, or the sentences of scripture bindeth not satan,
when we reade he can vtter them.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.56

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Then howe can the deuill beare such a pitifull
minde, as to help those that bee in misery?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.57

For many haue helpe by these cunning men.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.58

The deuill is cruell and bent wholly to hurt, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.59

and that is it which perswadeth manie that things are done euen by the
power of God.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.60

<font> Dan. <$$font> The deuils be as pitifull as a greedy hungrie
lion that roareth after his pray, and as a fierce Dragon, all burning
with wrath and bloody malice: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3R.61

they make shew of doing good vnto men, only of a most cruel and murtherous
purpose, euen to draw men deeper into the pit of hell with <P_F3V> them.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.62

For if they can help the bodie a litle, it is to win both bodie and
soule vnto eternall damnation.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.63

Where satan offereth his help, it is more to be feared, than
where he manifestly impugneth, and seeketh apparantly to hurt.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.64

<font> M.B.  <$$font> But this then is more strange, if they doe not
deale by the power of God, but by the power of the deuill, when they
driue out deuils from hurting, howe one deuill should driue out another.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.65

Our sauiour saith, that satan doth not driue out satan,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.66

for then his kingdom should bee deuided GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.67

and could not stand.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.68

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is most certaine that satan doth not
driue out satan: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.69

for our sauiour shewed the reason of the contrarie.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.70

One deuill is readie to further the worke of another: but in no wise to
expel or to hinder one another.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.71

<font> M.B.  <$$font> There is it which maketh me to muse:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.72

we see the deuill driuen out, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.73

and doeth not returne againe, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.74

and if it not be wrought by the power of deuilles, as you say, it
$can $not {TEXT:cannot}, then must it needs be by the power of God,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.75

<font> Dan. <$$font> The Deuill is driuen out, neither by the
power of the deuill, nor yet by the power of God, in these that are
healed by cunning men.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.76

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I like this worst of al the speach which I heard
you vtter yet: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.77

for if satan be not driuen out neither by the power of satan, nor
by the power of God, what other power is there to driue him out?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.78

If you can shewe a third power to expell him, it is more than euer I
heard of.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.79

<font> Dan. <$$font> There needeth not a thirde power to expell
him, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.80

for he is not driuen out at all.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.81

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I told you before, if you deni that to be, which
all experience doth shewe, then is it no reasoning.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.82

There be examples in many places, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.83

and daylie it is seene, that the deuill is driuen out of some possessed
, that wher he did vexe and torment men in their bodies, and in their
cattle, they haue remedie against him.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F3V.84

<font> Dan. <$$font> I doe not denie but that some which
are possessed <P_F4R> and tormented by Satan, haue release:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.85

but yet the deuill is not cast foorth by those means, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.86

but ceaseth willingly euen to establish men in errour, and in most
wicked prophaning of the name of God, and worshipping of himselfe,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.87

and so entreth deeper into them.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.88

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I beseech you let me heare how that is, that you
say he ceaseth of his own accord.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.89

Will he let goe his hold willingly and of his owne accord, where he hath
it vpon any man?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.90

Doth he not desire to do hurt?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.91

<font> Dan. <$$font> He doeth not let goe his hold which he hath
vpon any man, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.92

but indeed taketh faster holde when hee seemeth to be cast foorth and
doth greater hurt: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.93

for tel me whose deuise is the coniuration?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.94

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I am out of doubt that coniuration is the deuice
of the deuill.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.95

<font> Dan. <$$font> Then tell me, hath the deuill deuised
and taught a way to bind himselfe, or to cast forth himselfe?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.96

<font> M.B.  <$$font> That I suppose he would neuer doe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.97

<font> Dan. <$$font> Indeed if we wil imagine that the deuil is
becom an old foole; GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.98

we may think he wold teach that which should bind and cast foorth himselfe
: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.99

but the scripture calleth him the old serpent: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.100

he deuised and taught coniuration, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.101

therefore coniuration doth not cast him foorth.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.102

Yet he seemeth to be bound by the co~iurer, yea euen by the name of God,
and by the power of the passion of Christ.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.103

The coniurer seemeth by the same power to driue him out of a man possessed
, whose body he doth vex & torment.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.104

And he ceaseth willingly to torment the bodie, to establish coniuration,
& so to draw men quite from God, euen to worship and to follow himselfe,
and seeke all helpes at his hands.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.105

Euen so when men are tormented in their bodies, or plagued in their
cattell by the deuill, and seeke vnto the cunning men and women, following
the way that they prescribe vnto them, and haue ease in their bodies,
and no more harme among their cattell, Satan doth not giue place as
forced, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4R.106

but ceaseth to do <P_F4V> those bodilie harmes, that he may fullie win
vnto himselfe both bodie and soule.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.107

If they should not seeme to bee expelled, how should men be drawn to
seek help at their handes which deale by him?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.108

how should witches and coniurers be drawne on most horriblie to pollute
and blaspheme the glorious name of God?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.109

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Then I see they buy their help deer which haue it
at the handes of these cunning men.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.110

<font> Dan. <$$font> Yea, what can be bought more deare, than
that which is with the losse of soule and bodie for euer, by running
from God after deuils?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.111

<font> M.B.  <$$font> What shoulde a man thinke then touching all other
which deale not with the deuill, and yet haue certaine waies to finde out
witches, and to vnwitch that which they haue done?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.112

<font> Dan. <$$font> Although they deale not directly by the
deuill, I meane they haue no familiar spirites that speake vnto them
yet they deale by deuillish deuises, which are also an abhomination to
the Lord.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.113

For all those seuerall sortes of witches which the Lord rehearseth, <font>
Deut. 18. <$$font> did not deale directlie with deuils.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.114

For some were obseruers of times, which had their luckie dayes and their
vnluckie dayes, and so their howers.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.115

If they goe to buy or to sell, they choose their hower to set foorth in.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.116

Some dealt by the intralles of beasts, and by the flying of birds,
by meeting with an hare, or a foxe, and on which hand, & a thousand
such like.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.117

Some deal with the Siue and paire of sheeres, vsing certaine words:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.118

Some vse a charme for the tooth ach, another for the ague, and for
stopping the bleeding at the nose, also their spell for the theefe,
and a thousande such like, when butter will not come, when cheese will
not runne, nor Ale worke in the fatte: GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.119

These would seeme of all others to haue witches in the greatest
detestation, GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.120

and in the meane time worke by the deuill themselues,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.121

and may bee termed witches.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,F4V.122

<P_G1R>

<font> M.B.  <$$font> We doe count them witches which haue their spirits
, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.124

we doe not take them to be witches which doe but vse those things which
the cunning men haue taught.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.125

For they doe not mean to doe any thing by the deuill.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.126

Me thinketh therefore it is hard to call them witches.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.127

<font> Dan. <$$font> Take the name of witchcraft for all that
dealeth by the power and deuices of the deuill.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.128

No doubt some are more horrible than other of the seuerall sortes of
witches, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.129

yet the lightest of them be abhominations before the Lord, as we are
taught, <font> Deut. 18. <$$font> GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.130

and the ignorance doeth not excuse.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.131

For what though the witch suppose it is the soule of Moses, which
appeareth in his Chrystal, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.132

is he not therfore a witch?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.133

Your neighbour, whose butter wold not come, which heat a spit red hoat
and thrust into the creame, vsing certaine wordes, doth thinke she did
by the power of God fray away the deuil, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.134

is she therefore a witch, dealing with that which the deuil, and not
God hath taught?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.135

Is she not a witch also in seeking help at deuils?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.136

They which did burne the cloaths which their child lay in, to know by
the burning blacke whether it were bewitched, and to bring the witch
thither, dealt altogether by the power and direction of the deuill,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.137

& so in scratching, for God hath taught no such things, then are they
not witches?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.138

By whose instruction, and by whose power was the witch fetched
home at the burning of the hair of the butchers sonne you spake of?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.139

Was not all done by the power of Satan, and by his instruction?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.140

Are not they then which practize the thinges the Disciples of witches,
& so indeed very witches?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.141

Those which haue their charmes, and their night spels, what can they be
but witches?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.142

I might reckon vp her that dealeth with the siue and the sheares, and
a number of such trumperies, in all which the most holie name of God is
polluted, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.143

and if any thing be done, it is done wholly by the effectuall working
of Satan.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.144

God hath giuen naturall helps, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1R.145

and those we may vse, as from his hand against naturall <P_G1V> diseases
, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.146

but things besides nature he hath not appointed, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.147

especiallie, they be ridiculous to driue away deuilles and diseases.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.148

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Now you speak of naturall things,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.149

we see there be great secretes in nature: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.150

the Adamant draweth Iron vnto it.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.151

And why $may {TEXT:m_ay} there not be some force in these naturall
things then?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.152

<font> Dan. <$$font> No doubt there be great secrets in nature,
which the skilfull physicians, and naturall Philosophers do find out.
As the hanging of some thinge about the necke, may haue force to driue
away the ague, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.153

the wearing of some thing may haue such vertue to deliuer from the cramp,
and such like.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.154

And from these Satan doeth take occasion to bring in his trumperies
, and curious deuiles.  As because there be secretes in nature, a
ring is curiouslie framed according to the signes in the firmament,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.155

this is tied to a thread, and let down into a basen or cup of water,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.156

and wil shew great things.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.157

Because there be secretes in nature, a horshoo must be heat red hot,
and then put into a kettle seething vpon the fire to driue away the
witches spirite.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.158

Also he that hath his cattle bewitched, burneth some liue thing, as
hogge or henne, to driue out the deuill.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.159

Can these naturall thinges expell deuils?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.160

Nay, they play the rancke witches, which burne any thing for to expell
deuils: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.161

for, hath God taught to do anie such thing?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.162

Doe they burne the thing to God, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.163

or is it as a verie burnt sacrifice to the Deuill?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.164

In the time of the law burnt sacrifices were offred to God:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.165

the deuill among the heathen drewe the like to himself:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.166

And now by his sleight he doth after some sort procure the same at their
hands, which professe to be Christians, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.167

and thus worshipping him, he ceaseth from hurting their bodies, or their
cattell, as gaining a greater matter.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.168

<font> M.B.  <$$font> If it be so <paren> as I am not able to gainsay
it <$$paren> then be there multitudes in all places which are guiltie
of sorcerie and witchcraft.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G1V.169

For I see many deale in matters by <P_G2R> the help and power of the
deuill, which are perswaded otherwise.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.170

But I meruaile much at diuers things touching the help which men haue
by deuils.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.171

Let vs conferre a little about them.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.172

The deuill doeth know things past, & things present, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.173

but God onelie doth know what shall bee done in the time to come.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.174

If these cunning men doe deale with no further power, than the power
of the deuill, howe can they tell so right what shall come to passe?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.175

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is peculiar to God alone, to know what
shall come to passe hereafter.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.176

But the Lord God hath reuealed by his Prophetes, and Apostles many
thinges that after should be fulfilled.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.177

Satan can giue a nere coniecture when these come to be fulfilled.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.178

Hee is a most subtill obseruer of thinges, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.179

and will gesse at many: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.180

but especially, where hee hath power giuen him to worke and to bring any
matter about, he can and will tell it aforehand.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.181

Finally, God in his iust iudgement giueth him power to seduce the wicked.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.182

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I pray you open your meaning more fully.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.183

<font> Dan. <$$font> Very well: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.184

In which haue you any doubt?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.185

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I take it the Deuill gesseth at things which are
prophecied, and is a sharpe obseruer of causes.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.186

But you said he telleth what shall be where he worketh that which he
foretelleth: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.187

giue some example for this.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.188

<font> Dan. <$$font> There needeth no better example, than
that which you tolde of the Churchwardens that went to the cunning
man, to knowe the theefe which had stollen their communion cuppe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.189

It may be sayd, where the cunning man bad them go to such a place, such
a night, and at such an hower, and thither shall come he that stole the
cup, how could the deuill tell it, if it were a night or two after, that
he should come to that place, and at that hower?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.190

You muste note what power the deuill hath in the mind of a theefe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.191

He stirred him vp to steale the cup.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.192

He stirred vp the Churchwardens to seeke to the cunning witch.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2R.193

Hee nameth the place and the time, whether, and when he would moue the
<P_G2V> heart of the theefe to come: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.194

And at the time appointed hee bringeth him thither, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.195

for he that could moue him to steale, could also by secrete suggestion
mooue him to goe thither.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.196

The deuill told that the witch shuld come home with speed that had
bewitched the butchers son: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.197

He that had power in her heart to make her become a witch, did
know he should haue power to make her with haste to come home.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.198

One carieth somewhat which a sick person hath lien in to the cunning man.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.199

He can tell, it seemeth, by the smell of the cloth, whether the
deuil hath bene in it <paren> if it smell like his deuill <$$paren>
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.200

and so telleth, the partie is bewitched.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.201

Take the clothes which the sicke partie hath lien in, and burne them,
if they burne blacke, then may you see it is so, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.202

and the witch shall come in while they be a burning.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.203

Nowe, if the Lord gaue him power, and he hath striken and tormented
the bodie of the sicke person: and if hee haue collourably stirred vp
a witch to send him: is it not an easie matter for him to make the
fire burne blacke, and to mooue the witch to come at that present?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.204

Or if he haue power for to torment, and hath no witch to sende him,
his great desire being to haue men guiltie of innocent blood, is it
not as easie by the permission of God, which in his iust iudgment,
giueth him power to seduce such people as will hearken vnto deuils,
for him to make the fire burne blacke, or at least to seeme so to them,
and to mooue some frowarde suspected woman or other to come in, though
she be no witch?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.205

A thousande such things hee worketh in, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.206

and as a cunning iuggler can compasse and bring them about.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.207

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Indeed an innocent person may come in at such a
time: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.208

but I haue heard, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} tell howe true it
is, that therefore there is a further thing which they obserue.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.209

And that is this, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.210

the cunning man biddeth, set on a posnet or some pan with nayles,
and seeth them, and the witch shal come in while they be in seething,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.211

and within a fewe dayes after, her face will be all bescratched with
the nailes.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G2V.212

And <P_G3R> I haue heard that some olde woman comming in, her face
hath indeed bene as it were scratched within a few dayes after,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.213

for the shingles or such like brake forth.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.214

<font> Dan. <$$font> O the depth of Satans illusions to make
blinde people becom witches, and to deale by him.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.215

He doth know the corrupted humours in the bodie, which will breake out
into the smal pockes, or such like, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.216

and if he can procure one to come in which is euen ready to haue them,
what a shew doth he make, as if the nails did it?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.217

<font> M.B.  <$$font> This were great subtiltie of Satan.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.218

<font> Dan. <$$font> Nay, we are not able to imagine the depth
of his sleights, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.219

neither can we see the secrete force, wherwith he moueth the
minds of ignorant people, and so bringeth about his enterprises.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.220

There doth lie the greatest cunning of Satan.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.221

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Indeed it seemeth strange and vncredible that the
deuil should so moue the minds of men, and lead them vnto this thing
and that thing, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.222

and in the meane time they doe not know it, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.223

but thinke they goe against the deuil.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.224

But now I haue a further doubt.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.225

I confesse it is an easie thing for the deuill to tell where a thing is
that is lost or stollen, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.226

but what power hath he to heale that which is sick or sore?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.227

Out of question they be innumerable which receiue helpe by going to the
cunning men.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.228

You say he helpeth the bodie that he may destroy the soule.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.229

Hee helpeth that men may seeke vnto him, and so set him, as it were,
in the place of God.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.230

Me thinketh it should not be in the power of deuilles for to helpe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.231

<font> Dan. <$$font> Indeed that is well mooued,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.232

there lieth a great sleight of the deuill in it.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.233

You say that innumerable do receiue help by going vnto cunning men.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.234

I warrant you not so many as you are perswaded {receive_help}
{receive_help}.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.235

<font> M.B.  <$$font> O verie manie.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.236

There be a number which doe neuer make it knowne, because it is misliked
by some.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3R.237

<font> Dan. <$$font> Yea, and there be many which come home again
<P_G3V> with a flea in their eare, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.238

they receiue an answere, as good as a flim flam.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.239

<font> M.B.  <$$font> It may be they come too late, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.240

the matter is ouer farre spent, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.241

and if they had come sooner, they could haue holpen them.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.242

<font> Dan. <$$font> Yea, a number of such cosoning answers
the deuill maketh which satisfie ignorant people, which are $ready
{TEXT:rea-} to beleeue all that he telleth, and to daunce after his pipe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.243

One commeth to him for his childe, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.244

if he know the disease be deadly, he will say it is bewitched, but so
farre spent, that there is no help, the childe will hardlie liue two
daies: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.245

the father commeth home GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.246

and findeth his child deade, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.247

or it dieth within two or three dayes after, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.248

here the deuill getteth credit.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.249

Another is sicke and grieously tormented, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.250

hee sendeth: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.251

Satan doth see <paren> for he sendeth them <$$paren> that the disease
is euen spent, and that the cause of it begin to fail, and so that the
partie in a few dayes will recouer, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.252

here he prescribeth one paltrie or other, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.253

they vse it, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.254

the man is recouered, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.255

and so should haue bene without the deuils medicine, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.256

but now Satan hath gotten further credite.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.257

Another is sicke GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.258

and languisheth, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.259

his neighbours tell him, he may be bewitched, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.260

it is good to send, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.261

and then he shal know.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.262

He sendeth, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.263

the deuill doth not know whether the sicke man can escape and recouer,
or not.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.264

He saith, it is like he is bewitched: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.265

and teacheth what to doe, if there bee any help at all,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.266

but doubteth, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.267

and so whether the man liue or die, Satan saueth his credite whole
and sound.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.268

And many of these answeres he giueth.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.269

Againe, we must note that mans imagination is of great force, either
to continue a disease, or to diminish and take away some diseases.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.270

And in this also Satan deludeth some, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.271

for his medicine seemeth to do somwhat, when it is but the Parties
conceit.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.272

<font> M.B.  <$$font> These be sleights indeede: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.273

but mee thinketh you goe farre in the last.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.274

I doe not see how a mans conceit can help him.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G3V.275

<P_G4R>

<font> Dan. <$$font> Imagination is a strong thing to hurt,
all men doe finde, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.277

and why should it not then be strong also to help, when the
parties mind is cleared, by beleeuing fully that he receiueth ease?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.278

<font> M.B.  <$$font> But yet it is hard to shewe that euer anie such
cure hath bene wrought.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.279

<font> Dan. <$$font> It is not hard to shew, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.280

for that which men doe, it is presumed the deuill can doe the like.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.281

And I haue heard of a mery companion that wrought such a cure.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.282

Ther was one in London <paren> as report goeth <$$paren> which was
acquainted with Feats.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.283

Now, this Feats had a blacke dogge, whome he called <font> Bomelius
<$$font>.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.284

This partie afterward had a conceit that <font> Bomelius <$$font> was
a deuill, and that hee felt him within him.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.285

He was in heauinesse, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.286

and made his moane to one of his acquaintance, who had a merie head,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.287

he tolde him, hee had a friend who could remooue <font> Bomelius <$$font>.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.288

Hee had him prepare a breakfast, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.289

and he would bring him.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.290

Then this was the cure, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.291

he made him be stripped naked and stand by a good fire,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.292

and though he were fatte ynough of himselfe, basted him all ouer with
butter against the fire, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.293

and made him weare a sleeke stone next his skin vnder his bellie,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.294

and the man had present remedie, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.295

and gaue him afterward greate thankes.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.296

<font> M.B.  <$$font> I know men haue many foolish imaginations:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.297

but though one imagination may driue out another, which is not the curing
of any disease in deed, but of an imagination: yet it doth not followe,
that where there is an appareant griefe, that a mans conceit can helpe
to cure it.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.298

<font> Dan. <$$font> Yes, the conceit doth much, euen where there
is an apparant disease.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.299

A man feareth hee is bewitched, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.300

it troubleth al the powers of his mind, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.301

and that distempereth his bodie, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.302

maketh great alterations in it, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.303

and bringeth sundrie griefes.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.304

Now, when his minde is freed from such imaginations, his bodily griefe
which $grew {TEXT:g_rew} from the same is eased.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.305

And a multitude of Satans cures are but such.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4R.306

<P_G4V>

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Nay, there be also euils which be apparant in
the bodie, and bee cured, which come not of anie feare or imagination:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.308

how can these be cured by any conceit?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.309

There is great reason that such griefes may be cured indeede by
quieting the minde, and did growe from the disturbance of the same.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.310

<font> Dan. <$$font> Yea, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.311

and that falleth out sometimes in griefes of the body, which doeth not
growe from imagination, but from some other passions.  As I can giue
you an example, which is written and reported on by a very reuerend
learned Physitian.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.312

The cure was done by a lewde cosening knaue in Germanie.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.313

A woman had bleare eies that were watery.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.314

The knaue lodging there, promised for certainty that hee would heale
them: GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.315

hee did hang a litle writing about her necke, charging strictlie
, that it should not be taken from thence nor read, nor opened,
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.316

for if any of these were done, she could haue no help at all by it.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.317

The woman had such a confidence in the thinge, and was so merry and glad,
that she left weeping GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.318

<paren> for her often weeping and tears had spoiled her eies <$$paren>
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.319

and so by little and litle, the moysture stayed, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.320

and her eies were whole.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.321

It fell out that she lost the writing, where at she was in such
griefe and sorrowe, and weeping, that her eies were sore againe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.322

Another founde the writing, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.323

opened it, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.324

and read it.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.325

It was written in the Germane tongue, to this effect translated into
English: <font> The deuill pluck out thine eies, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.326

and fill their holes with dung.  <$$font> GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.327

Was not this, thinke you, a proper salue for to cure her eies?
GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.328

If this medicine had taken effect, her eies shuld not haue ben healed,
but plucked quite out.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.329

We may not think that Satan hath mo cousening tricks than al men in the
world, GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.330

for men are but his schollers.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.331

Againe, where men faile, he can worke somewhat in the affections of the
parties mindes.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.332

And you shall heare them say, when any charme is vsed, you must beleeue it
will helpe, or els it will doe you no good at all.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,G4V.333

Thus if it were well seene into, <P_H1R> the greatest part of your
innumerable cures, come to bee mere cosonages.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.334

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Well, let all this be true as you haue saide:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.335

yet there be many thinges wherein the deuilles doe helpe.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.336

What say you to the boy which healed within few daies $after {TEXT:af}
he had scratched the witch, whereas his sores were most grieuous before,
and could not be cured?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.337

What say you to that which they doe, when butter will not come, or when
drinke will not worke in the fat?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.338

What say you to the burning of some liue thing, as hogge or henne,
and the harme ceassing?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.339

And finallie, what say you to the helping of them where the deuill is,
and doth torment their bodies?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.340

<font> Dan. <$$font> All these are answered in few wordes, that
where he hath power to hurt either man or beast, drinke or butter he
helpeth only by giuing place, and ceasing to hurt, which as I shewed
you before, he doth most willinglie, to bring to passe, that men may
seek to him, & become euen verie witches.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.341

If a man be vexed & tormented by a deuil, & men seek by fasting &
prayer to cast him foorth, euen instantly intreating the Lord, the~
he goeth out with much a do, and vnwillingly, as ouercome & expelled by
the power of God.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.342

But when he hurteth, as you say he did the butchers sonne, and they seeke
to him, and will followe his prescriptions, as to draw blood of the witch,
he goeth out willingly, GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.343

I meane he ceaseth from hurting the bodie: GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.344

for he goeth not out indeede, GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.345

but rather goeth further in, GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.346

and seateth himselfe deeper in the soule.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.347

And so is it in all the rest.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.348

How gladlie wil he cease to hurte the hennes, so that to please him,
a henne may be burnt aliue?  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.349

his helping is no more but a ceasing from doing harme, if he had power
giuen him to hurt.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.350

<font> Sam. <$$font> This is a strange thing if it be so.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.351

There be thousands in the land deceiued.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.352

The woman at <font> R.H.  <$$font> by report hath some weeke fourtie
come vnto her, GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.353

and many of them not of the meaner sort.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.354

But I doe but hinder, GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.355

I pray you go forward.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1R.356

<P_H1V>

<font> Dan. <$$font> The deuill can deceiue thousand thousands,
and euen the wisest for this world, GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.358

when they will not be taught of God, but dispise his doctrine,
then are they iustly giuen ouer to be disciples of the deuill.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.359

<font> M.B.  <$$font> If there be such deceit in all these things, and
that the witches do not kill nor hurt, but the deuill craftilie seemeth
to kill and to hurt when the diseases be naturall and maketh the witch
beleeue that hee hath done all at her request.  Or where God hath giuen
him power, he stirreth her vp to send him, as if either hee could not ,
or would not meddle, vnles he had bene sent.  Seeing all lieth vpon Satan,
it should seeme, there is no reason that witches should be put to death:
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.360

but the scripture doth command they shuld be put to death.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.361

<font> Dan. <$$font> The holy scriptures doe command that witches
should be put to death: GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.362

therein you say right: GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.363

but if you did take it, that the word of God commaundeth they shall
not be suffered to liue, because they kill men and beastes, or because
they send their spirits which possesse men, and torment their bodies,
you are much deceiued: GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.364

For you shal neuer finde, of all that haue bene tormented and plagued
by euill spirites, that the holie Ghoste layeth it vpon witches.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.365

The causes why they should be put to death are, that they haue
familiaritie with deuils, which are the blasphemous enemies of God:
and that they seduce the people into errour, to runne after deuils
, and deuilish practises, and that they haue such wicked minds.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.366

Although they neuer minde to kill or to hurt any, but to doe them good,
as they imagine, yet if they deale with deuilles they ought to die for it.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.367

<font> M.B.  <$$font> Then you take it, that these cunning men and
women , vnto whome so many runne for helpe, which are thought to do very
much good, and no hurt at all, ought to be rooted out, and destroyed.
GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.368

Let vs knowe what scripture there is to it.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H1V.369

<P_H2R>

<font> Dan. <$$font> yea, of all other they ought to die, because
they doe the greatest harme.  GIFFORD-E2-P2,H2R.371

Other witches that haue spirites are thought to doe harm, because the
deuil at the appointment of God doth harme, and he beareth in hand hee
doeth it at the request of the witch: GIFFORD-E2-P2,H2R.372

but these that seeme to doe good, do harme indeed, and that many wayes,
