To falowe.  FITZH-E1-P2,25.4

<$$heading>

Nowe these housbandes haue sowen theyr pees, beanes, barley, and otes,
and harowed them, it is the beste tyme, to falowe, in the later ende of
Marche and Apryll, for whete, rye, and barley.  FITZH-E1-P2,25.6

And lette the husbande do the <P_26> beste he can, to plowe a brode forowe
and a depe, soo that he turne it cleane, and lay it flat, that it rere
not on the edge: the whiche shall destroy all the thistils and wedes.
FITZH-E1-P2,26.7

For the deper and the broder that he gothe, the more newe molde, and
the greatter clottes shall he haue, FITZH-E1-P2,26.8

and the greatter clottes, the better wheate.  FITZH-E1-P2,26.9

For the clottes kepe the wheate warme all wynter, FITZH-E1-P2,26.10

and at Marche they wyll melte and breake, and fal in manye small
peces, the whiche is a newe dongynge, and refresshynge of the corne.
FITZH-E1-P2,26.11

And also there shall but lyttell wedes growe vpon the falowes, that are
so falowed.  FITZH-E1-P2,26.12

For the plough goth vndernethe the rootes of all maner of wedes,
FITZH-E1-P2,26.13

and tourneth the roote vpwarde, that it maye not growe.  FITZH-E1-P2,26.14

And yf the lande be falowed in wynter tyme, it is farre the worse,
for three principall causes.  FITZH-E1-P2,26.15

One is, all the rayne that commeth, shal washe the lande, and dryue awaye
the dounge and the good moulde, that the lande shall be moche the worse.
FITZH-E1-P2,26.16

An other cause is, the rayne shall beate the lande so flat, and bake
it so hard to-gyther, that if a drye Maye come, it wyll be to harde to
stere in the moneth of June.  FITZH-E1-P2,26.17

And the thyrde cause is, the wiedes shall take suche roote, er
sterynge-tyme comme, that they wylle not be cleane tourned vndernethe,
the whiche shal be great hurte to the corne, whan it shall be sowen,
and specially in the weding-tyme of the same; FITZH-E1-P2,26.18

and for any other thynne, make a depe holowe forowe in the rydge of the
lande, FITZH-E1-P2,26.19

and loke wel, thou rest-balke it nat; FITZH-E1-P2,26.20

for if thou do, there wyll be many thystels: FITZH-E1-P2,26.21

and than thou shalte not make a cleane rydge at the fyrste sterynge,
FITZH-E1-P2,26.22

and therfore it muste nedes be depe plowed, FITZH-E1-P2,26.23

or elles thou shalt nat tourne the wiedes cleane.  FITZH-E1-P2,26.24

To cary out donge or mucke and to sprede it.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.28

<$$heading>

And in the later ende of Apryll, and the begynnynge of Maye, is tyme to
cary out his dounge or mucke, and to lay it vppon his barley-grounde.
FITZH-E1-P2,27.30

And where he hath barley this yere, sowe it with whete or rye the next
tyme it is falowed, FITZH-E1-P2,27.31

and so shal he mucke all his landes ouer at euerye seconde falowe.
FITZH-E1-P2,27.32

But that husbande that can fynd the meanes to cary oute his donge, and
to laye it vpon his lande after it be ones sturred: it is moche better
than to laye it vppon his falowe, for dyuer causes.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.33

One is, if it be layde vpon his fallowe, all that fallethe in the holowe
rygge shall do lyttell good; FITZH-E1-P2,27.34

for whan it is rygged agayne, it lyeth soo depe in the erthe, that it
wyll not be plowed vp agayne, excepte that whan he hath sprede it,
he wyll with a shouell, or a spade, caste out all that is fallen in
the rygge.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.35

And if it be layde vpon the sturrynge, at euery plowynge it shall medle
the donge and the erthe togyder, the whiche shall cause the corne moche
better to growe and encreace.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.36

And in somme places, they lode not theyr donge, tyll harvest be done,
FITZH-E1-P2,27.37

& that is vsed in the farther syde of Darbyshyre, called Scaresdale ,
Halomshyre, and so northewarde towarde Yorke and Ryppon: FITZH-E1-P2,27.38

and that I calle better thanne vppon the falowe, and specyally for barley:
FITZH-E1-P2,27.39

but vppon the fyrste sturrynge, is beste for wheate and rye,
FITZH-E1-P2,27.40

and that his dunge be layde vpon smal hepes nygh together,
FITZH-E1-P2,27.41

and to sprede it euenly, and to leue no dounge there-as the mucke-hepe
stode, FITZH-E1-P2,27.42

for the moystnes of the dounge shall cause the grounde to be ranke
ynoughe.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.43

And if it be medled with erthe, as sholynges and suche other, it wyll
laste the longer, and better for barley than for whete or rye, bycause
of wedes.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.44

Horse-donge is the worste donge that is.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.45

The donge of all maner catell, that chewe theyr cudde, is verye good.
FITZH-E1-P2,27.46

And the dounge of douues is best, FITZH-E1-P2,27.47

but it must be layde vppon the grounde verye thynne.  FITZH-E1-P2,27.48

18. FITZH-E1-P2,28.51

To set out the shepe-folde.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.52

<$$heading>

Also it is tyme to set out the shepefolde in May, and to sette it vppon
the rye-grounde, if he haue any, and to flyte it euery mornynge or nyght
: and in the mornynge, whan he cometh to his folde, let not his shepe
out anone, but reyse theym vp, and let them stande stylle good season,
that they may donge and pysse.  And go amonge them to se whether any of
them haue any mathes, or be scabbed: and se them thre or foure tymes on
the oone syde, and as ofte on the other syde.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.54

And whan the kelles begonne besyde the grounde, than lette theym out of
the folde, FITZH-E1-P2,28.55

and dryue theym to the soundest place of the felde.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.56

But he that hath a falowe felde, seueral to hym-selfe, let hym occupie
no folde.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.57

For foldynge of shepe maketh them scabbed, FITZH-E1-P2,28.58

and bredeth mathes; FITZH-E1-P2,28.59

and whanne a storme of yll wether commeth in the night, they can nat
flee nor go awaye, FITZH-E1-P2,28.60

and that appeyreth them sore of their flesshe.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.61

But lette that man that hath such a seueral falowe-felde, driue twentie
, thyrty, or forty stakes, accordynge to the nombre of his shepe , upon
his falowe, where he wolde sette his folde, and specially in the farthest
parte of the fyelde frome thense as they comme in, FITZH-E1-P2,28.62

for the goynge vppon dothe moche good.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.63

And lette the sheparde brynge his shepe to the stakes, and the sheepe
wylle rubbe them on the stakes.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.64

And lette the sheparde goo aboute them, tyll they be sette, and thus
serue theym two or three nyghtes, and they wyll folowe those stakes,
as he flytteth them, and syt by them.  FITZH-E1-P2,28.65

And if any ill wether come, they will ryse vp, and go to the hedge.
FITZH-E1-P2,28.66

And this maner of foldynge shall brede noo mathes nor scabbe, nor appeyre
theym of theyr flesshe, FITZH-E1-P2,28.67

and shall be a greate sauegarde to the shepe for rottynge:
FITZH-E1-P2,28.68

and in the mornynge put them out of theyr pasture, and thou shalte not
nede to bye any <P_29> hurdels nor shepe-flekes; FITZH-E1-P2,29.69

but howe ye shall salue them or dresse them, ye shall vnderstande in
the chaypter of shepe after.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.70

<$$heading>

And in May, whan thou hast falowed thy grounde, and set oute thy
shepefolde, and carved oute thy dounge or mucke, if thou haue any
wodde, cole, or tymbre to cary, or suche other busynes, that moste
nedes be doone, with thy charte or wayne, than is it tyme to do it.
FITZH-E1-P2,29.75

For than the waye is lyke to be fayre and drye, and the days longe,
FITZH-E1-P2,29.76

and that tyme the husbande hath leeste to doo in husbandry.
FITZH-E1-P2,29.77

Perauenture I set one thynge to be done at one tyme of the yere,
FITZH-E1-P2,29.78

and if the husbande shulde do it, it shulde be a greatter losse to hym
in an other thynge.  Wherefore it is moste conuenient to do that thynge
fyrst, that is moste profytable to hym, and as soone as he can, do the
other labour.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.79

To knowe dyuers maner of wedes.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.82

<$$heading>

In the later ende of Maye, and the begynnynge of June, is tyme to wede
thy corne.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.84

There be diuers maner of wedes, as thistyls, kedlokes, dockes, cocledrake,
darnolde, gouldes, haudoddes, dogfenell, mathes, ter, and dyuers other
small wedes.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.85

But these be they that greue mooste: FITZH-E1-P2,29.86

The thistyll is an yll wede, roughe and sharpe to handell,
FITZH-E1-P2,29.87

and freteth away the cornes nygh it, FITZH-E1-P2,29.88

and causeth the sherers or reapers not to shere cleane.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.89

Kedlokes hath a leafe lyke rapes, FITZH-E1-P2,29.90

and beareth a yelowe floure, FITZH-E1-P2,29.91

and is an yll wede, FITZH-E1-P2,29.92

and groweth in al maner corne, FITZH-E1-P2,29.93

and hath small coddes, FITZH-E1-P2,29.94

and groweth lyke mustard sede.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.95

Dockes have a brode lefe, and diuers high spyres, and very small sede
in the toppe.  FITZH-E1-P2,29.96

Cockole hath a longe small lefe, FITZH-E1-P2,29.97

and wyl beare fyue or vi. floures of purple colour, as <P_30>
brode as a grote, FITZH-E1-P2,30.98

and the sede is rounde and blacke, FITZH-E1-P2,30.99

and maye well be suffred in a breade-corne, but not in sede,
FITZH-E1-P2,30.100

for therin is moche floure.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.101

Drake is lyke vnto rye, till it begynne to sede, FITZH-E1-P2,30.102

and it hath many sedes lyke fenell-sedes, FITZH-E1-P2,30.103

and hangeth downewarde, FITZH-E1-P2,30.104

and it maye wel be suffred in breade, FITZH-E1-P2,30.105

for there is moche floure in the sede: FITZH-E1-P2,30.106

and it is an opinion that it commeth of rye, &c.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.107

Dernolde groweth vp streyght lyke an hye grasse, FITZH-E1-P2,30.108

and hath longe sedes on eyther syde the sterte, FITZH-E1-P2,30.109

and there is moche floure in that sede, FITZH-E1-P2,30.110

and growethe moche amonge barley: FITZH-E1-P2,30.111

and it is sayde, that it cometh of small barley.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.112

Golds hath a shorte iagged lefe, FITZH-E1-P2,30.113

and groweth halfe a yarde hygh, FITZH-E1-P2,30.114

and hath a yelowe floure, as brode as a grote, FITZH-E1-P2,30.115

and is an yll wede, FITZH-E1-P2,30.116

and groweth commonlye in barleye and pees.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.117

Hawdod hath a blewe floure, and a fewe lyttell leues, FITZH-E1-P2,30.118

and hath v. or syxe braunches, floured in the toppe:
FITZH-E1-P2,30.119

and groweth comonly in rye vpon leane grounde, FITZH-E1-P2,30.120

and dothe lyttel hurte.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.121

Doggefenell and mathes is bothe one, FITZH-E1-P2,30.122

and in the commynge vp is lyke fenell FITZH-E1-P2,30.123

and beareth many white floures, with a yelowe sede: FITZH-E1-P2,30.124

and is the worste wede that is, excepte terre, FITZH-E1-P2,30.125

and it commeth moste commonly, whan great wete commeth shortly after
the corne is sowen.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.126

Terre is the worste wede, FITZH-E1-P2,30.127

and it neuer dothe appere tyll the moneth of June, and specyallye whanne
there is great wete in that mone, or a lyttell before, FITZH-E1-P2,30.128

and groweth mooste in rye, FITZH-E1-P2,30.129

and it groweth lyke fytches, FITZH-E1-P2,30.130

but it is moche smaller, FITZH-E1-P2,30.131

and it wyll growe as hyghe as the corne, FITZH-E1-P2,30.132

and with the weyght therof it pulleth the corne flatte to the erth,
FITZH-E1-P2,30.133

and freteth the eares away; wherfore I haue seene housbandes mowe downe
the corne and it together: And also with sharp hokes to repe it, as they
doo pees, FITZH-E1-P2,30.134

and made drye, FITZH-E1-P2,30.135

and than it wyll be good fodder.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.136

There be other weeds not spoken of, as dee-nettylles, dodder, and suche
other, that doo moche harme.  FITZH-E1-P2,30.137

Howe to wede corne.  FITZH-E1-P2,31.141

<$$heading>

Nowe it wolde be knowen, howe these cornes shulde be weded.
FITZH-E1-P2,31.143

The chyefe instrument to wede with is a paire of tonges made of wode,
FITZH-E1-P2,31.144

and in the farther ende it is nycked, to holde the wed faster;
FITZH-E1-P2,31.145

and after a shoure of raine it is beste wedynge, FITZH-E1-P2,31.146

for than they maye be pulled vp by the rotes, FITZH-E1-P2,31.147

and than it cometh neuer agayne.  FITZH-E1-P2,31.148

And if it be drye wether, than muste ye haue a wedynge-hoke with a socket
set vpon a lyttel staffe of a yarde longe, FITZH-E1-P2,31.149

and this hoke wolde be well steeled, and grounde sharpe bothe behynde
and before.  FITZH-E1-P2,31.150

And in his other hande he hath a forked stycke a yarde longe,
FITZH-E1-P2,31.151

and with his forked stycke he putteth the wede from hym,
FITZH-E1-P2,31.152

and he putteth the hoke beyond the rote of the wede, FITZH-E1-P2,31.153

and pulleth it to hym, FITZH-E1-P2,31.154

and cutteth the wede fast by the erthe, FITZH-E1-P2,31.155

and with his hoke he taketh up the wede, FITZH-E1-P2,31.156

and casteth it in the reane, FITZH-E1-P2,31.157

and if the reane be full of corne, it is better it stande styll, whan
it is cut, and wyddre: FITZH-E1-P2,31.158

but let hym beware, that he trede not to moche vppon the corne, and
specyallye after it is shotte, and whan he cutteth the wede, that he
cut not the corne: FITZH-E1-P2,31.159

and therefore the hoke wolde not passe an inche wyde.  FITZH-E1-P2,31.160

And whanne the wede is soo shorte, that he can not with his forked
stycke put it from hym, and with the hoke pull it to hym, thanne muste
he set his hoke vppon the wede, fast by the erthe, and put it from hym,
FITZH-E1-P2,31.161

and so shall he cutte it cleane.  FITZH-E1-P2,31.162

And with these two instruments, he shall neuer stoupe to his warke.
FITZH-E1-P2,31.163

Dogfenell, goldes, mathes, and kedlokes are yll to wede after this maner,
they growe vppon so many braunches, harde by the erthe: FITZH-E1-P2,31.164

and therfore they vse most to pul them vppe with theyr handes;
FITZH-E1-P2,31.165

but loke well, that they pull not vppe the corne with all;
FITZH-E1-P2,31.166

but as for terre, there wyll noo wedynge serue.  FITZH-E1-P2,31.167

The fyrst sturrynge.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.171

Also in June is tyme to rygge vppe the falowe, the whiche is called the
fyrst sturrynge, and to plowe it as depe as thou canste, for to tourne
the rotes of the wedgs vpwarde, that the sonne and the drye wether maye
kyll them.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.173

And an housbande can not conuenyentelye plowe his lande, and lode
out his dounge bothe vppon a daye, with one draughte of beastes:
FITZH-E1-P2,32.174

but he maye well lode oute his dounge before none, and lode heye or
corne at- after none: FITZH-E1-P2,32.175

or he maye plowe before none, and lode hey or corne at- after none,
with the same draughte, FITZH-E1-P2,32.176

and noo hurte to the cattell: bycause in lodynge of hey or corne, the
cattel is alwaye eatynge or beytynge, FITZH-E1-P2,32.177

and soo they can not doo in lodynge of dounge and plowynge.

To mowe grasse.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.181

<$$heading>

Also in the later ende of June is tyme to begyn to mowe, if thy medowe
be well growen: FITZH-E1-P2,32.183

but howe-so-ever they be growen, in July they muste nedes mowe, for
diuers causes.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.184

One is, it is not convenient to haue hey and corne bothe in occupation
at one tyme.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.185

An other is, the yonger and the grener that the grasse is, the softer
and the sweter it wyll be, whan it is hey, FITZH-E1-P2,32.186

but it wyll haue the more wyddrynge; FITZH-E1-P2,32.187

and the elder the grasse is, the harder and dryer it is, and the worse
for al maner of cattell: FITZH-E1-P2,32.188

for the sedes be fallen, the whiche is in maner of prouander,
FITZH-E1-P2,32.189

and it is the harder to eate and chowe.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.190

And an other cause is, if drye wether come, it wyll drye and burne vpon
the grounde, and waste away.  FITZH-E1-P2,32.191

Take hede that thy mower mow clene and holde downe the hynder hand of his
sith, that he do not endent the grasse, and to mowe his swathe cleane
thorowe to that that was laste mowen before, that he leaue not a mane
bytwene, and specyallye in the common medowe: FITZH-E1-P2,32.192

for in <P_33> the seuerall medowe it maketh the lesse charge,
FITZH-E1-P2,33.193

and that the moldywarpe-hilles be spredde, and the styckes cleane
pycked out of the medowe in Apryll, or in the beginnynge of Maye.

A Good husbande hath his forkes and rakes made redye in the wynter before
, FITZH-E1-P2,33.199

and they wolde be gotte bytwene Mighelmasse and Martylmasse, and beyked,
and sette euen, to lye vpryght in thy hande: FITZH-E1-P2,33.200

and than they wyll be harde styffe and drye.  FITZH-E1-P2,33.201

And whan the housbande sytteth by the fyre, and hath nothynge to do,
than maye he make theym redye, and tothe the rakes with drye wethywode,
and bore the holes with his wymble, bothe above and vnder, and driue
the tethe vpwarde faste and harde, and than wedge them aboue with drye
woode of oke, FITZH-E1-P2,33.202

for that is hard, FITZH-E1-P2,33.203

and wil driue and neuer come out.  FITZH-E1-P2,33.204

And if he get them in sappe-tyme, all the beykyng and drienge that can
be had shal not make them harde and styffe, FITZH-E1-P2,33.205

but they woll alwaye be plyenge: FITZH-E1-P2,33.206

for they be moste comonly made of hasell and withee, FITZH-E1-P2,33.207

and these be the trees that blome, and specially hasell:
FITZH-E1-P2,33.208

for it begynneth to blome as sone as the lefe is fallen.
FITZH-E1-P2,33.209

And if the rake be made of grene woode, the heed wyll not abyde vppon
the stele, FITZH-E1-P2,33.210

and the tethe wyll fall out, whan he hath mooste nede to them, and let
his warke, and lose moche heye.  FITZH-E1-P2,33.211

And se that thy rake and forke lye vpryghte in thy hand,
FITZH-E1-P2,33.212

downe-warde, than they be not handsome nor easy to worke with.

and if the grasse be very thycke, it woode be shaken with handes, <P_34>
or with a shorte pykforke.  FITZH-E1-P2,34.219

For good teddynge is the chiefe poynte to make good hey,
FITZH-E1-P2,34.220

and than shall it be wyddred all in lyke, or elles not: FITZH-E1-P2,34.221

and whan it is wel wyddred on the ouer syde, and dry, than turne it
cleane before noone, as soone as the dewe is gone: FITZH-E1-P2,34.222

And yf thou dare truste the wether, lette it lye so all nyghte:
FITZH-E1-P2,34.223

and on the nexte daye, tourne it agayne before none, FITZH-E1-P2,34.224

and towarde nyght make it in wyndrowes, and than in smal hey-cockes,
FITZH-E1-P2,34.225

and so to stande one nyghte at the leaste, and sweate: FITZH-E1-P2,34.226

and on the nexte fayre day caste it abrode agayne, FITZH-E1-P2,34.227

and tourne it ones or twyse, FITZH-E1-P2,34.228

and than make it in greatter hey-cockes, and to stande so one nyght or
more, that it maye vngiue and sweate.  FITZH-E1-P2,34.229

For and it sweate not in the hey-cockes, it wyll sweate in the mowe;
FITZH-E1-P2,34.230

and than it wyll be dustye, and not holsome for hors, beastes, nor shepe.
FITZH-E1-P2,34.231

And whan it standeth in the cockes, it is better to lode,
FITZH-E1-P2,34.232

and the more hey maye be loded at a lode, FITZH-E1-P2,34.233

and the faster it wyll lye.  FITZH-E1-P2,34.234

Quyche-hey commeth of a grasse called crofote, FITZH-E1-P2,34.235

and groweth flatte, after the erthe, FITZH-E1-P2,34.236

and bearethe a yelowe floure halfe a yarde hygh and more,
FITZH-E1-P2,34.237

and hath many knottes towarde the roote, FITZH-E1-P2,34.238

and it is the beste hey for horses and beastes, and the sweteste, if it
be well got; FITZH-E1-P2,34.239

but it wyll haue moch more wyddrynge than other hey, FITZH-E1-P2,34.240

for els he wyll be-pysse hym-selfe and waxe hote, and after dustye.
FITZH-E1-P2,34.241

And for to knowe whanne it is wyddred ynoughe, make a lyttell rope of
the same, that ye thinke shulde be moste greneste, FITZH-E1-P2,34.242

and twyne it as harde to-gether bytwen your handes as ye canne,
FITZH-E1-P2,34.243

and soo beynge harde twon, let one take a knyfe, and cut it faste by
your hande; and the knottes wyll be moyste, yf it be not drye ynough.
FITZH-E1-P2,34.244

Shorte hey, and leye-hey, is good for shepe, and all maner of catell,
if it be well got.  FITZH-E1-P2,34.245

A man maye speke of makynge of hey, and gettynge of corne,

To me it is doubtefull, but yet me semeth, they be rather to

FITZH-E1-P2,101.253

The fyrste is prodigalytie in outragious and costely aray, fer aboue

the seconde thynge is costely charge of delycyous meates and drynkes;
FITZH-E1-P2,101.255

the thyrde is outragious playe and game, ferre aboue measure.

Prodigalite in outragious and costely aray.  FITZH-E1-P2,102.261

<$$heading>

I haue seen bokes of accompte of the yomen of the wardropes of noble
men, and also inuentorys made after theyr decease of their apparell,
FITZH-E1-P2,102.263

and I doubte not but at this daye, it is.xx.  tymes more in value
, than it was to suche a man of degre as he was an.C.  yere a-go:
FITZH-E1-P2,102.264

and many tymes it is gyuen away, er it be halfe worne, to a symple
man, the whiche causeth hym to weare the same; and an other symple
man, or a lyttell better, seynge him to weare suche rayment as he,
FITZH-E1-P2,102.265

and so causeth hym to bye suche other, to his great coste and charge,
aboue measure, and an yll ensample to all other: FITZH-E1-P2,102.266

and also to see mens seruantes so abused in theyr aray, theyr cotes be
so syde, that they be fayne to tucke them vp whan they ryde, as women
do theyr kyrtels whan they go to the market or other places, the whiche
is an vnconuenient syght.  FITZH-E1-P2,102.267

And ferthermore, they haue suche pleytes vpon theyr brestes, and
ruffes vppon theyr sleues, aboue theyr elbowes, that yf theyr mayster,
or theym-selfe hadde neuer so greatte nede, they coude not shoote one
shote, to hurte theyr ennemyes, tyll they hadde caste of theyr cotes,
or cut of theyr sleues.  FITZH-E1-P2,102.268

This is fer aboue measure, or common weale of the realme.
FITZH-E1-P2,102.269

This began fyrste with honour, worship, and honesty, FITZH-E1-P2,102.270

and it endeth in pryde, presumption, and pouertye.  Wherof speketh saint
Austin, <font> Quemcunque superbum esse videris, diaboli filium esse ne
dubites: <$$font> That is to say, who-so-euer thou seest that is proude,
dout the not, but he is the diuels chylde.  Wherfore agaynst pryde
he byddeth the remembre: <font> Quid fuisti, quid es, et qualis post
mortem eris: <$$font> That is to say, what thou were, what thou art,
and what thou shalte be after thy death.  FITZH-E1-P2,102.271

And S. Bernarde saythe, <font> Homo nihil aliud est, quam sperma
fetidum, saccus stercorum, et esca vermium: <$$font> That is to saye,
<P_103> A man is nothynge but stynkynge fylthe, a sacke of dounge, and
wormes meate.  The whiche sayinges wolde be remembred, FITZH-E1-P2,103.272

and than me semeth this is sufficient at this time for the first point
of the thre.  FITZH-E1-P2,103.273

152.  FITZH-E1-P2,103.275

Of delycyouse meates and drynkes.  FITZH-E1-P2,103.276

<$$heading>

Howe costely are the charges of delycyous meates & drynkes, that be nowe
most commonly vsed, ouer that it hath ben in tymes paste, and howe fer
aboue measure?  FITZH-E1-P2,103.278

For I haue seen bokes of accompte of householde, and brumentes vpon the
same, FITZH-E1-P2,103.279

& I doubte not, but in delycyous meates, drinkes, and spyces, there is
at this daye foure tymes so moche spent, as was at these dayes, to a
lyke man in degree; FITZH-E1-P2,103.280

and yet at that tyme there was as moche befe and mutton spent as is nowe ,
and as many good housholdes kept, and as many yomenne wayters therin as
be nowe.  FITZH-E1-P2,103.281

This began with loue and charytye whan a lorde, gentylman, or
yoman desyred or prayed an other to come to dyner or soupper,
FITZH-E1-P2,103.282

and bycause of his commynge he wolde haue a dysshe or two mo than he
wolde haue had, if he had ben away.  FITZH-E1-P2,103.283

Than of very loue he, remembrynge howe louyngely he was bydden to dynner ,
and howe well he fared, he thynketh of very kyndnes he muste nedes byd
hym to dyner agayne, FITZH-E1-P2,103.284

and soo ordeyneth for hym as manye maner of suche dysshes and meates,
as the other man dyd, and two or.iii.  mo, FITZH-E1-P2,103.285

& thus by lyttel and litell it is common fer aboue measure.
FITZH-E1-P2,103.286

And begon of loue and charyte, FITZH-E1-P2,103.287

and endeth in pryde and glotony, wherof saynte Ierome saythe: <font>
Qui post carnem ambulant, in ventrem et libidinem proni sunt, quasi
irrationabilia iumenta reputantur.  <$$font> That is to say, They that
walke, and be redy to fulfill the lust of the fleshe and the bely,
are taken as vnreasonable beastes; FITZH-E1-P2,103.288

and sayncte Gregory sayth, <font> Dominante vicio gulae, omnes <P_104>
virtutes per luxuriam et vanam gloriam obruuntur: <$$font> That is to
saye, where the vice of glotony hath domination, all vertues by luxury
and vayne glory are cast vnder: the whiche sayinges wold in lykewise be
remembred; FITZH-E1-P2,104.289

and this me semeth sufficient for the.ii.  poynte of the thre.

<heading>

153.  FITZH-E1-P2,104.292

Of outragious playe and game.  FITZH-E1-P2,104.293

<$$heading>

It is conueniente for euery man, of what degree that he be of, to haue
playe & game accordynge to his degree.  FITZH-E1-P2,104.295

For Cato sayth, <font> Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis: <$$font>
FITZH-E1-P2,104.296

Amonge thy charges and busynes thou muste haue sometyme ioye and myrthe
; FITZH-E1-P2,104.297

but nowe a-dayes it is doone ferre aboue measure.  FITZH-E1-P2,104.298

For nowe a poore man in regarde wyll playe as great game, at all maner
games, as gentylman were wont to do, or greater, and gentilmen as lordes,
and lordes as prynces, FITZH-E1-P2,104.299

& ofte tymes the great estates wyll call gentylmen or yomen to play with
them at as great game as {at} they do, FITZH-E1-P2,104.300

and they call it a disport, the whiche me semeth a very trewe name to
it, FITZH-E1-P2,104.301

for it displeaseth some of them er they departe, and specyall god,
for myspendynge of his goodes and tyme.  FITZH-E1-P2,104.302

But if they played smalle games, that the poore man that playeth myght
beare it thoughe he loste, and bate not his countenaunce, than myght
it be called a good game, a good playe, a good sporte, and a pastyme.
FITZH-E1-P2,104.303

but whan one shall lose vpon a day, or vpon a nyght, as moche money as
wold fynde hym and all his house meate and drynke a moneth or a quarter
of a yere or more, that maye be well called a disporte, or a displeasure
, FITZH-E1-P2,104.304

and ofte tymes, by the meanes therof, it causeth theym to sell theyr
landes, dysheryte the heyres, FITZH-E1-P2,104.305

and may fortune to fall to thefte, robbery, or suche other, to the great
hurte of themselfe, & of theyr chyldren, and to the displeasure of god:
FITZH-E1-P2,104.306

and they so doinge, lyttel do they pondre or regarde the <P_105> saying
of saynt Paule; <font> Iuxta facultates faciendi sunt sumptus, ne longi
temporis victum breuis hora consumat: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,105.307

This play begun with loue and charity, FITZH-E1-P2,105.308

and oft times it endeth with couetous wrath and enuy.  FITZH-E1-P2,105.309

And this me thynketh shoulde be a sufficient instruction for kepynge

A prologue of the thyrde sayinge of the philosopher.  FITZH-E1-P2,105.313

<$$heading>

Nowe thou housbande and housewife, that haue done your diligence and cure
about your husbandrye and huswyfry, accordynge to the fyrste sayenge
of the philosopher, <font> Adhibe curam: <$$font> And also haue well
remembred and fulfylled the seconde sayinge of the sayde philosopher,
<font> Tene mensuram: <$$font> I doubte not but ye be ryche accordyng
to the thyrde sayinge of the sayde philosopher, <font> Et eris diues.
<$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,105.315

Nowe I haue shewed you the sayinge of the philosopher, wherby you
haue goten moche worldely possession, me semeth it were necessary,
to shewe you howe ye maye gette heuenly possessions, accordynge to
the sayenge of our lorde in his gospel, <font> Quid prodest homini,
si vniuersum mundum lucretur, animae vero suae detrimentum paciatur:
<$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,105.316

What profyteth it to a man, thoughe he wyn all the worlde, to the
hyndraunce and losyng of his soule?  FITZH-E1-P2,105.317

Howe be it, it shoulde seme vnconuenient for a temporall man to take vpon
hym to shewe or teache any suche spirytuall matters; FITZH-E1-P2,105.318

and yet there is a great diuersytie betwene predication and doctrine.
FITZH-E1-P2,105.319

<heading>

A diuersitie betwene predication and doctrine.  FITZH-E1-P2,105.321

<$$heading>

As sayncte Iherome saythe, there is greate difference or diuersitie
betwene preachinge and doctrine.  FITZH-E1-P2,105.323

A preachyng or a sermon is, where $is a conuocation or a gatherynge of
people on holye dayes, or other dayes in churches or <P_106> other places,
and times sette and ordeyned for the same.  FITZH-E1-P2,106.324

And it belongeth to theym that be ordeyned there-vnto, and haue
iurisdiction and auctorytie, and to none other.  FITZH-E1-P2,106.325

But euery man may lawefully enforme and teache his brother, or any
other, at euery tyme and place behouable, if it seme expedient to hym ,
FITZH-E1-P2,106.326

for that is an almes-dede, to the whiche euery man is holden & bounde
to do, accordyng to the sayenge of saynt Peter, <font> Vnusquisque ,
sicut accepit gratiam, in alterutrum illam administrare debet.  <$$font>
That is to saye, as euery man hath taken or recyued grace, he oughte to
mynyster and shewe it forthe to other.  FITZH-E1-P2,106.327

For as Chrisostome saythe, great merite is to hym, FITZH-E1-P2,106.328

and a great reward he shall haue in tyme to come, the which writeth or
causeth to be writen, holy doctrine, for that entent, that he may se in
it, howe he may lyue holylye, and that other may haue it, that they maye
be edyfyed or sanctyfyed by the same; FITZH-E1-P2,106.329

for he saythe surely, knowe thou, that howe many soules be saued by the,
soo many rewardes thou shalte haue for eyther.  FITZH-E1-P2,106.330

For saynt Gregory saythe, <font> Nullum sacrificium ita placet deo,
sicut zelus animarum: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,106.331

There is no sacrifyce that pleaseth god so moche, as the loue of soules.
FITZH-E1-P2,106.332

And also he saythe, <font> Ille apud deum maior est in amore, qui ad
eius amorem plurimos trahit: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,106.333

He is greateste in fauour with god, that draweth moste men to the loue
of god.  Wherfore me semeth, it is conuenient to enforme and shewe them,
how they maye gette heuenly possessions.  FITZH-E1-P2,106.334

Than to my purpose, and to the poynt where I lefte,'nowe thou art
ryche. 'FITZH-E1-P2,106.335

What is rychesse.  FITZH-E1-P2,106.337

<$$heading>

It is to be vnderstande what is rychesse; FITZH-E1-P2,106.339

and as me semeth, rychesse is that thynge, that is of goodnes, and $can
$not {TEXT:can-not} be taken awaye from the owner, neyther in his <P_107>
temporall lyfe, nor in the lyfe euerlastynge.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.340

Than these worldly possessions, that I haue spoken of, is no richesse,
for why they be but floures of the worlde.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.341

And that may be wel consydered by Iob, the whiche was the rychest man of
worldely possessions, that was lyuynge in those daies, FITZH-E1-P2,107.342

and sodeynely he was the poorest man agayne that coulde be lyuynge,
FITZH-E1-P2,107.343

and all the whyle he toke pacyence, FITZH-E1-P2,107.344

and was content, as appereth by his sayenge, <font> Dominus dedit,
dominus abstulit: sicut domino placuit, ita factum est, sit nomen domini
benedictum: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,107.345

Our lorde hath gyuen it, FITZH-E1-P2,107.346

our lorde hath taken it awaye, FITZH-E1-P2,107.347

and as it pleaseth our lorde, so be it, FITZH-E1-P2,107.348

blessed be the name of our lorde.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.349

The whiche Iob may be an ensample to euery true chrysten man, of his
pacyence and good liuing in tribulation, as appereth in his storye,
who that lyste to rede therin.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.350

And saynte Austyne saythe: <font> Qui terrenis inhiat, et aeterna non
cogitat, vtrisque in futuro carebit: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,107.351

he that gathereth in worldly thynges, and thynketh not vppon euerlastynge
thynges, shall wante bothe in tyme to come.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.352

For sayncte Ambrose saythe, <font> Non sunt bona hominis, quae secum
ferre non potest: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,107.353

They are not the goodes of man, the whiche he $can $not {TEXT:can-not}
beare with him.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.354

And saynte Bernarde saythe: <font> Si vestra sint, tollite vobiscum:
<$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,107.355

Yf they be yours, take them with you.  FITZH-E1-P2,107.356

Than it is to be vnderstande, what goodes a man shall take with hym.
FITZH-E1-P2,107.357

And these be the good dedes wherof speketh Crysostome: <font> Fac bene,

and worke ryghtwysly, that thou mayste haue truste in god, and that thou

In myne opynyon the propertye of a ryche manne is, to be a purchaser;
FITZH-E1-P2,108.370

and if he wyll purchase, I councell hym to purchase heuen.
FITZH-E1-P2,108.371

For sayncte Austyne saythe, <font> Regnum caelorum nulli clauditur,
nisi illi, qui se excluserit: <$$font> FITZH-E1-P2,108.372

The kyngedome of heuen is to no man closed, but to hym that wyll putte
oute hym-selfe.  Wherfore this texte maye gyue the a courage to prefixe
thy mynde, to make there thy purchase.  FITZH-E1-P2,108.373

And Salomon saythe: <font> Quod mali carius emunt infernum, quam boni

Ill men bye hell derer, thanne the good men bie heuen.
FITZH-E1-P2,108.375

And that me semeth maye well be proued by a common ensample: As if
I had a.M.  shepe to sell, and dyuers men come to me, and bye euery
manne a.C.  of the shepe, all of one price, to paye me at dyuers dayes.
FITZH-E1-P2,108.376

I am agreed, FITZH-E1-P2,108.377

and graunt them these dayes; FITZH-E1-P2,108.378

some of the menne be good, FITZH-E1-P2,108.379

and kepe theyr promesse, FITZH-E1-P2,108.380

and paye me at theyr dayes, FITZH-E1-P2,108.381

and some of theym doo not paye me.  Wherfore I sue theym at the lawe,
FITZH-E1-P2,108.382

and by course of the common lawe, I doo recouer my duetie of them,
FITZH-E1-P2,108.383

and haue theyr bodyes in prisone for execution, tylle they haue made
me payment.  FITZH-E1-P2,108.384

Nowe these men, that haue broken me promesse, and payed not theyr
dewetye, bye theyr shepe derer thanne the good menne bought theyrs.
FITZH-E1-P2,108.385

For they haue imprysonment of theyr bodyes, FITZH-E1-P2,108.386

and yet must they pay theyr duetyes neuer the lesse, or elles lye and
dye there in pryson: the whiche sheepe be derer to them, then to the
good men that kepte theyr promes.  FITZH-E1-P2,108.387

Righte so euery man chepeth heuen, FITZH-E1-P2,108.388

and god hath sette on it a pryce, and graunted it to euery man, and
giuen to them dayes of payment: FITZH-E1-P2,108.389

the pryce is all one, FITZH-E1-P2,108.390

and that is to kepe his commaundementes, and fulfyll theyr promesse,
and haue heuen at theyr decease.  FITZH-E1-P2,108.391

The yll men breake promesse, FITZH-E1-P2,108.392

& kepe not his commaundementes, wherfore at theyr <P_109> decease they be
put in pryson, that is to say in hell, there to abyde his ryghtuousenes.
FITZH-E1-P2,109.393

And soo the yll men bye hell derer, than the good menne bye heuen.
FITZH-E1-P2,109.394

And therfore it is better, to forgoo a lyttel pleasure, or suffer a
lyttell payne in this worlde, than to suffer a moche greatter and a
