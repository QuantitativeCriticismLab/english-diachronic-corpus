Phara~ a~d Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Disahab 2.xii.  dayes iurney
from Horeb vnto Cades bernea, by the waye that leadeth unto mount Seir.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.6

3 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.7

And it fortuned the first daye of the.xi.  moneth in the fortieth yere ,
that Moses spake vnto the childern {COM:sic} of Israel acordinge vnto
all that the Lorde had geuen him in commaundment vnto them, 4 after that
he had smote Sihon the kynge of the Amorites which dwelt in Hesbon, and
Og kynge of Basan which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.8

5 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.9

On the other syde Iordayne in the londe of Moab, Moses begane to declare
this lawe saynge: 6 the Lorde oure God spake vnto vs in Horeb sayenge:
7 Ye haue dwelt longe ynough in this mount: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.10

, Isaac and Iacob, to geue vnto them and their seed after them.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.17

9 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.18

And I sayde vnto yov {COM:sic} the same season: I am not able to bere
you myselfe alone.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.19

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.20

For the Lorde youre God hath multiplyed you: so that ye are this daye
as the starres of heauen in numbre TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.21

charge and stryffe that is amonge you: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.26

13 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.27

brynge therfore men of wisdome and of vnderstondinge and expert
knowne amonge youre trybes, that I maye make them ruelars ouer you.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.28

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.29

And ye answered me TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.30

and sayed: that which thou hast spoken is good to be done.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.31

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.32

And then I toke the heedes of youre trybes, men of wysdome and that were
expert, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.33

and made them ruelers ouer you: captaynes ouer thousandes and ouer
hundredes ouer fyftye and ouer ten, and officers amonge youre trybes.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.34

16 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.35

And I charged youre Iudges the same tyme sayenge: heare youre brethern
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.36

and iudge righteously betwene euery man and his brother and the straunger
that is with him.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.37

17 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.38

Se that ye knowe no man in Iudgement: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.39

but heare the small as well as the greate TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.40

and be afrayed of no man, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.41

for the lawe is Gods.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.42

And the cause that is to harde for you, brynge vnto me and I will

18 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.44

And I commaunded you the same season, all the thinges which ye shulde doo.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.45

19 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.46

And then we departed from Horeb TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.47

and walked thorow all that greate and terreble wildernesse as ye haue
sene alonge by the waye that ledeth vnto the hilles of the Amorites,
as the Lorde oure God commaunded us, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.48

and came to Cades bernea.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,1D.49

<P_1,20D>

20 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.51

And there I sayed vnto you: Ye are come vnto the hilles of the Amorites,
which the Lorde oure God doth geue vnto us.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.52

21 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.53

Beholde the Lorde thi God hath sett the londe before the,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.54

goo vpp TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.55

and conquere it, as the Lorde God of thy fathers sayeth vnto the: feare

nether be discoraged.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.57

22 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.58

And then ye came vnto me euery one TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.59

and sayed: Let us sende men before us, to serche us out the londe and
to brynge us worde agayne, both what waye we shall goo vpp by, and vnto
what cities we shall come.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.60

23 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.61

And the sayenge pleassed me well TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.62

and I toke.xii men of you, of euery trybe one.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.63

24 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.64

And they departed TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.65

and went vp in to the hye contre TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.66

and came vnto the ryuer Escoll, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.67

and serched it out, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.68

25 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.69

and toke of the frute of the londe in their hondes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.70

and brought it doune vnto us TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.71

and brought us worde agayne TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.72

and sayde: it is a good lande which the Lorde oure God doeth geue us.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.73

26 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.74

Notwithstondinge ye wolde not consente to goo vpp, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.75

but were dishobedient vnto the mouth of the Lorde youre God,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.76

27 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.77

a~d murmured in youre tentes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.78

and sayde: because the Lorde hateth us, therfore he hath brought us out
of the londe of Egipte, to delyuer us in to the handes of the Amorites
and to destroye us.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.79

28 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.80

How shall we goo vpp?  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.81

Oure brethern haue discoraged oure hartes sayenge: the people is greater
and taller than we, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.82

a~d the cities are greatte and walled euen vpp to heauen,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.83

and moreouer we haue sene the sonnes of the Enakimes there.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.84

29 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.85

And I sayed vnto you: dreade not TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.86

nor be afrayed of the~: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.87

30 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.88

The Lorde youre God which goeth before you, he shall fyghte for you,
acordynge to all that he dyd vnto you in Egipte before youre eies 31 a~d
in the wildernesse: as thou hast sene how that the Lorde thy God bare
the as a man shulde beare his sonne, thorow out all the waye which ye
haue gone, vntill ye came vnto this place.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.89

32 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.90

And yet for all this sayenge ye dyd not beleue the Lorde youre God 33
which goeth the waye before you, to serche you out a place to pitche
youre tentes in, in fyre by nyght, that ye myghte se what waye to go
and in a cloude by daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.91

34 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.92

And the Lorde herde the voyce of youre wordes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.93

and was wroth TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.94

and swore sayenge, 35 there shall not one of these men of this frowarde
generation se that good londe which I sware to geue vnto youre fathers,
36 saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.95

he shall se it, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.96

and to him I will geue the londe which he hath walked in a~d
to his childern, because he hath contynually folowed the Lorde.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.97

37 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.98

Likewise the Lorde was angrye with me for youre sakes sayenge: thou also
shalt not go in thither.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.99

38 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.100

But Iosua the so~ne of Nun which stondeth before the, he shall go
in thither.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.101

Bolde him therfore TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.102

for he shall deuyde it vnto Israel.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.103

39 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.104

Moreouer youre childern which ye sayed shulde be a praye, and youre
sonnes which knowe nether good nor bad this daye, they shall goo in
thither TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.105

a~d vnto them I will geue it, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.106

a~d they shall enioye it.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,20D.107

<P_1,40D>

40 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.109

But as for you, turne backe TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.110

and take youre iurneye in to the wildernesse: euen the waye to the
reed see.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.111

41 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.112

Than ye answered TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.113

and sayed vnto me: We haue synned agenst the Lorde:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.114

we will goo vp and fyghte, acordinge to all that the Lorde oure God
co~maunded us.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.115

And whe~ ye had gyrde on euery man his wepons of warre and were ready
to goo vp in to the hilles, 42 the Lorde sayed vnto me: saye vnto the~,
se that ye go not vp and that ye fighte not, for I am not amo~ge you:
lest ye be plaged before youre enemies.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.116

43 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.117

And whe~ I told you ye wold not heare: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.118

but disobeyed the mouth of the Lorde, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.119

and went presumptously vp in to the hilles.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.120

44 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.121

The~ the Amorites which dwelt in those hilles, came out agenst you
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.122

and chased you as bees doo, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.123

and hewed you in Seir, eue~ vnto Horma.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.124

45 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.125

And ye came agayne TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.126

and wepte before the Lorde: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.127

but the Lorde wolde not heare youre voyce nor geue you audience.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.128

46 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,1,40D.129

And so ye abode in Cades alo~ge season, acordinge vnto the tyme that ye

THE.II.  CHAPTER.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.133

<$$heading>

1 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.135

Then we turned TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.136

and toke oure iurney in to the wildernesse, euen the waye to the red
see as the Lord co~maunded me.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.137

And we compassed the mountayns of Seir a lo~ge tyme TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.138

2 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.139

The~ the Lorde spake vnto me saienge: 3 Ye haue co~passed this mountayns
{COM:sic} lo~ge ynough, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.140

turne you northwarde.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.141

4 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.142

And warne the people sayenge: Ye shall goo thorow the costes of youre
brethern the childern of Esau which dwell in Seir, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.143

and they $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} afrayed of you: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.144

5 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.145

But take good hede vnto youre selues that ye prouoke the~ not,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.146

for I wil not geue you of their lo~de, no not so moch as a fote
breadeth: because I haue geue~ mount Seir vnto Esau to possesse.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.147

6 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.148

Ye shall bye meate of the~ for money to eate, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.149

and ye shall bye water of the~ for money to dri~ke.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.150

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.151

For the Lorde thy God hath blessed the in all the workes of thine ha~de
, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.152

a~d knew the as thou we~test thorow this greate wildernesse.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.153

Moreouer the Lorde thi God hath bene with the this.xl.  yeres, so that
thou hast lacked nothinge.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.154

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.155

And whe~ we were departed from oure brethern the childern of Esau which
dwelt in Seir by the felde waye from Elath a~d Ezion Gaber, we turned
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.156

a~d went the waye to the wildernesse of Moab.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.157

9 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.158

The~ the Lorde sayed vnto me se that thou vexe not the Moabites,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.159

nether prouoke the~ to batayle TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.160

for I will not geue the of their lo~de to possesse: because I haue geue~
Ar vnto the childern of loth to possesse.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.161

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.162

The Emimes dwelt there $in {TEXT:in_in} tymes past, a people greate,
many a~d tal, as the Enakimes: 11 which also were take~ for geantes as
the Enakimes: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.163

And the Moabites called the~ Emymes.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.164

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.165

In like maner the Horimes dwelt in Seir before time which the childern
of Esau cast out, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.166

a~d destroyed the~ before them TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.167

and dwelt there in their stede: as Israel dyd in the londe of his
possessio~ which the Lorde gaue them TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.168

13 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.169

Now ryse vpp <paren> sayed I <$$paren> TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.170

a~d get you ouer the ryuer Zared: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.171

a~d we went ouer the ryuer Zared.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.172

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.173

The space in which we came from Cades bernea vntill we were come ouer
the ryuer Zared was.xxxviii.  yeres: vntill all the generacion of the
men of warre were wasted out of the host as the Lorde sware vnto the~.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.174

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.175

For in dede the hande of the Lorde was age~st the~, to destroye them
out of the host, till they were consumed.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.176

16 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.177

And as soone as all the men of warre were consumed and deed from amonge
the people, 17 then the Lorde spake vnto me sayenge.  18 Thou shalt goo
thorow Ar the coste of Moab this daye, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.178

19 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.179

and shalt come nye vnto the childern of Ammon: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.180

se that thou vexe them not, nor yet prouoke them.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.181

For I will not geue the of the londe of the childern of Ammon to
possesse , because I haue geuen it vnto the childern of loth to possesse.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,1D.182

<P_2,20D>

20 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.184

That also was taken for a londe of geauntes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.185

and geauntes dwelt therin in olde tyme, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.186

and the Ammonites called them Zamzumyms.  21 A people that was great,
many and taule, as the Enakyms.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.187

But the Lorde destroyed them before the Ammonites, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.188

and they cast them out TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.189

and they dwelt there i~ their steade: 22 as he dyd for the childern of
Esau which dwell in Seir: eue~ as he destroyed the horyms before them,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.190

a~d they cast them out TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.191

and dwell in their steade vnto this daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.192

23 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.193

And the Avims which dwelt in Hazarim eue~ vnto Aza, the Caphthoryms
which came out of Caphthor destroyed them TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.194

and dwelt in their rowmes.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.195

24 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.196

Ryse vp, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.197

take youre yourney TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.198

and goo ouer the ryuer Arnon.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.199

Beholde, I haue geuen in to thy ha~d Siho~ the Amorite kynge of Hesbo~
, a~d his londe.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.200

Goo to TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.201

and conquere TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.202

and prouoke hi~ to batayle.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.203

25 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.204

This daye I will begynne to send the feare and dreade of the vppon
all nacions that are vnder al portes of heauen: so that whe~ they
heare speake of the, they shall tremble and quake for feare of the.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.205

26 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.206

Then I sent messengers out of the wildernesse of kedemoth vnto Syhon kynge
of Hesbon, with wordes of peace saynge: 27 Let me goo thorow thy londe.
I will goo allweyes alonge by the hye waye TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.207

and will nether turne vnto the righte hande nor to the left.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.208

28 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.209

Sell me meate for money for to eate, and geue me drinke for money for
to drynke: I will goo thorowe by fote only 29 <paren> as the childern
of Esau dyd vnto me whiche dwell in Seir and the Moabites whiche dwell
in Ar <$$paren> vntyll I be come ouer Iordayne, in to the londe which
the Lorde oure God geueth vs.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.210

30 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.211

But Sihon the kinge of Hesbon wolde not let vs passe by him,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.212

for the Lord thy God had hardened his sprite and made his herte tough
because he wold delyuer him into thy hondes as it is come to passe
this daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.213

31 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.214

And the Lorde sayed vnto me: beholde, I haue begonne to set Sihon and
his londe before the: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.215

goo to TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.216

and conquere, that thou mayst possesse his londe.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.217

32 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.218

Then both Sihon and all his people came out agenst vs vnto batayle
at Iahab.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.219

33 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.220

And the Lorde set him before vs, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.221

and we smote hym and his sonnes and all hys people.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.222

34 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.223

And we toke all his cities the same season, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.224

and destroyed all the cities with men, wemen, and childern
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.225

a~d let nothinge remayne, 35 saue the catell only we caught vnto oure
selues and the spoyle of the cities which we toke, 36 from Aroer vppon
the brynke off the riuer off Arnon, and the citie in the ryuer, vnto
Gilead: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.226

there was not one citye to stronge for vs.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.227

The Lorde oure God delyuered all vnto vs: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.228

37 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,2,20D.229

only vnto the londe of the childern of Ammon ye came not, nor vnto all
the coste of the riuer Iabock nor vnto the cities in the mountaynes, nor

THE.III.  CHAPTER.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.233

<$$heading>

1 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.235

Then we turned TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.236

and went vpp the waye to Basan.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.237

And Og the kinge of Basan came out agenst vs: both he and all his people
to batayle at Edrey.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.238

2 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.239

And the Lorde sayed vnto me: feare him not, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.240

for I haue delyuered him and all his people a~d his lande in to thy
hande TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.241

a~d thou shalt deale with hi~ as thou dealest with Sihon kynge of the
Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.242

3 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.243

And so the Lorde oure God delyuered in to oure handes, Og also the kynge
off Basan and al his folke, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.244

And we smote him vntyll noughte was left him.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.245

4 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.246

And we toke all his cities the same ceason <paren> for there was
not a citie whiche we toke not from them <$$paren> euen iii.
score cities, all the region of Argob, the kyngdome of Og in Basan.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.247

5 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.248

All these cities were made stronge with hye walles, gates and barres,
besyde vnwalled townes a greate maynye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.249

6 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.250

And we vtterly destroyed them, as we played with Sihon kynge off
Hesbon : bringing to nought al the cities with men, wemen and childern.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.251

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.252

But all the catell and the spoyle of the cities, we caughte for oure
selues.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.253

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.254

And thus we toke the same ceason, the lo~de out of the hande of two
kynges of the Amorites on the other syde Iordayne, from the ryuer of
Arnon vnto mount Hermon 9 <paren> which Hermon the Sidons call Sirion ,
but the Amorites call it Senyr <$$paren> 10 all the cities in the playne
a~d all Gilead and all Basan vnto Salcha and Edrei, cities of the kingdome
of Og in Basan.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.255

11 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.256

For only Og kynge of Basan remayned of the remnau~t of the geauntes:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.257

beholde, his yernen bed is yet at Rabath amonge the childern off Ammo~
.ix.  cubettes longe a~d,.iiii.  cubetes brode, of the cubettes of a man.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.258

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.259

And when we had conquered this londe the same tyme, I gaue from Aroer
which is apon the riuer of Arnon, and halfe mount Gilead and the cities
thereof vnto the Rubenites, and Gadites.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.260

13 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.261

And the rest of Gilead and all Basan the kingdome of Og, I gaue vnto
the halfe trybe of Manasse: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.262

all the regio~ of Argob with all Basan was called the londe of geauntes.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.263

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.264

Iair the sonne of Manasse toke all the region of Argob vnto the costes
of Gesuri a~d Maachati, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.265

and called the townes of Basan after his owne name: the townes of Iair
vnto thys daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.266

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.267

And I gaue half Gilead vnto Machir.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.268

16 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.269

And vnto Ruben a~d Gad, I gaue from Gilead vnto the ryuer of Arnon a~d
half the valey a~d the coste, eue~ vnto the ryuer Iabock which is the
border of the childern of Ammon, 17 and the feldes a~d Iordayne with
the coste, from Cenereth even vnto the see in the felde which is the
salt see vnder the sprynges off Pisga eastwarde.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.270

18 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.271

And I commaunded you the same tyme <paren> ye Ruben a~d Gad <$$paren>
sayeng: the Lorde your God hath geuen you this londe to enioye it:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.272

se that ye go harnessed before youre brethern the childern of Israel,
all that are me~ of warre amonge you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.273

19 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,1D.274

Youre wyues only youre childern a~d youre catell <paren> for I wote
that ye haue moch catell <$$paren> shall abyde in youre cities which
I haue geuen you, <P_3,20D> 20 vntyll the Lorde haue geue~ rest vnto
your brethern as well as vnto you, and vntyll they also haue conquered
the londe which the Lorde youre God hath geuen them beyond Iordayne:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.275

and then returne agayne euery ma~ vnto his possession which I haue
geue~ you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.276

21 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.277

And I warned Iosua the same tyme sayeng thyne eyes haue sene all that the
Lorde youre God hath done vnto these two kynges, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.278

eue~ so the Lorde will doo vnto all kyngdomes whither thou goest.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.279

22 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.280

Feare them not, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.281

for the Lorde youre God he it is that fighteth for you.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.282

23 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.283

And I besoughte the Lorde the same tyme sayenge: 24 O lorde Iehoua,
thou hast begonne to shewe thy servaunte thy greatnesse and thy mightie
hande TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.284

for there is no God in heauen nor in erth that can do after thy workes
and after thy power: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.285

25 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.286

let me goo ouer a~d se the good londe that is beyonde Iordayne, that
goodly hye contre and Libanon.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.287

26 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.288

But the Lorde was angrie with me for youre sakes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.289

and wolde not heare me, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.290

but sayed vnto me, be content, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.291

and speake henceforth no moare vnto me of this matter,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.292

27 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.293

Get the vp in to the toppe of Pisga TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.294

a~d lifte vpp thyne eyes west, north, south a~d easte,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.295

a~d beholde it with thyne eyes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.296

for thou shalt not goo ouer this Iordayne.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.297

28 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.298

Moreouer, charge Iosua TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.299

and corage him TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.300

and bolde him.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.301

For he shall go ouer before his people, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.302

and he shall deuyde the londe which thou shalt se vnto them.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,3,20D.303

And now herken Israel vnto the ordinaunces a~d lawes which I teache you,

the Lorde God of youre fathers geueth you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.311

Ye shall put nothinge vnto the worde which I commaunde you nether doo

youre God which I commaunde you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.313

3 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.314

Youre eyes haue sene what the Lorde dyd vnto Baal Peor:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.315

for al the men that folowed Baal Peor, the Lorde youre God hath destroyed

But ye that claue vnto the Lorde youre God, are alyue euery one of you

Beholde, I haue taught you ordinaunces and lawes, soche as the Lorde

Kepe them therfore TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.322

and doo them, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.323

for that is youre wisdome and vnderstandynge in the syghte of the
nacyons: whiche when they haue herde all these ordinaunces, shall
saye: O what a wyse and vnderstondynge people is this greate nacion.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.324

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.325

For what nacyon is so greate that hath Goddes so nye vnto hym: as the
Lorde oure God is nye vnto vs, in all thinges, when we call vnto hym?
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.326

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.327

Yee, and what nacyon is so greate that hath ordinaunces and lawes
so ryghtuousse, as all thys lawe which I sett before you this daye.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.328

9 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.329

Take hede to thy selfe therfore only TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.330

a~d kepe thy soule diligently, that thou forgett not the thinges which
thyne eyes haue sene and that they departe not out of thyne harte,
all the dayes of thine life: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.331

but teach them thy sonnes, a~d thy sonnes sonnes.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.332

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.333

The daye that I stode before the Lorde youre god in Horeb, whe~ he
sayed vnto me, gather me the people together, that I maye make them
heare my wordes that they maye lerne to fere me as longe as thei lyue
vppon the erth and that they maye teache their childern: 11 ye came

a~d there was darcknesse, clowdes a~d myst.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.337

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.338

And the Lorde spake vnto you out of the fire TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.339

a~d ye herde the voyce of the wordes: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.340

But sawe no ymage, saue herde a voyce only, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.341

13 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.342

And he declared vnto you his couenaunt, which he commaunded you to doo,
euen.x.  verses TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.343

and wrote them in two tables of stone.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.344

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.345

And the Lorde commaunded me the same season to teache you ordynaunces
and lawes, for to doo them in the londe whether ye goo to possesse it
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.346

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,1D.347

Take hede vnto youre selues diligently as pertayninge vnto youre soules
, for ye sawe no maner of ymage the daye when the Lorde spake vnto you
in Horeb out of the fire: 16 lest ye marre youre selues and make you
grauen ymages after what soeuer likenesse it be: 17 whether after the
likenesse of ma~ or woma~ or any maner beest that is on the erth or of
any maner fetherred foule that fleth in the ayre, or of any maner worme

Ye and leste thou lyfte vpp thyne eyes vnto heuen, and when thou seyst

heauen, shuldest be disceaued and shuldest bow thi selfe vnto them a~d

<P_4,20D>

20 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.352

For the Lorde toke you TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.353

and broughte you out of the yernen fornace of Egipte, to be vnto
him a people of enheritaunce, as it is come to passe this daye.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.354

21 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.355

Forthermoare, the Lorde was angrye with me for youre sakes
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.356

and sware, that I shulde not goo ouer Iordane and that I shulde not
goo vnto that good londe, which the Lorde thy God geueth $the {TEXT:te}
to enherytaunce.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.357

22 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.358

For I must dye in this londe, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.359

and shall not goo ouer Iordane: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.360

But ye shall goo ouer and conquere that good londe TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.361

23 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.362

Take hede vnto youre selues therfore, that ye forgett not the appoyntment
of the Lorde youre God which he made with you, and that ye make you no
grauen ymage of whatsoeuer it be that the Lorde thi God hath forbidden
the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.363

24 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.364

For the Lorde thi God is a co~suminge fyre, and a gelouse God.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.365

25 Yf after thou hast gotten childern and childerns childern and
hast dwelt longe in the londe, ye shall marre youre selues and make
grauen ymages after the liknesse of what so euer it be, and shall worke
wekednesse in the syghte of the Lorde thy God, to prouoke him.  26 I call
heauen and erth to recorde vnto you this daye, that ye shall shortely
peressh from of the londe whether ye goo ouer Iordayne to possesse it:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.366

Ye shall not prolonge youre dayes therin, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.367

but shall shortly be destroyed.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.368

27 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.369

And the Lorde shall scater you amonge nacions, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.370

and ye $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} lefte few in numbre amonge the people
whother {COM:sic} the Lorde shall brynge you: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.371

28 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.372

and there ye shall serue goddes which are the workes of mans hande,
wod and stone which nether se nor heare $nor {TEXT:not} eate nor smell.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.373

29 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.374

Neuer the later ye shall seke the Lorde youre God euen there,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.375

and shalt fynde him yf thou seke him with all thine herte and with all
thy soule.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.376

30 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.377

In thi tribulacion and when all these thinges are come apon the,
euen in the later dayes, thou shalt turne vnto the Lorde thy God,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.378

and shalt herken vnto his voyce TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.379

31 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.380

For the Lorde thy God is a pitiefull God: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.381

he will not forsake the nether destroye the, nor forgett the appoyntme~t
made with thy fathers which he sware vnto them.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.382

32 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.383

For axe I praye the of the dayes that are past which were before the,
sence the daye that God created man vppon the erth and from the one syde
of heauen vnto the other whether any thinge hath bene lyke vnto this
greate thinge or whether any soche thinge hath bene herde as it is,
33 that a nacion hath herde the voyce of God speakinge out of fyre as
thou hast herde, and yet lyued?  34 ether whether God assayed to goo and
take him a people from amonge nacions, thorow temptacions and sygnes and
wonders and thorow warre and with a mightie hande and a stretched out arme
and wyth myghtye terreble fightes, acordynge vnto all that the Lorde youre
God dyd vnto you in Egipte before youre eyes.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.384

35 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.385

Vnto the it was shewed, that thou myghtest knowe, how that the Lorde he
is God and that there is none but he.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.386

36 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.387

Out of heauen he made the heare his voyce to nurter the,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.388

and vppon erth he shewed the his greate fyre, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.389

and thou hardest his wordes out of the fyre.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.390

37 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.391

And because he loued thy fathers, therfore he chose their seed after
them TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.392

and broughte the out with his presence and with his myghtye power of
Egipte: 38 to thrust out nations greater a~d myghtyer then thou before
the, to bringe the in and to geue the their londe to enheritaunce:
as it is come to passe this daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.393

39 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.394

Vnderstonde therfore this daye TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.395

and turne it to thine herte, that the Lorde he is God
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.396

in heauen aboue and vppon the erth beneth there is no moo:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,20D.397

<P_4,40D>

kepe therfore his ordynaunces, and his commaundmentes which I commaunde
the this daye, that it maye goo well with the and with thi childern
after the and that thou mayst prolonge thy dayes vppon the erth, which
the Lorde thi God geueth the foreuer.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,40D.400

41 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,40D.401

Then Moses seuered.iii.  cities on the other syde Iordane towarde the
sonne rysynge, 42 that he shulde fle thiter {COM:sic} which had kylled
his neyghboure vnwares and hated him not in tyme past and therfore

TYNDOLD-E1-P2,4,40D.402

and these are the witnesse, ordinaunces and statutes which Moses tolde

The Lorde oure God made an appoyntment with us in Horeb.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.417

The Lorde made not this bonde with oure fathers, but with us:

And I stode betwene the Lorde and you the same tyme, to shewe you the

For ye were afrayed of the fyre TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.425

and therfore went not vpp in to the mount TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.426

and he sayed.  6 I am the Lorde thy God which brought the out of the

Thou shalt haue therefore none other goddes in my presence.

TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.431

9 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.432

Thou shalt nether bowe thy self vnto them nor serue them,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.433

for I the Lorde thy God, am a gelouse God, visettinge the wikednesse
of the fathers vppon the childern, euen in the thyrde and the fourth
generation, amonge them that hate me: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.434

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.435

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vayne:

for the Lorde will not holde him giltlesse, that taketh his name in vayne.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.439

Kepe the Sabbath daye that thou sanctifie it, as the Lorde thy God hath

Syxe dayes thou shalt laboure and doo all that thou hast to doo,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.443

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.444

but the seuenth daye is the Sabbath of the Lorde thy God:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.445

thou shalt doo no maner worke, nether thou nor thy sonne nor thy doughter
nor thy seruaunte nor thy mayde nor thine oxe nor thyne asse nor any of
thi catell nor the straunger that is within thy cytye, that thy seruaunte
and thy mayde maye rest as well as thou.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.446

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.447

And remembre that thou wast a seruaunte in the londe of Egypte and how
that the Lorde God, brought the out thence with a myghtye hande and a
stretched out arme.  For which cause the Lorde thy God commaundeth the
to kepe the Sabbath daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,1D.448

Honoure thi father and thi mother, as the Lord thi God hath co~mau~ded
the: that thou mayst prolonge thi dayes, and that it maye go well with the

Thou shalt not beare false witnesse agenst thy neghboure,

These wordes the Lorde spake vnto al youre multitude in the
mount out of the fyre, cloude and darcknesse, with a loude voyce
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,20D.464

For what is any flesh that he shulde heare the voyce of the lyuynge

And the Lorde herde the voyce of youre wordes when ye spake vnto me,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,5,20D.481

Whe~ the Lorde thy God hath brought the in to the lond whither thou goest
to possesse it, and hath cast out manye nacions before the: the Hethites,
the Girgosites, the Amorites, the Cananites, the Pheresites, the Heuites

3 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.552

Also thou shalt make no mariages with them, nether geue thy doughter vnto
his sonne nor take his doughter vnto thy sonne.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.553

4 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.554

For they will make youre sonnes departe fro me and serue straunge Goddes

and then will the wrath off the Lorde waxe whote vppon you a~d destroye
you shortely.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.556

a~d burne their ymages with fyre.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.562

For thou art an holy nacion vnto the Lorde thy God TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.564

the Lorde thy God hath chosen the to be a seuerall people vnto him silf
of all nacions that are vppon the erth.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.565

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.566

It was not because of the multitude of you aboue all nacions, that the
Lorde had lust vnto you and chose you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.567

For ye were fewest of all nacions: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.568

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.569

But because the Lorde loued you and because he wolde kepe the othe which

his commaundmentes, euen thorowe out a thousande generacions 10 and
rewardeth them that hate him before his face so that he bringeth them

will reward him before his face.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.573

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.576

Yf ye shall herken vnto these lawes a~d shall obserue and do them, then

swore vnto thy fathers 13 and will loue the, blesse the and multiplye
the: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,7,1D.577

he will blesse the frute of thy wombe and the frute of thi felde, thy

Thou shalt bringe to nought all nacions which the Lorde thy God delyuereth

a~d se that thou couet not the syluer or golde that is on them nor take

Brynge not therfore the abhominaycon to thyne housse, lest thou be a

TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.631

4 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.632

Thy rayment waxed not olde vppon the, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.633

nether dyd thy fete swell thys xl. yere.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.634

5 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.635

Vnderstonde therfore in thine herte, that as a man nurtereth his sonne,
euen so the Lorde thy God nurtereth the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.636

6 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.637

Kepe therfore the commaundmentes of the Lorde thy God that thou walke
in his wayes and that thou feare him TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.638

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.639

For the Lorde thy God bringeth the in to a good lande, a londe of riuers
of water, of fou~tens and of springes that springe out both in valayes
and hylles: 8 a londe of whete and of barly, of vynes, figtrees and
pomgranates, a lond of olyuetrees with oyle and of honye : 9 a lande
wherin thou shalt not eate bred in scarcenesse, and where thou shalt
lacke nothinge, a londe whose stones are yerne, and out of whose hylles
thou shalt dygge brasse.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.640

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.641

When thou hast eaten therfore and filled thy selfe, then blesse the Lord
for the good lond which he hath geuen the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.642

11 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.643

But bewarre that thou forgett not the Lorde thy God, that thou woldest
not kepe his co~maundmentes, lawes and ordinaunces which I commaunde
the this daye: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.644

yee 12 and when thou hast eate~ a~d filled thy selfe a~d hast bylt goodly
housses a~d dwelt therin, 13 a~d when thy beesse a~d thy shepe are waxed
manye a~d thy syluer a~d thy golde is multiplied a~d all that thou hast
encreased, 14 then bewarre lest thine herte ryse a~d thou forgett the
Lorde thy God which brought the out of the londe of Egipte the housse
of bondage, 15 a~d which led the in the wildernesse both greate a~d
terreble with firye serpentes a~d scorpio~s a~d thurste where was no
water which brought the water out of the rocke of flynt: 16 whiche fed
the in the wildernesse with Man where of thy fathers knewe not, for to
humble the and to proue the, that he might doo the good at thy later ende.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.645

17 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.646

And beware that thou saye not in thine herte, my power and the might of
myne awne ha~de hath done me all these actes: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.647

18 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.648

But remembre the Lorde thy God, how that it is he which gaue the power
to do ma~fully, for to make good the promesse which he sware vnto thy
fathers, as it is come to passe this daye, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.649

19 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.650

For yf thou shalt forget the Lorde thy god and shalt walke after straunge
goddes and serue them and worsheppe them, I testyfye vnto you this daye,
that ye shall surely perysh.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,1D.651

<P_8,20D>

20 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,8,20D.653

As the nacyons whiche the Lorde destroyeth before the, euen so ye shall
peryshe, because ye wolde not herken vnto the voyce of the Lord youre God.

THE.IX.  CHAPTER.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.657

<$$heading>

1 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.659

Heare Israel, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.660

thou goest ouer Iordayne this daye, to goo and conquere nations greater
and mightier than thy selfe: and cities greate a~d walled vp to heauen,
2 a~d people greate and tall, euen the childern of the Enakims, which
thou knowest and of whom thou hast herde saye who is able to stond before
the childern of Enack?  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.661

3 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.662

But vnderstonde this daye that the Lorde thy God which goeth ouer before
the a consumyng fire, he shall destroye them and he shall subdue them
before the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.663

And thou shalt cast them out, and brynge them to noughte quyckely as
the Lorde hath sayed vnto the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.664

4 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.665

Speake not in thyne hert, after that the Lorde thy God hath cast them
out before the sayenge: for my rightuousnes the Lorde hath brought me
in to possesse this lo~de.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.666

Nay, but for the wekednesse of these nacio~s the Lord doth cast the~
out before the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.667

5 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.668

It is not for thi rightuousnes sake a~d right hert that thou goest to
possesse their lo~d: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.669

But partely for the wekednesse of these nacio~s, the Lord thy god
doth cast the~ out before the, and partly to performe that which
the Lorde thy God sware vnto thi fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Iacob.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.670

6 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.671

Vnderstond therfore that it is not for thy rightuousnes sake, that
the Lorde thy God doth geue the this good lond to possesse it,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.672

for thou art a stiffenecked people.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.673

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.674

Reme~bre a~d forget not how thou prouokedest the Lorde thi god in the
wildernesse: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.675

for sens the daye that thou camest out of the lond of Egipte
vntyll ye came vnto this place, ye haue rebelled agenst the Lorde.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.676

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.677

Also in Horeb ye angred the Lorde so that the Lorde was wroth with you,
eue~ to haue destroyed you, 9 after that I was gone vpp in to the mount,
to sett the tables of stone, the tables of appoyntment which the Lorde
made with you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.678

And I abode in the hyll.xl.  dayes a~d.xl.  nightes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.679

and nether ate bred TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.680

nor dranke water.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.681

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.682

And the Lorde delyuered me two tables of stone writen with the finger
of God, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.683

and in them was acordynge to all the wordes which the Lorde sayed
vnto you in the mount out of the fire in the daye whe~ the people were
gathered together.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.684

11 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.685

And whe~ the.xl.  dayes and.xl.  nyghtes were ended, the Lorde
gaue me: the two tables off stone, the tables of the testament,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.686

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.687

and sayed vnto me: Vpp, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.688

and get the doune quyckely from hence, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.689

for thy people which thou hast broughte out of Egipte, haue marred
themselues.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.690

They are turned attonce out of the waye, whiche I commaunded them,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.691

and haue made the~ a god of metall.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.692

13 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.693

Furthermore the Lorde spake vnto me sayenge: I se this people how that
it is a stiffenecked people, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.694

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.695

let me alone that I maye destroye them and put out the name off them
from vnder heauen, and I will make off the a nacion both greater a~d
moo than they.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.696

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.697

And I turned awaye TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.698

and came doune from the hyll TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.699

<paren> and the hyll burnt with fire <$$paren> TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.700

and had the two tables of the appoyntment in my handes.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.701

16 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.702

And when I loked and sawe that ye had synned agenst the Lorde youre
God and had made you a calfe of metall and had turned attonce out of
the waye whiche the Lorde had commaunded you.  17 The~ I toke the two
tables TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.703

and cast them out of my two handes, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.704

and brake the~ before youre eyes.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.705

18 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.706

And I fell before the Lorde: euen as at the first tyme.xl.  dayes a~d .xl.
nightes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.707

and nether ate bred TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.708

nor dranke water ouer all youre synnes whiche ye had synned in
doynge wekedly in the syght of the Lorde a~d in prouokinge him.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.709

19 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.710

For I was afrayed of the wrath and fearsnesse wherwith the Lord was
angrie with you, eue~ for to haue destroyed you TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.711

But the Lorde herde my peticion at that tyme also.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,1D.712

<P_9,20D>

20 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.714

The Lorde was very angrie with Aaron also, eue~ for to haue destroyed
him: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.715

But I made intercession for Aaro~ also the same tyme.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.716

21 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.717

And I toke youre synne, the calfe which ye had made
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.718

a~d burnt him with fire TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.719

a~d stampe him TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.720

and grounde him a good, eue~ unto smal dust.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.721

And I cast the dust thereof in to the broke that descended out of
the mount.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.722

22 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.723

Also at Thabeera and at Masa and at the sepulchres of lust ye angred
the Lorde, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.724

23 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.725

yee a~d when the Lorde sent you from Cades Bernea sayenge: goo vpp and
conquere the lond whiche I haue geuen you, ye disobeyed the mouth of
the Lorde youre God, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.726

and nether beleued hi~ TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.727

nor herkened vnto his voyce.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.728

24 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.729

Thus ye haue bene disobedie~t vnto the Lord, sence the daye that I
knew you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.730

25 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.731

And I fell before the Lorde.xl.  dayes and.xl.  nightes whiche I laye
there, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.732

for the Lorde was minded to haue destroyed you.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.733

26 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.734

But I made intercession vnto the Lorde TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.735

and sayed: O Lorde Iehoua, destroye not thy people and thyne enheritau~ce
which thou hast delyuered thorow thi greatnesse and which thou hast
brought out of Egipte with a mightie hand.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.736

Reme~bre thy servauntes Abraham, Isaac and Iacob TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.737

and loke not vnto the stoburnesse of this people nor vnto their wekednesse
and synne: 28 lest the londe whence thou broughtest them saye: Because
the Lorde was not able to brynge them in to the londe which he promysed
them and because he hated them, therfore he caried them out to destroye
them in the wildernesse.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.738

29 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,9,20D.739

Moreouer they are thy people and thine enheritaunce, whiche thou
broughtest out with thy myghtye power and wyth thy stretched out arme.

THE.X.  $CHAPTER {TEXT:Chapte}.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.743

<$$heading>

In the same ceason the Lord sayed vnto me hewe the two tables of stone
like vnto the first and come vp vnto me in to the mount a~d make the an
Arke of wod, 2 and I will wryte in the table, the wordes that were in
the first tables which thou brakest, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.745

3 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.746

a~d thou shalt put the~ in the~ arcke.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.747

And I made an arke of sethi wod TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.748

a~d hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.749

a~d went vp in to the mountayne TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.750

and the ii. tables in myne hande.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.751

4 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.752

And he wrote in the tables, acording to the first writinge <paren> the.x.
verses whiche the Lorde spake vnto you in the mount out of the fire in
the daye when the people were gathered <$$paren> TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.753

a~d gaue the~ vnto me.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.754

5 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.755

And I departed TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.756

a~d came doune fro~ the hyll TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.757

and put the tables in the arcke which I had made: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.758

a~d there they remayned, as the Lorde commaunded me
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.759

6 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.760

And the childern of Israel toke their iurney from Beroth Be~ Iake~ to
Mosera, where Aaro~ dyed a~d where he was buried, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.761

a~d Eleazer his sonne became preast i~ his steade.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.762

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.763

And fro~ the~ce they departed vnto Gudgod: a~d fro~ Gudgod to Iathbath,
a lo~d of riuers of water.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.764

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.765

And the same ceason the Lorde separated the trybe of Leui to beare the
arcke of the appoyntment of the Lorde and to stonde before the Lorde,
a~d to ministre vnto him and to blesse in his name vnto this daye.
9 Wherfore the Leuites haue no parte nor enheritaunce with their brethern.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.766

The Lorde he is their enheritaunce, as the Lorde thy God hath promysed
them.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.767

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.768

And I taried in the mount, eue~ as at the first tyme xl. dayes
and.xl.  nyghtes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.769

and the Lorde herkened vnto me at that tyme also, so that the Lorde
wolde not destroye the.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.770

11 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.771

And the Lorde sayed vnto me: vpp TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.772

a~d goo forth in the iurney before the people TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.773

and let them goo in a~d conquere the lond which I sware vnto their
fathers to geue vnto them.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.774

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.775

And now Israel what is it that the Lord thi God requyreth of the, but to
feare the Lord thi God and to walke in all his wayes and to loue him and
to serue the Lorde thy God with all thyne herte and with all thy soule,
13 that thou kepe the commaundmentes of the Lorde a~d his ordinaunces
which I commaunde the this daye, for thy welth.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.776

14 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.777

Beholde, heauen and the heauen of heauens is the Lordes thy god, and
the erth with all that therein is: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.778

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.779

only the Lorde had a lust vnto thy fathers to loue them,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.780

and therfore chose you theire seed after them off all nacyons, as it is
come to passe this daye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.781

16 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.782

Circumcyse therfore the foreskynne of youre hartes,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.783

17 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.784

and be no longer stiffnecked.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.785

For the Lorde youre God, he is God of goddes and lorde of lordes, a greate
God, a myghtye and a terreble 18 which regardeth no mans person nor taketh
giftes: which but doeth right vnto the fatherlesse and wedowe and loueth
the straunger, to geue him fode and rayment.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.786

19 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.787

Loue therefore the straunger, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.788

for ye were straungers youre selues in the londe of Egipte.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,1D.789

<P_10,20D>

20 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,20D.791

Thou shalt feare the Lorde thi God and serue him and cleaue vnto him
a~d swere by his name, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,20D.792

21 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,20D.793

for he is thi prayse TYNDOLD-E1-P2,10,20D.794

Thi fathers went doune in to Egipte with.Lxx soules,

THE XI. CHAPTER.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.801

<$$heading>

1 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.803

Loue the Lorde thi God TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.804

and kepe his obseruaunces, his ordinaunces, his lawes and his
commaundmentes alwaye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.805

2 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.806

And call to mynde this daye that which youre childern haue nether knowen
nor sene: euen the nurture of the Lorde youre God, his greatnesse, his
myghtye hande and his stretched out arme: 3 his miracles and his actes
which he dyd amonge the Egiptia~s, euen vnto Pharao the kinge off Egipte
and vnto all his lo~de: 4 a~d what he dyd vnto the host of the Egiptia~s,
vnto their horses a~d charettes, how he brought the water of the red see
vppon the~ as they chased you, and how the Lorde hath brought them to
nought vnto this daye: 5 a~d what he dyd vnto you in the wildernesse
vntill ye came vnto this place: 6 a~d what he dyd vnto Dathan and
Abiram the sonnes of Eliab the sonne of Ruben, how the erth opened hir
mouth a~d swalowed the~ with their housholdes and their tentes, a~d all
their substa~ce that was in their possessio~ , in the myddes of Israel.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.807

7 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.808

For youre eyes haue sene all the greate deades of the Lorde which he dyd.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.809

8 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.810

Kepe therfore al the co~maundmentes which I co~maunde the this daye
that ye maye be stronge a~d goo and conquere the londe whother ye go to
possesse it, 9 a~d that ye maye prolonge youre dayes in the londe which
the Lorde sware vnto youre fathers to geue vnto them a~d to their seed,
a londe that floweth with mylke and honye.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.811

10 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.812

For the londe whother thou goest to possesse it, is not as the londe of
Egipte whence thou camest out, where thou sowedest thi seed and waterdest
it with thi laboure as a garden of herbes: TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.813

11 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.814

but the londe whither ye goo ouer to possesse it, is a londe of hilles
and valeyes TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.815

and drynketh water of the rayne of heaue~, TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.816

12 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.817

and a londe which the Lorde thi God careth for.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.818

The eyes of the Lord thi God are always apo~ it, from the begynnynge of
the yere vnto the later ende of the yere.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.819

13 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.820

Yf thou shalt herken therfore vnto my commaundementes which I commaunde
you this daye, that ye loue the Lorde youre God and serue him with all
youre hertes and with all youre soules: 14 then he will geue rayne
vnto youre londe in due season, both the fyrst rayne and the later,
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.821

and thou shalt gather in thy corne, thy wyne and thyne oyle.
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.822

15 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.823

And he will sende grasse in thy feldes for thy catell:
TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.824

and thou shalt eate and fyll thy selfe.  TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.825

16 TYNDOLD-E1-P2,11,1D.826

But bewarre that youre hertes disceaue you not that ye turne asyde and
serue straunge goddes and worshepe them, 17 and the~ the wrath of the
Lorde waxe hote vpon you a~d shott vp the heauen that there be no rayne
