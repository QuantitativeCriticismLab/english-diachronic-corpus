<heading:edcomment:TO_HIS_FATHER>

Sir, I am vncerteyne of your being at Harling GAWDY-E2-P2,45.3

neverthelesse I have adventured to directe my lettres to yow, In
whose absence I wishe my good Brother might have the pervsing of them.
GAWDY-E2-P2,45.4

And as neare as I can I will acquaint yow with such newes as hathe
happened and such business as hath passed my hands.  GAWDY-E2-P2,45.5

And first for the discharge which my mother desired to have from the
Coferer and the rest of the officers.  I was with them all my self
severally, GAWDY-E2-P2,45.6

bothe by intreaty and persuasion I used the best meanes I colde.
GAWDY-E2-P2,45.7

I was with them all together at the counting howse.  GAWDY-E2-P2,45.8

They seemed to be wondrous willing to pleasure me so farr as they might
, GAWDY-E2-P2,45.9

But this is certeyne that they neither do, nor will graunt to any of
what sort soever the lyke manner of discharge.  GAWDY-E2-P2,45.10

And hearinge my mothers name nominated, they sayde it was the only <P_46>
thing that was directed against all the officers.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.11

Yet with as much frendshipp as I mought well request at ther hands,
they have taken specyall order by name that none shall meddle with any
of your men that dwell at Tolson.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.12

And indeade I thincke you shall not neade muche to feare the purveyors,
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.13

for ther is a specyall bill past against them in the parlament house.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.14

And that hathe muche nettled all the officers of the grene clothe.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.15

For your bill of impost I have it ready, more than {COM:?} that he was
not in towne, whose hand is very requisite shold be added to the bill.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.16

The last Sonday being at the court I will describe a salutation that
passed betwixt M=r= Lovell and my self touching yow, and in very truthe,
and as neare as I may in the very same wordes.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.17

I was talking with my L. Wharton, and M=r= Dacres of the Northe.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.18

M=r= Lovell standing a good pretty way from vs, cam GAWDY-E2-P2,46.19

and whispered in M=r= Dacres eare, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.20

and sodenly and very softly he speake in my eare to this effecte without
any other salutation, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.21

and my self and he hath had no speeches since our least meeting at Walton.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.22

But now to the purpose GAWDY-E2-P2,46.23

this was his speches very abruptly, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.24

Yo=r= father will nowe leave his slaunderous speeches of me,
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.25

and presently runn his way without suffering me to reply.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.26

I followed him as fast as I might, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.27

and told him that my father had neither sayde or done any thing, but
that he wold iustefy to be honest, and in his absence I wold iustefy it
to be true to his face wher he wold disprove me.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.28

Well sayth he, he hathe vsed very spiteful and slaunderous speeches
touching my creditt.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.29

Then I desired to know what the effecte of the woordes shold be;
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.30

he answered that he wold keepe them to him self, and yow shold heareafter
heare of them; GAWDY-E2-P2,46.31

then I replyed that I toke it for a lye and him for a lyar in the
reporting of it, and not mayntayning it.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.32

Well cosin saythe he I have nothing to say to yow, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.33

this matter concerneth your father my great enemy.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.34

And he shall answer it els wher, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.35

and yf I be not muche abused by my friends I know it to be very true.
GAWDY-E2-P2,46.36

I vrged him farr to have had some knowledge therof, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.37

but he passed it over GAWDY-E2-P2,46.38

and called me cosin, GAWDY-E2-P2,46.39

and by no meanes I cold make him angry with me.  GAWDY-E2-P2,46.40

He told me <P_47> that I did the parte of a sonne in the behalf of a
father GAWDY-E2-P2,47.41

and in conclusion told me that within fewe dayes I shold vnderstand the
whole circumstance therof, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.42

but as yet I have no vnderstanding therof: GAWDY-E2-P2,47.43

and so I must leave it till I heare further therof, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.44

and then yow shall have notice therof accordingly.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.45

But assure yow S=r= I gather this of his vilde condition, that Malice
was his mother, and envy nursed him, and shame brought him into the world
and never will forsake him till he leave world and all.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.46

I speake not altogether of the spleane, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.47

for the truthe leadeth me to say muche more.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.48

He that hewethe at the Body of the tree intendeth the destructione of
the braunches, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.49

and the lyfe of the one preservethe the creditt of the other.
GAWDY-E2-P2,47.50

If I have spent to many wordes about him that is not worthe one good word,
I am to crave pardon for the same, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.51

somtymes a faulte escapes the printer, vsuall with moste writers.
GAWDY-E2-P2,47.52

S=r= Frances Drake and his company went as yesterday being Wedensday to
their shippes.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.53

My L. of Worster departed out of this life the laste weeke.
GAWDY-E2-P2,47.54

My l. of Worster is deade, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.55

and yet my l. of Worster liveth.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.56

S=r= William Winter hathe taken his leave of all his frendes in this
present world, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.57

and amongst all theise great men an old acquaintance of my brothers
and myne hathe taken the same course, and I hope sayled to heaven,
GAWDY-E2-P2,47.58

Tom Carrew, he was an honest man w=ch= makes me remember him amongst
his betters.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.59

...  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.60

Let my affectionate duty be rememberd to yowr good self in all dutyfull
manner, GAWDY-E2-P2,47.61

my humble duty to my good $mother for whom I will not forget to do
any service.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.62

To my oncle Anthony Gavdy, to my loving Sisters, wishing yow all and my
self abundance of the favor of the most mighty.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.63

From London GAWDY-E2-P2,47.64

this xxvij of ffebruary {COM:1589}.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.65

My returne shall be before the end of the Parlament GAWDY-E2-P2,47.66

for it is thought it will hold long.  GAWDY-E2-P2,47.67

<heading:edcomment:TO_HIS_FATHER>

Sir,...  The parlament is lyke to continew very long, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.70

and the end therof is not lyke shortly to fall out.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.71

It is thought it shall be but proroged.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.72

The minister of Kenninghall was with me aboute some truble he is brought
into, by reason of woordes, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.73

he brought me a letter from yow that by my means he might fynde some
favor.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.74

I spake to M=r= Vycechamberlyne for him GAWDY-E2-P2,48.75

and he had referred him to M=r= Wade.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.76

I talked with M=r= Wade about him, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.77

And he had posted him over to My L. of Canterbury,
GAWDY-E2-P2,48.78

and further I have not yet heard of him, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.79

but assure yow, Sir, I will not fayle to do him any pleasure in respecte
of the place he cam last from.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.80

I sent last week a frayle of fygges, reysons and allmons.
GAWDY-E2-P2,48.81

I heare my oncle Anthony is at Graves End GAWDY-E2-P2,48.82

and further I heard not from him, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.83

he attendethe vppon his Mistress a thing vsual amongst all good servants.
GAWDY-E2-P2,48.84

Myne owne experience hathe taught me, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.85

I have bene a servant and had a Mistress.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.86

And I ever found that the greater {was} the service, the greater was
the reward.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.87

His desert is great, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.88

his favor shall be answerable therto.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.89

I wish I might have sene him, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.90

and whensoever, I desire to be especially commended to him.
GAWDY-E2-P2,48.91

Ther is very freshe newes and very trewe that there was a warrant made
to acuse my L. of Arundell, GAWDY-E2-P2,48.92

and I thinke he is indyted and is lyke to communicate further by degrees.
GAWDY-E2-P2,48.93

I am sorry his deserts shold now clayme for justice.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.94

I wish he had had better regard of himself.  GAWDY-E2-P2,48.95

His oncle and my L. William are restrained of ther liberty.
GAWDY-E2-P2,48.96

I mean to come so spedely to yow that I will referr the certeynty of
all other newes to myne own <P_49> reporting.  GAWDY-E2-P2,49.97
