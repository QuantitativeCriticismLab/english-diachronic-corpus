Deare mother I have better considered of my brother Knightli's letter,
which is very hard to reade, he writing so bad a hand, MASHAM-E2-P2,104.4

but I perseve ther is not soe great a differanc between Sir Robert and
us as I thought ther had bin.  MASHAM-E2-P2,104.5

Jug is desirus to keep hir owne land, tho she have the less joynter,
MASHAM-E2-P2,104.6

and I think hir owne inheritanc $will $be {TEXT:willbe} better for hir
preferment in a second match, if God should take away hir husband withowt
iswe, than her joynter.  MASHAM-E2-P2,104.7

Sir Robert ofers 300 maintinans and so much joynter aded to hir owne
if she oute live hir husband and have isswe by him, other wayes not,
which I se no reson for, because he shall injoye hir land for his life.
MASHAM-E2-P2,104.8

I dout not but my brother Knightly will prevaile with Sir Robert to
yeald to our resonable demaunds.  MASHAM-E2-P2,104.9

I have writ to him MASHAM-E2-P2,104.10

and when I here his answer you shall know more.  MASHAM-E2-P2,104.11

I hope God will dispose all for the best.  MASHAM-E2-P2,104.12

Thus with my humble duty praying for the continuanc of your health,
especialy for the thriving of your sole, hoping ere long to se you,
I remaine Your obedient daughter Elizabeth Masham MASHAM-E2-P2,104.13

I desir to have my kind love remembred to my brother and sisters and
the rest of my frinds.  MASHAM-E2-P2,104.14

Jug Altham in this watye busines, wherin I would be loth to doe anything
withowt your advice and aprobation: MASHAM-E2-P2,120.44

I conffes the man moveth me much to aprove of it, MASHAM-E2-P2,120.45

but I know God comandes me to have a care in the second place of the
outward conveniencis; MASHAM-E2-P2,120.46

tho I desier to acsept of much less with such a man, yet I $shall $be
{TEXT:shallbe} much taxed of hir friends if I look not for a compedency
of owtward estate.  MASHAM-E2-P2,120.47

But Sir Nathanell Rich tolde me he thought Mr Saint Jhons colde
not spend less then 500=li= yearly him self now he is a single man,
MASHAM-E2-P2,120.51

if that be soe then hir estate $will $be {TEXT:willbe} but little to pay
howsrent and maintaine howskeeping if thay keep any, or elc to sogiorn
in another bodie's howse.  MASHAM-E2-P2,120.52

place, MASHAM-E2-P2,120.55

and then God gives leav to seek other things as may be fitt to make our
pasadg the more comfortable to that place whare we shall have no need
