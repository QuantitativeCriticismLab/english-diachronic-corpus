Hit may like your good Grace to be advertised that I have this nyght ,
after the Kings Grace had souped, presented and redde un to his Highnes as
well your Graces Lettre wrytten un to me dated Yesterday, as the Lettres
of the Quene of Scotts wrytten to my lord of Surrey, with the Lettres
of his Lordishippe, as well answeryng her Grace as advertising yours.
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.12

The Kings Highnes is glad that my Lord of Surrey now bygynneth savourely
to perceve that the lords of Scotland entend but onely to dreve over
the tyme of theyre annoyaunce; MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.13

and mych would his Grace have bene gladder that my Lord had savored hit
before, MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.14

for than his Grace thinketh that as well the feat that shall now be done,
or is by this done, myght have bene long synnys done, and peradventur
mych more.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.15

His Highnes also lyketh not all the beste that my Lord of Surrey in his
lettre wrytten to the Quene which he wold she shold shew to the lords
of Scottland appointeth theym the tyme and place where they shall send
to hym to Gedworth, MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.16

for his Grace thinketh the tyme and place so certaynly knowen it $shall
$be {TEXT:shalbe} a good occasion to the Scotts the more surely to
withstand his entreprise.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.17

How be it his Grace trusteth in God hit $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe} or is
by this tyme well inough.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,212.18

<P_1.1,213>

His Highnes is very sory of the plage, and the ferfent agues fallen
in his army to the great minishing of the same; for the remedy and
reinforcing wherof his Highnes thinketh no thinge more profitable than
for the causes in your Grace's Lettres moost prudently remembred, that
the places of them that are departed to God, or sent bakke to Calais to
be cured, shold be, and so is he content they $shall $be {TEXT:shalbe}
supplied with as many horsemen of those parties.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,213.20

And thereof his Grace requyreth Yours that my lord of Suffolke may
be advertised.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,213.21

Finally that hit lyketh your good Grace so benygnely to accepte and take
in worth my pore service, and so far above my merits to commend the
same in that Lettre which of myn accustumed maner your Grace foreknew
the Kings Grace shold se; wherby his Highnes shold have occasion to
accepte hit in lyke wise, and so lyked your Grace in one Lettre both
geve me your thanks and gete me his.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,213.22

<P_1.1,253>

Hit may lyke your good Grace to be advertised that yisternyght at my
cummyng un to the Kings Graces presence, after that I had made your Graces
recommendations and his Highnes shewed hym selfe very greatly glad and
joyfull of your Graces helthe, as I was abowte to declare ferther to his
Grace what lettres I had brought, his Highnes, perceiving Lettres in my
hand, prevented me ere I could bygyn, and saied"Ah ye have lettres nowe
by John Joachym, MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.31

and I trow sum resolution what they will do. "MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.32

"Nay veryly Sir"quoth I"My lord hath yit no word by John Joachim
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.33

nor John Joachim as far as my Lord knew had yit no worde hym
selfe this day in the mornyng whan I departed from his Grace. "
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.34

"No had"quoth he, I mych mervaile therof, MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.35

for John Joachim had a servaunt come to hym two dayes agoo. "
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.36

"Sir,"quoth I,"if hit lyke your Grace, this mornyng my Lords Grace had
no thing herd therof; MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.37

for yisterday his Grace at after {COM:sic} none dispeched me to your
Grace with a Lettre sent from Mr Doctor Knyght, MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.38

and the same nyght late, his Grace sent a servaunt of his to myn howse
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,253.39

and commaunded me to be with his Grace this mornyng by eight of the clokke
, where at my cummyng <P_1.1,254> he delivered me these other lettres and
advertisements sent un to hym fro Mr Pace commanding me that after that
your Highnes had seene theym I shold remitte theym to hym with diligence,
as well for that he wold shew theym to other of your Graces counsaile,
as also to John Joachym, MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.40

for the contents be such as will do hym litle pleasure. "
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.41

"Mary"quoth his Grace"I am well a paied therof," MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.42

and so he fell in meryly to the redyng of the Lettres of Maister
Pace, and all the other abstracts and wrytyngs wherof the contents
as highly contented hym as eny tidings that I have sene cum to hym;
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.43

and thanked your Grace moost hartely for your good and spedy advertisement
; MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.44

and furthwithe he declared the newes and every materiall point which
vppon the reding his Grace well noted un to the Quenys Grace and all other
abowt hym, who were mervelouse glad to here it.  MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.45

And the Quenys Grace saied that she was glad that the Spanyerds had yit
done somwhat in Italy in recompence of their departure owt of Province.
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.46

I shewed his Highnes that your Grace thought that the French King passed
the mountaignys in hope to wynne all with a visage in Italy, and to fynd
there no resistence: MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.47

and his sodayn cummyng uppon mych abashed the cuntrees, putting eche
quarter in dowt of other and owt of suertie who myght be well trusted;
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,254.48

but now sith he fyndeth it otherwise, myssyng the helpe of money which
he hoped to have had in Mylleyn; fyndyng his <P_1.1,255> enemyes strong,
and the fortressis well manned and furnyshed; MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,255.49

and at Pavia, by th'expugnation wherof he thought to put all the remanant
in fere and drede, being now twyes rejected w=t= losse and reproche, his
estimation shall so decay, and his friends fail, his enemyes confermed
and encoraged, namely such aide of th'Almaignes of new joynyng with theym
that lyke as the French King byfore wrote and bosted un to his mother
that he had of his awne mynd passed in to Italy, so is it lykly that she
shall have shortly cause to wryte agayn to hym that it had be mych bettre
and more wisedome for hym to abide at home than to put hym selfe there,
where as he standeth in great parell whither ever he shall gete thense.
MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,255.50

The King's Grace lawghed MOREWOL-E1-P2,1.1,255.51

and said that he thinketh it $will $be {TEXT:wilbe} very hard for
hym to gete thense.  And that he thinketh the maters going thus,
the Popis Holynes will not be hasty neither in Peace nor Treuix.
