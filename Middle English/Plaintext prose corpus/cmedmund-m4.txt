The moder hirself weryd the hard heyre for oure Lordis loue
CMEDMUND-M4,164.24

CMEDMUND-M4,164.37

CMEDMUND-M4,164.38

And then Seynt Edmond encresyd so gretely in vertu that every

CMEDMUND-M4,164.39

<P_165>

And in a daye as his felowys and he wente to playe he left his felowship
CMEDMUND-M4,165.41

and went allone into a medowe vnder an hedge saying his devocions.
CMEDMUND-M4,165.42

And sodenly there appierid before hym a fayre chelde in whyte clothyng
CMEDMUND-M4,165.43

and sayd:'Hayle, felowe that goyst allone. 'CMEDMUND-M4,165.44

And than Edmounde merveylid from whens the chylde come; CMEDMUND-M4,165.45

and the chelde sayde:'Edmond, knowyst not me? 'CMEDMUND-M4,165.46

He sayde:'Naye! 'CMEDMUND-M4,165.47

And he sayde:'I am thye felowe in scole, CMEDMUND-M4,165.48

and in eche other place where that thu goyst I am alweye on thy ryght

and yet thu knowyst me not.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.50

But loke thu in my forehed and there thu shalte fynde my name wryte.
'CMEDMUND-M4,165.51

<paren> And than Edmond lokyd in his forehed CMEDMUND-M4,165.52

and se wryte therein Jesus nazarenus, rex Judeorum, fili Dei, miserere

And then the chelde saide:'Drede the not, Edmond, CMEDMUND-M4,165.54

for I am thy lorde, Jesu Cryste, CMEDMUND-M4,165.55

and shall be thye defendoure whyle thue leuest. 'CMEDMUND-M4,165.56

And than Edmond fylle downe mekely CMEDMUND-M4,165.57

and thankyd our Lorde of his grete mercy and godenes.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.58

And oure Lorde bade hym when he shall go to his bed and when he shall

affore-wryten in mynde of hys passhyon, CMEDMUND-M4,165.59

'and the deuyll shall haue no power ouer the'.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.60

And anone the chylde vanysshyd awaye, CMEDMUND-M4,165.61

and Seynt Edmond vsyd euer after that prayer and blessyng to his lyvys

and suffryd euer grete penaunce for Goddis sake in weryng of the heyre.
CMEDMUND-M4,165.63

And when he had contynued many yeris at Paryce at the scole, than he
came to Oxford.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.64

And he dyd neuer lechery CMEDMUND-M4,165.65

nor consentyd yerto, CMEDMUND-M4,165.66

and that was special grace of oure Lorde.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.67

And on a daye he came to an ymage of oure Lady CMEDMUND-M4,165.68

and put a ryng vpon hir fyngur CMEDMUND-M4,165.69

and he promysed hyr verely neuer to haue other wyff but hir whyles
he levyd.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.70

And he greete oure Lady withe these iiii wordis:'Aue, Maria, gracia
Plena', which was wryte in the ryng.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.71

Hys oste had a doughter that labouryd gretely Seynt Edmond to synne by
hir CMEDMUND-M4,165.72

and she desyred long tyme to come to his chambir.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.73

And at the last this holye man grauntyd hir.  CMEDMUND-M4,165.74

And she was ryght gladde CMEDMUND-M4,165.75

and spyed hir tyme CMEDMUND-M4,165.76

and came <P_166> to his chambir CMEDMUND-M4,166.77

and made hir redy to go to bed CMEDMUND-M4,166.78

and stode nakyd before Seynt Edmond.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.79

And he toke a sherp rodde CMEDMUND-M4,166.80

and layde vpon the mayde tyll the rede blode ranne downe fro hir body
in euery syde.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.81

And than he sayde to hyr:'Thus thu shalt lerne to caste awaye thye sowle
for the fowle lustis of thye bodye. 'CMEDMUND-M4,166.82

And ar he lefte of she had no lust to syn with hym CMEDMUND-M4,166.83

for all hir fowle desyres were clene gonne.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.84

And after that she levyd a clene virgyn to hir lyves ende.
CMEDMUND-M4,166.85

Than sone after Mabely his swete moder nyghed hir ende CMEDMUND-M4,166.86

and sente for Seynt Edmond hir sonne CMEDMUND-M4,166.87

and yeaff hym hir blessyng and all hir chyldren.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.88

And than she prayed hym for Goddes loue and oure Ladys also that he wolde
se that hys susters were well guyded in the nonry of Catysby affore-sayde.
CMEDMUND-M4,166.89

And so she passid to our Lorde full of vertues, CMEDMUND-M4,166.90

and is buryed in the churche of Seynt Nycholas at Abyngdon in a tombe
of marbyll before the rode.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.91

And this scripture is wryte on hir tombe: CMEDMUND-M4,166.92

'Hir lyeth Maboly, flowre of wedows. 'CMEDMUND-M4,166.93

And than Seynt Edmonde made a chapell at Catysby, CMEDMUND-M4,166.94

and after bothe his susters were buryed therein, CMEDMUND-M4,166.95

for the one of theym was pryoras of the same nonry CMEDMUND-M4,166.96

and dyd there many myraclys.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.97

And theye ben buryed before the high auter in the same nonry.
CMEDMUND-M4,166.98

And than this holy man Seynt Edmond dwellyd at Oxford CMEDMUND-M4,166.99

and contynued there in ful holy leuyng CMEDMUND-M4,166.100

for he weryd the hard heyre knett with knottes lyke a nett.
CMEDMUND-M4,166.101

And the knottis stekyd faste to his flessh that oftyntymes it causid
his body to blede and to be full sore.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.102

And in this maner was bothe hys shurte and hys breche imade,
CMEDMUND-M4,166.103

and he bounde it faste with a corde to hys body that the heyre myght
cleve fast to his body in euery place.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.104

Hyt sate so strayte vpon hym that vnnethe he myght bowe his body, the
which was a ful grete penaunce to hym.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.105

And in a tyme whan his shurte of heyre was fowle and tobroke, he toke
it his man too brenne in a grete fyre.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.106

But he cowde not brenne hem in no wyse, CMEDMUND-M4,166.107

but euer thaye laye hole and vnbrent in the fyre.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.108

Than his mann toke an hevy stone CMEDMUND-M4,166.109

and bownde the shurte thereto CMEDMUND-M4,166.110

and caste it in the water where was a depe ponde; CMEDMUND-M4,166.111

and there he left theym.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.112

But he tolde hys maister that thaye were brente.  CMEDMUND-M4,166.113

<P_167>

Seynt Edmond and his felowys on a daye came fro Lewkenowre to Abyngdon
CMEDMUND-M4,167.115

and as thaye came into a grete valey thaye se many black fowlys lyke
crowys, among which there sate one that was all totoryn with the other
black crowys; CMEDMUND-M4,167.116

and thaye cast hym from one to another that it was grete pety to
beholde it.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.117

Therefore his felowys were nye madde for fere of that syght.
CMEDMUND-M4,167.118

And then Seynt Edmond comfortyd hem CMEDMUND-M4,167.119

and tolde theym whate it was.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.120

He saide that thaye beth feendis of helle that berith a mannys sowle
that dyed at the towne of Chalfegrove right nowe, CMEDMUND-M4,167.121

and that sowle shall neuer come in the blysse of heuyn for his cursyd
leuyng.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.122

And than Seynt Edmond and his felowis wente to the towne of Chalfegrove
CMEDMUND-M4,167.123

and fownde al thyng lyke as Seynt Edmond tolde theym.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.124

And fro thens thaye wente too Abyngdon CMEDMUND-M4,167.125

and theire Seynt Edmond wente into the churche CMEDMUND-M4,167.126

and sayde his prayers lyke as he was wonte to doo, the which prayer was O
intemerata, the which he sayde euery daye in the wurship of Jesu Criste,
oure blessyd Lady, and of Seynt John the Euaungelyst.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.127

And this prayer he vsyd to saye dayly or he dyd one wordely workys.
CMEDMUND-M4,167.128

But in a tyme he forgate to saye this holy oryson CMEDMUND-M4,167.129

and than Seynt John the Euaungelyst came to Seynt Edmond in a ful gastfull
maner CMEDMUND-M4,167.130

and blamyd gretely Seynt Edmond.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.131

But after that to his lyfys ende he neuer forgate to saye that holy
prayer.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.132

And after this holy man encresyd so gretely in Oxforde in all the vii
sciences that all men had grete joye of hym.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.133

And in a nyght as he sate in his studye, hys awne moder Maboly appierid
vnto hym in a vysyon.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.134

And she sayde to hir sonne:'Loke fro hense forewarde that thue laboure
in devynyte and in no nother science, CMEDMUND-M4,167.135

for that is the wylle of God lyke as he hathe sente the worde by me.
'CMEDMUND-M4,167.136

This saide she vanyshed awaye fro hym.  CMEDMUND-M4,167.137

And after that this holy mann labourid <P_168> alweye in devynyte to
fulfylle the wylle of oure Lorde Jesu Cryst.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.138

And he encresyd so mervelously in that scyence that al Oxford had grete
wondyr of hym for his grete connyng, CMEDMUND-M4,168.139

for there was none lyke hym in all Oxford.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.140

ffor he had that grace when he radde in the scole of devynyte, he profyted
more to the herers in one weke than other mennys techyng dyd in a moneth,
CMEDMUND-M4,168.141

for many one of his scolers thurgh his gracious techyng forsoke the
worlde CMEDMUND-M4,168.142

and became relygious men.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.143

And in a daye as the holy man sate in the scole for to dispute of the
holy trynyte, he came long ar his scolers came, CMEDMUND-M4,168.144

and he felle in a sclombryng as he sate on his chayre.
CMEDMUND-M4,168.145

And ther came a white dove CMEDMUND-M4,168.146

and brought hym the body of oure Lorde CMEDMUND-M4,168.147

and he put hyt into his mouthe.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.148

And than the dove flye vpwarde from hym CMEDMUND-M4,168.149

and heuyn openyd ayenst hym as Seynt Edmonde behelde hit.
CMEDMUND-M4,168.150

And euer after he thought that the savoure of oure Lordis flessh was
euer in hys mowthe.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.151

And thereby he knewe full moche privyte of the pure state of Jesu Cryste
and of hys magestye in hevyn, CMEDMUND-M4,168.152

for he had mervelouse connyng aboue al other doctors that were in Oxforde
CMEDMUND-M4,168.153

for he expownyd so hye maters to theym that they thought he was more
lyke an angel than a man.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.154

And in euery lesson that this holy man taught he thought in oure Lordis
passhyon.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.155

And in a nyght he studyed so long on his bokys that sodenly he fylle
aslepe and forgate to blesse hym and thynke on the passhyon of oure Lorde.
CMEDMUND-M4,168.156

And than the feende that had gret envy to hym laye so hevye on Seynt
Edmond that he had no power to blesse hym with the ryght honde ner with
the lyft honde.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.157

And than Seynt Edmond wyst not whate to doo, CMEDMUND-M4,168.158

but at last thurgh the grace of oure Lorde he remembryd his blessyd
passhyon; CMEDMUND-M4,168.159

and then the feend had no power ouer Seynt Edmond, CMEDMUND-M4,168.160

but fylle downe anone fro hym.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.161

And than Seynt Edmond commaundid hym by the vertue of oure Lordis passhion
that he shulde telle hym howe he shulde best defende hym that he shulde
haue no power ouer hym.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.162

And the feende aunsweryd to Seynt Edmond:'That that thue haste sayde
and thought on the passhyon of oure Lorde Jesu Cryst; CMEDMUND-M4,168.163

ffor whate mann or womann that hath hys mende on oure Lordis passhyon,
I have no power ouer theym at no tyme. 'CMEDMUND-M4,168.164

And euer after Seynt Edmond the holy mann had ful grete deuocyoun in
the passhyon of oure Lorde and in holy orysons CMEDMUND-M4,168.165

for therein was all hys delyte bothe nyght and daye.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.166

But when he ete, slepte and rode, all that tyme he thought was but in
ydelnes and hevy onto hym.  CMEDMUND-M4,168.167

But all <P_169> that he labourid in holy studye or bedis-byddyng
or almesdede-doyng, all suche thynges was moost plesaunce to hym,
CMEDMUND-M4,169.168

and he was neuer wery of suche werkys CMEDMUND-M4,169.169

for he was all hole yeuyn to Goddys seruyce and to hys plesyng.
CMEDMUND-M4,169.170

And also he was a notable prechoure CMEDMUND-M4,169.171

and gretely his techyng edefyed in the people that all people had grete
devosyon to hyre his prechyng.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.172

In that tyme the pope sente his crosser to the bysshoppis of Ynglonde
that thaye shulde chese a wyse clerke that shulde proclayme the popys
entent thurgh this realme of Ynglond for to haue helpe and socoure
ayenste the Turke, Goddes enmy.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.173

And so by one assent theye chose Seynt Edmond to proclayme the popys
wylle.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.174

And soo he dyd that charge full welle and dyligently thurgh this londe,
CMEDMUND-M4,169.175

and moche people he causyd to take the crosse and for to go into the
Holy Londe.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.176

And as a yong mann came with other to resseyue the crosse, a woman that
louyd hym lette hym of hys purpose CMEDMUND-M4,169.177

and she drewe hym fast awaye fro thens with hir hondys.
CMEDMUND-M4,169.178

And anone bothe hir hondis were styffe and harde as a borde
CMEDMUND-M4,169.179

and also hir hondis wax all crokyd.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.180

And than she made grete sorowe CMEDMUND-M4,169.181

and cryed God mercye; CMEDMUND-M4,169.182

and she prayed Seynt Edmond to praye for hir to oure Lorde.
CMEDMUND-M4,169.183

And he sayde to hir:'Woman, wylt thue take the crosse? '
CMEDMUND-M4,169.184

And she sayde:'Yee, sir, full fayne. 'CMEDMUND-M4,169.185

And than she resseyuid it CMEDMUND-M4,169.186

and was made hole.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.187

And than she thankyd oure Lorde, Jesu Cryste, and his holy seruaunt,
Seynt Edmond.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.188

And thurgh this grete myracle moche more people toke the crosse.
CMEDMUND-M4,169.189

In a tyme as this holy man prechyd at Oxforde in the churcheyerthe
of Alhalwyn and moche people was there to hyre his holy prechyng.
Sodenly there waxed so derke weder that alle the people were sore agast
; CMEDMUND-M4,169.190

and moche people beganne to go awaye, the wynde and the weder was so
horryble.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.191

And than this holy man sayde to the people:'Abyde ye stylle here
CMEDMUND-M4,169.192

ffor the power of God is strenger than the feendis power,
CMEDMUND-M4,169.193

for thus he doyth for envye to distrouble Goddes worde. '
CMEDMUND-M4,169.194

And than Seynte Edmond lyfte vppe his mynde to oure Lorde
CMEDMUND-M4,169.195

and besought of mercy and grace.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.196

And when he had endid his oryson, the weder beganne to withdrawe bye
the other syde of the churche.  CMEDMUND-M4,169.197

And all the people that abode there stylle to hyre the prechyng had not
one drope <P_170> of rayne.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.198

But thaye that wente awaye fro the sermon were thurghwette with the
rayne, CMEDMUND-M4,170.199

and there fylle so moche rayne in the hye strete that men myght neither
go ner ride therein.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.200

And than alle the people preysid God in his seruaunt for this grete
myracle.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.201

And at Wynchester another tyme, when he prechyd, was shewid there a lyke
myracle CMEDMUND-M4,170.202

for there he chasyd awaye suche a derke wether by hys holy prayer.
CMEDMUND-M4,170.203

Than for his holy levyng he was chose hye chanon at Salysbury
CMEDMUND-M4,170.204

and there he was made rewler and tresourer.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.205

And there he levyd a full gode lyve, CMEDMUND-M4,170.206

for all the mony that he myght gete he yeaff hyt in almes to pore
folkys for the loue of God that he had nothyng to leve by hymself.
CMEDMUND-M4,170.207

And than he wente to thabbey of Stanley CMEDMUND-M4,170.208

and soiournyd there tylle hys rentys came in, CMEDMUND-M4,170.209

ffor Maister Stephyn Lexston that there was abbott was somtyme his scoler
in Oxford.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.210

He was so lytle an etyr that menn woundryd howe he levyd.
CMEDMUND-M4,170.211

And yett he wolde ete no costelewe mete CMEDMUND-M4,170.212

for full selde he ete any flessh.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.213

And fro Shroftyde tyll Ester he wolde ete no mete that suffryd the dethe
, CMEDMUND-M4,170.214

not in Aduent he ete neuer but Lente-mete.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.215

And when the Archiebisshopp of Canterbury was dede, he was chose by all
the covent to be there bysshopp.  CMEDMUND-M4,170.216

And anone thaye sent there messyngers to hym to Salysbury,
CMEDMUND-M4,170.217

but he was then at Calne which was then one of hys prebendis.
CMEDMUND-M4,170.218

There he was prevyly in hys chambir allone in his prayers;
CMEDMUND-M4,170.219

and one of his chapeleyns came into his chambyr CMEDMUND-M4,170.220
