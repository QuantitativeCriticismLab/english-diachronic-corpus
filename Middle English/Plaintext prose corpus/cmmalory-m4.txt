<$$heading>

HIT befel in the dayes of Uther Pendragon, when he was kynge of all
Englond and so regned, that there was a myghty duke in Cornewaill that
helde warre ageynst hym long tyme, CMMALORY-M4,2.6

and the duke was called the duke of Tyntagil.  CMMALORY-M4,2.7

And so by meanes kynge Uther send for this duk chargyng hym to brynge
his wyf with hym, CMMALORY-M4,2.8

for she was called a fair lady and a passynge wyse, CMMALORY-M4,2.9

and her name was called Igrayne.  CMMALORY-M4,2.10

So whan the duke and his wyf were comyn unto the kynge, by the meanes
of grete lordes they were accorded bothe.  CMMALORY-M4,2.11

The kynge lyked and loved this lady wel, CMMALORY-M4,2.12

and he made them grete chere out of mesure CMMALORY-M4,2.13

and desyred to have lyen by her, CMMALORY-M4,2.14

but she was a passyng good woman CMMALORY-M4,2.15

and wold not assente unto the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,2.16

And thenne she told the duke her husband CMMALORY-M4,2.17

and said,'I suppose that we were sente for that I shold be dishonoured.
Wherfor, husband, I counceille yow that we departe from hens sodenly,
that we maye ryde all nyghte unto oure owne castell.  'CMMALORY-M4,2.18

And in lyke wyse as {in} she saide so they departed, that neyther
the kynge nor none of his counceill were ware of their departyng.
CMMALORY-M4,2.19

Also soone as kyng Uther knewe of theire departyng soo sodenly, he was
wonderly wrothe; CMMALORY-M4,2.20

thenne he called to hym his pryvy counceille CMMALORY-M4,2.21

and told them of the sodeyne departyng of the duke and his wyf.
CMMALORY-M4,2.22

Thenne they avysed the kynge to send for the duke and his wyf by a grete
charge: CMMALORY-M4,2.23

'And yf he wille not Come at your somons, thenne may ye do your best ;
CMMALORY-M4,2.24

thenne have ye cause to make myghty werre upon hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,2.25

Soo that was done, CMMALORY-M4,2.26

and the messagers hadde their ansuers; CMMALORY-M4,2.27

and that was thys, shortly, that neyther he nor his wyf wold not come
at hym.  CMMALORY-M4,2.28

Thenne was the kyng wonderly wroth; CMMALORY-M4,2.29

and thenne the kyng sente hym playne word ageyne CMMALORY-M4,2.30

and badde hym be redy and stuffe hym and garnysshe hym, CMMALORY-M4,2.31

for within forty dayes he wold fetche hym oute of the byggest castell
that he hath.  CMMALORY-M4,2.32

Whanne the duke hadde thys warnynge anone he wente CMMALORY-M4,2.33

and furnysshed and garnysshed two stronge castels of his, of the
whiche the one hyght Tyntagil and the other castel hyght Terrabyl.
CMMALORY-M4,2.34

So his <P_3> wyf, dame Igrayne, he putte in the castell of Tyntagil,
CMMALORY-M4,3.35

and hymself he putte in the castel of Terrabyl, the whiche had many
yssues and posternes oute.  CMMALORY-M4,3.36

Thenne in all haste came Uther with a grete hoost CMMALORY-M4,3.37

and leyd a syege aboute the castel of Terrabil, CMMALORY-M4,3.38

and ther he pyght many pavelyons.  CMMALORY-M4,3.39

And there was grete warre made on bothe partyes and moche peple slayne.
CMMALORY-M4,3.40

Thenne for pure angre and for grete love of fayr Igrayne the kyng Uther
felle seke.  CMMALORY-M4,3.41

So came to the kynge Uther syre Ulfius, a noble knyght, CMMALORY-M4,3.42

and asked the kynge why he was seke.  CMMALORY-M4,3.43

'I shall telle the,'said the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,3.44

'I am seke for angre and for love of fayre Igrayne, that I may not be
hool. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.45

'Wel, my lord,'said syre Ulfius,'I shal seke Merlyn CMMALORY-M4,3.46

and he shalle do yow remedy, that youre herte shal be pleasyd.
'CMMALORY-M4,3.47

So Ulfius departed CMMALORY-M4,3.48

and by adventure he mette Merlyn in a beggars aray, CMMALORY-M4,3.49

and ther Merlyn asked Ulfius whome he soughte, CMMALORY-M4,3.50

and he said he had lytyl ado to telle hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.51

Well,'saide Merlyn,'I knowe whome thou sekest, CMMALORY-M4,3.52

for thou sekest Merlyn; CMMALORY-M4,3.53

therfore seke no ferther, CMMALORY-M4,3.54

for I am he.  CMMALORY-M4,3.55

And yf kynge Uther wille wel rewarde me and be sworne unto me to
fulfille my desyre, that shall be his honour and profite more than myn
, CMMALORY-M4,3.56

for I shalle cause hym to have alle his desyre. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.57

'Alle this wyll I undertake,'said Ulfius,'that ther shalle be nothyng
resonable but thow shalt have thy desyre. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.58

'Well,'said Merlyn,'he shall have his entente and desyre, CMMALORY-M4,3.59

and therfore,'saide Merlyn,'ryde on your wey, CMMALORY-M4,3.60

for I wille not be long behynde. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.61

Thenne Ulfius was glad CMMALORY-M4,3.62

and rode on more than a paas tyll that he came to kynge Uther Pendragon
and told hym he had met with Merlyn.  CMMALORY-M4,3.63

'Where is he? 'said the kyng.  CMMALORY-M4,3.64

'Sir,'said Ulfius,'he wille not dwelle long. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.65

Therwithal Ulfius was ware where Merlyn stood at the porche of the
pavelions dore, CMMALORY-M4,3.66

and thenne Merlyn was bounde to come to the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,3.67

Whan kyng Uther sawe hym he said he was welcome.  CMMALORY-M4,3.68

'Syr,'said Merlyn,'I knowe al your hert every dele.  CMMALORY-M4,3.69

So ye wil be sworn unto me, as ye be a true kynge enoynted, to fulfille
my desyre, ye shal have your desyre. 'CMMALORY-M4,3.70

<P_4>

Thenne the kyng was sworne upon the four Evangelistes.  CMMALORY-M4,4.72

'Syre,'said Merlyn,'this is my desyre: the first nyght that ye shal lye
by Igrayne ye shal gete a child on her; and whan that is borne, that
it shall be delyverd to me for to nourisshe $there $as {TEXT:thereas}
I wille have it, CMMALORY-M4,4.73

for it shal be your worship and the childis availle as mykel as the
child is worth. 'CMMALORY-M4,4.74

'I wylle wel,'said the kynge,'as thow wilt have it. ' CMMALORY-M4,4.75

'Now make you redy,'said Merlyn.  CMMALORY-M4,4.76

'This nyght ye shalle lye with Igrayne in the castel of Tyntigayll.
CMMALORY-M4,4.77

And ye shalle be lyke the duke her husband, CMMALORY-M4,4.78

Ulfyus shal be lyke syre Brastias, a knyghte of the dukes,
CMMALORY-M4,4.79

and I will be lyke a knyghte that hyghte syr Jordanus, a knyghte of
the dukes.  CMMALORY-M4,4.80

But wayte ye make not many questions with her nor her men,
CMMALORY-M4,4.81

but saye ye are diseased, CMMALORY-M4,4.82

and soo hye yow to bedde CMMALORY-M4,4.83

and ryse not on the morne tyll I come to yow, CMMALORY-M4,4.84

for the castel of Tyntygaill is but ten myle hens. 'CMMALORY-M4,4.85

Soo this was done as they devysed.  CMMALORY-M4,4.86

But the duke of Tyntigail aspyed hou the kyng rode fro the syege of
Tarabil.  CMMALORY-M4,4.87

And therfor that nyghte he yssued oute of the castel at a posterne for
to have distressid the kynges hooste, CMMALORY-M4,4.88

and so thorowe his owne yssue the duke hymself was slayne or ever the
kynge cam at the castel of Tyntigail.  CMMALORY-M4,4.89

So after the deth of the duke kyng Uther lay with Igrayne, more than
thre houres after his deth, CMMALORY-M4,4.90

and begat on her that $nyght Arthur; CMMALORY-M4,4.91

and or day cam, Merlyn cam to the kyng CMMALORY-M4,4.92

and bad hym make hym redy, CMMALORY-M4,4.93

and so he kist the lady Igrayne CMMALORY-M4,4.94

and departed in all hast.  CMMALORY-M4,4.95

But whan the lady herd telle of the duke her husband, and by all record he
was dede or ever kynge Uther came to her, thenne she merveilled who that
myghte be that laye with her in lykenes of her lord.  CMMALORY-M4,4.96

So she mourned pryvely CMMALORY-M4,4.97

and held hir pees.  CMMALORY-M4,4.98

Thenne alle the barons by one assent prayd the kynge of accord betwixe
the lady Igrayne and hym.  CMMALORY-M4,4.99

The kynge gaf hem leve, CMMALORY-M4,4.100

for fayne wold he have ben accorded with her; CMMALORY-M4,4.101

soo the kyng put alle the trust in Ulfyus to entrete bitwene them.
CMMALORY-M4,4.102

So by the entrete at the last the kyng and she met togyder.
CMMALORY-M4,4.103

'Now wille we doo wel,'said Ulfyus; CMMALORY-M4,4.104

'our kyng is a lusty knyghte and wyveles, CMMALORY-M4,4.105

and my lady Igrayne is a passynge fair lady; CMMALORY-M4,4.106

it were grete joye unto us all and hit myghte please the kynge to make
her his quene. 'CMMALORY-M4,4.107

<P_5>

Unto that they all well accordyd CMMALORY-M4,5.109

and meved it to the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,5.110

And anone lyke a lusty knyghte he assentid therto with good wille,
CMMALORY-M4,5.111

and so in alle haste they were maryed in a mornynge with grete myrthe
and joye.  CMMALORY-M4,5.112

And kynge Lott of Lowthean and of Orkenay thenne wedded Margawse that
was Gaweyns moder, CMMALORY-M4,5.113

and kynge Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elayne: CMMALORY-M4,5.114

al this was done at the request of kynge Uther.  CMMALORY-M4,5.115

And the thyrd syster, Morgan le Fey, was put to scole in a nonnery,
CMMALORY-M4,5.116

and ther she lerned so moche that she was a grete clerke of nygromancye.
CMMALORY-M4,5.117

And after she was wedded to kynge Uryens of the lond of Gore that was
syre Ewayns le Blaunche Maynys fader.  CMMALORY-M4,5.118

Thenne quene Igrayne waxid dayly gretter and gretter.  CMMALORY-M4,5.119

So it befel after within half a yere, as kyng Uther lay by his quene,
he asked hir by the feith she ought to hym whos was the child within
her body.  CMMALORY-M4,5.120

Thenne was she sore abasshed to yeve ansuer.  CMMALORY-M4,5.121

'Desmaye you not,'said the kyng,'but telle me the trouthe, and I shall
love you the better, by the feythe of my body! ' CMMALORY-M4,5.122

'Syre,'saide she,'I shalle telle you the trouthe.  CMMALORY-M4,5.123

The same nyghte that my lord was dede, the houre of his deth as his
knyghtes record, ther came into my castel of Tyntigaill a man lyke my
lord in speche and in countenaunce, and two knyghtes with hym in lykenes
of his two knyghtes Barcias and Jordans, CMMALORY-M4,5.124

and soo I went unto bed with hym as I ought to do with my lord;
CMMALORY-M4,5.125

and the same nyght, as I shal ansuer unto God, this child was begoten
upon me. 'CMMALORY-M4,5.126

'That is trouthe,'saide the kynge,'as ye say, CMMALORY-M4,5.127

for it was I myself that cam in the lykenesse.  CMMALORY-M4,5.128

And therfor desmay you not, CMMALORY-M4,5.129

for I am fader to the child,'CMMALORY-M4,5.130

and ther he told her alle the cause how it was by Merlyns counceil.
CMMALORY-M4,5.131

Thenne the quene made grete joye whan she knewe who was the fader of
her Child.  CMMALORY-M4,5.132

Sone come Merlyn unto the kyng CMMALORY-M4,5.133

and said,'Syr, ye must purvey yow for the nourisshyng of your child.
'CMMALORY-M4,5.134

'As thou wolt,'said the kyng,'be it. 'CMMALORY-M4,5.135

'Wel,'said Merlyn,'I knowe a lord of yours in this land that is a passyng
true man and a feithful, CMMALORY-M4,5.136

and he shal have the nourysshyng of your child; CMMALORY-M4,5.137

and his name is sir Ector, CMMALORY-M4,5.138

and he is a lord of fair lyvelode in many partyes in Englond and Walys.
CMMALORY-M4,5.139

And this lord, sir <P_6> Ector, lete hym be sent for for to come and
speke with you, CMMALORY-M4,6.140

and desyre hym yourself as he loveth you that he will put his owne
child to nourisshynge to another woman and that his wyf nourisshe yours.
CMMALORY-M4,6.141

And whan the child is borne lete it be delyverd to me at yonder pryvy
posterne, uncrystned. 'CMMALORY-M4,6.142

So like as Merlyn devysed it was done.  CMMALORY-M4,6.143

And whan syre Ector was come he made fyaunce to the kyng for to nourisshe
the child lyke as the kynge desyred, CMMALORY-M4,6.144

and there the kyng graunted syr Ector grete rewardys.  CMMALORY-M4,6.145

Thenne when the lady was delyverd the kynge commaunded two knyghtes
and two ladyes to take the child bound in a cloth of gold,'and that ye
delyver hym to what poure man ye mete at the posterne yate of the castel.
'CMMALORY-M4,6.146

So the child was delyverd unto Merlyn, CMMALORY-M4,6.147

and so he bare it forth unto syre Ector CMMALORY-M4,6.148

and made an holy man to crysten hym CMMALORY-M4,6.149

and named hym Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,6.150

And so sir Ectors wyf nourysshed hym with her owne pappe.
CMMALORY-M4,6.151

Thenne within two yeres kyng Uther felle seke of a grete maladye.
CMMALORY-M4,6.152

And in the meanewhyle hys enemyes usurpped upon hym CMMALORY-M4,6.153

and dyd a grete bataylle upon his men CMMALORY-M4,6.154

and slewe many of his peple.  CMMALORY-M4,6.155

'Sir,'said Merlyn,'ye may not lye so as ye doo, CMMALORY-M4,6.156

for ye must to the feld, though ye ryde on an hors-lyttar.
CMMALORY-M4,6.157

For ye shall never have the better of your enemyes but yf your persone
be there, CMMALORY-M4,6.158

and thenne shall ye have the vyctory. 'CMMALORY-M4,6.159

So it was done as Merlyn had devysed, CMMALORY-M4,6.160

and they caryed the kynge forth in an hors-lyttar with a grete hooste
towarde his enemyes, CMMALORY-M4,6.161

and at Saynt Albons ther mette with the kynge a grete hoost of the North.
CMMALORY-M4,6.162

And that day syre Ulfyus and sir Bracias dyd grete dedes of armes,
CMMALORY-M4,6.163

and kyng Uthers men overcome the northeryn bataylle CMMALORY-M4,6.164

and slewe many peple CMMALORY-M4,6.165

and putt the remenaunt to flight; CMMALORY-M4,6.166

and thenne the kyng retorned unto London CMMALORY-M4,6.167

and made grete joye of his vyctory.  CMMALORY-M4,6.168

And thenne he fyll passynge sore seke so that thre dayes and thre nyghtes
he was specheles; wherfore alle the barons made grete sorow and asked
Merlyn what counceill were best.  CMMALORY-M4,6.169

'There nys none other remedye,'said Merlyn,'but God wil have his wille.
CMMALORY-M4,6.170

But loke ye al barons be bifore kynge Uther to-morne, and God and I
shalle make hym to speke. 'CMMALORY-M4,6.171

So on the morne alle the barons with Merlyn came tofore the kyng.
CMMALORY-M4,6.172

Thenne Merlyn said aloud unto kyng Uther, <P_7>'Syre, shall your
sone Arthur be kyng after your dayes of this realme with all the
appertenaunce? 'CMMALORY-M4,7.173

Thenne Uther Pendragon torned hym CMMALORY-M4,7.174

and said in herynge of hem alle,'I gyve hym Gods blissyng and myne,
CMMALORY-M4,7.175

and byd hym pray for my soule, and righteuously and worshipfully that
he clayme the croune upon forfeture of my blessyng,'CMMALORY-M4,7.176

and therwith he yelde up the ghost.  CMMALORY-M4,7.177

And thenne was he enterid as longed to a kyng, wherfor the quene, fayre
Igrayne, made grete sorowe and alle the barons.  CMMALORY-M4,7.178

Thenne stood the reame in grete jeopardy long whyle, CMMALORY-M4,7.179

for every lord that was myghty of men maade hym stronge, CMMALORY-M4,7.180

and many wende to have ben kyng.  CMMALORY-M4,7.181

Thenne Merlyn wente to the Archebisshop of Caunterbury CMMALORY-M4,7.182

and counceilled hym for to sende for all the lordes of the reame and
alle the gentilmen of armes that they shold to London come by Cristmas
upon payne of cursynge, and for this cause, that Jesu, that was borne
on that nyghte, that He wold of His grete mercy shewe some myracle,
as He was come to be Kynge of mankynde, for to shewe somme myracle who
shold be rightwys kynge of this reame.  CMMALORY-M4,7.183

So the Archebisshop by the advys of Merlyn send for alle the lordes and
gentilmen of armes that they shold come by Crystmasse even unto London,
CMMALORY-M4,7.184

and many of hem made hem clene of her lyf, that her prayer myghte be
the more acceptable unto God.  CMMALORY-M4,7.185

Soo in the grettest chirch of London - whether it were Powlis or not
the Frensshe booke maketh no mencyon - alle the estates were longe or
day in the chirche for to praye.  CMMALORY-M4,7.186

And whan matyns and the first masse was done there was sene in the
chircheyard ayenst the hyhe aulter a grete stone four square, lyke unto
a marbel stone; CMMALORY-M4,7.187

and in myddes therof was lyke an anvylde of stele a foot on hyghe,
CMMALORY-M4,7.188

and theryn stack a fayre swerd naked by the poynt, CMMALORY-M4,7.189

and letters there were wryten in gold aboute the swerd that saiden thus:
'WHOSO PULLETH OUTE THIS SWERD OF THIS STONE AND ANVYLD IS RIGHTWYS
KYNGE BORNE OF ALL $ENGLOND. 'CMMALORY-M4,7.190

Thenne the peple merveilled CMMALORY-M4,7.191

and told it to the Archebisshop.  CMMALORY-M4,7.192

'I commande,'said th'Archebisshop,'that ye kepe yow within your chirche
and pray unto God still; that no man touche the swerd tyll the hyhe
masse be all done. 'CMMALORY-M4,7.193

So whan all masses were done all the lordes wente to beholde the <P_8>
stone and the swerd.  CMMALORY-M4,8.194

And whan they sawe the scripture som assayed suche as wold have ben kyng
, CMMALORY-M4,8.195

but none myght stere the swerd nor meve hit.  CMMALORY-M4,8.196

'He is not here,'said the Archebisshop,'that shall encheve the swerd,
CMMALORY-M4,8.197

but doubte not, God will make hym knowen.  CMMALORY-M4,8.198

But this is my counceill,'said the Archebisshop,'that we lete
purvey ten knyghtes, men of good fame, and they to kepe this swerd.
'CMMALORY-M4,8.199

So it was ordeyned, CMMALORY-M4,8.200

and thenne ther was made a crye that every man shold assay that wold
for to wynne the swerd.  CMMALORY-M4,8.201

And upon Newe Yeers day the barons lete maake a justes and a tournement
, that alle knyghtes that wold juste or tourneye there myght playe.
CMMALORY-M4,8.202

And all this was ordeyned for to kepe the lordes togyders and the comyns
, CMMALORY-M4,8.203

for the Archebisshop trusted that God wold make hym knowe that shold
wynne the swerd.  CMMALORY-M4,8.204

So upon New Yeres day, whan the servyce was done, the barons rode unto
the feld, some to juste and som to torney.  CMMALORY-M4,8.205

And so it happed that syre Ector that had grete lyvelode aboute London
rode unto the justes, CMMALORY-M4,8.206

and with hym rode syr Kaynus, his sone, and yong Arthur that was hys
nourisshed broder; CMMALORY-M4,8.207

and syr Kay was made knyght at Alhalowmas afore.  CMMALORY-M4,8.208

So as they rode to the justes ward sir Kay had lost his suerd,
CMMALORY-M4,8.209

for he had lefte it at his faders lodgyng, CMMALORY-M4,8.210

and so he prayd yong Arthur for to ryde for his swerd.  CMMALORY-M4,8.211

'I wyll wel,'said Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,8.212

and rode fast after the swerd.  CMMALORY-M4,8.213

And whan he cam home the lady and al were out to see the joustyng.
CMMALORY-M4,8.214

Thenne was Arthur wroth CMMALORY-M4,8.215

and saide to hymself,'I will ryde to the chircheyard and take the swerd
with me that stycketh in the stone, CMMALORY-M4,8.216

for my broder sir Kay shal not be without a swerd this day. '
CMMALORY-M4,8.217

So whan he cam to the chircheyard sir Arthur alight CMMALORY-M4,8.218

and tayed his hors to the style, CMMALORY-M4,8.219

and so he wente to the tent CMMALORY-M4,8.220

and found no knyghtes there, CMMALORY-M4,8.221

for they were atte justyng.  CMMALORY-M4,8.222

And so he handled the swerd by the handels, CMMALORY-M4,8.223

and lightly and fiersly pulled it out of the stone, CMMALORY-M4,8.224

and took his hors CMMALORY-M4,8.225

and rode his way untyll he came to his broder sir Kay and delyverd hym
the swerd.  CMMALORY-M4,8.226

And as sone as sir Kay saw the swerd he wist wel it was the swerd of
the stone, CMMALORY-M4,8.227

and so he rode to his fader syr Ector CMMALORY-M4,8.228

and said,'Sire, loo here is the swerd of the stone, wherfor I must be
kyng of thys land. 'CMMALORY-M4,8.229

When syre Ector beheld the swerd he retorned ageyne CMMALORY-M4,8.230

and cam <P_9> to the chirche, CMMALORY-M4,9.231

and there they alighte al thre CMMALORY-M4,9.232

and wente into the chirche, CMMALORY-M4,9.233

and anon he made sir Kay to swere upon a book how he came to that swerd.
CMMALORY-M4,9.234

'Syr,'said sir Kay,'by my broder Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,9.235

for he brought it to me. 'CMMALORY-M4,9.236

'How gate ye this swerd? 'said sir Ector to Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,9.237

'Sir, I will telle you.  CMMALORY-M4,9.238

When I cam home for my broders swerd I fond nobody at home to delyver
me his swerd, CMMALORY-M4,9.239

and so I thought my broder syr Kay shold not be swerdles,
CMMALORY-M4,9.240

and so I cam hyder egerly CMMALORY-M4,9.241

and pulled it out of the stone withoute ony payn. 'CMMALORY-M4,9.242

'Found ye ony knyghtes about this swerd? 'seid sir Ector.
CMMALORY-M4,9.243

'Nay,'said Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,9.244

'Now,'said sir Ector to Arthur,'I understande ye must be kynge of this
land. 'CMMALORY-M4,9.245

'Wherfore I? 'sayd Arthur,'and for what cause? ' CMMALORY-M4,9.246

'Sire,'saide Ector,'for God wille have hit soo, CMMALORY-M4,9.247

for ther shold never man have drawen oute this swerde but he that shal
be rightwys kyng of this land.  CMMALORY-M4,9.248

Now lete me see whether ye can putte the swerd $theras $as {TEXT:theras}
it was and pulle hit oute ageyne. 'CMMALORY-M4,9.249

'That is no maystry,'said Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,9.250

and soo he put it in the stone.  CMMALORY-M4,9.251

Therwithalle sir Ector assayed to pulle oute the swerd CMMALORY-M4,9.252

and faylled.  CMMALORY-M4,9.253

'Now assay', said syre Ector unto syre Kay.  CMMALORY-M4,9.254

And anon he pulled at the swerd with alle his myghte, CMMALORY-M4,9.255

but it wold not be.  CMMALORY-M4,9.256

'Now shal ye assay,'said syre Ector to Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,9.257

'I wyll wel,'said Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,9.258

and pulled it out easily.  CMMALORY-M4,9.259

And therwithalle syre Ector knelyd doune to the erthe and syre Kay.
CMMALORY-M4,9.260

'Allas! 'said Arthur,'myne own dere fader and broder, why knele ye to
me? 'CMMALORY-M4,9.261

'Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so.  CMMALORY-M4,9.262

I was never your fader nor of your blood, CMMALORY-M4,9.263

but I wote wel ye are of an hyher blood than I wende {of} ye were,
'CMMALORY-M4,9.264

and thenne syre Ector told hym all how he was bitaken hym for to
nourisshe hym and by whoos commandement, and by Merlyns delyveraunce.
CMMALORY-M4,9.265

Thenne Arthur made grete doole whan he understood that syre Ector was
not his fader.  CMMALORY-M4,9.266

'Sir,'said Ector unto Arthur,'woll ye be my good and gracious lord when
ye are kyng? 'CMMALORY-M4,9.267

<P_10>

'Els were I to blame,'said Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,10.269

'for ye are the man in the world that I am most beholdyng to, and my
good lady and moder your wyf that as wel as her owne hath fostred me
and kepte.  CMMALORY-M4,10.270

And yf ever hit be Goddes will that I be kynge as ye say, ye shall desyre
of me what I may doo CMMALORY-M4,10.271

and I shalle not faille yow.  CMMALORY-M4,10.272

God forbede I shold faille yow. 'CMMALORY-M4,10.273

'Sir,'said sire Ector,'I will aske no more of yow but that ye wille
make my sone, your foster-broder syre Kay, $senceall of alle your
landes. 'CMMALORY-M4,10.274

'That shalle be done,'said Arthur,'and more, by the feith of my body,
that never man shalle have that office but he whyle he and I lyve.
'CMMALORY-M4,10.275

Therewithall they wente unto the Archebisshop CMMALORY-M4,10.276

and told hym how the swerd was encheved and by whome.  CMMALORY-M4,10.277

And on twelfth day alle the barons cam thyder and to assay to take the
swerd who that wold assay, CMMALORY-M4,10.278

but there afore hem alle ther myghte none take it out but Arthur.
Wherfor ther were many lordes wroth and saide it was grete shame unto them
all and the reame to be overgovernyd with a boye of no hyghe blood borne.
CMMALORY-M4,10.279

And so they fell oute at that tyme, that it was put of tyll Candelmas,
CMMALORY-M4,10.280

and thenne all the barons shold mete there ageyne, CMMALORY-M4,10.281

but alwey the ten knyghtes were ordeyned to watche the swerd day and
nyght, CMMALORY-M4,10.282

and so they sette a pavelione over the stone and the swerd,
CMMALORY-M4,10.283

and fyve alwayes watched.  CMMALORY-M4,10.284

Soo at Candalmasse many moo grete lordes came thyder for to have wonne
the swerde, CMMALORY-M4,10.285

but there myghte none prevaille.  CMMALORY-M4,10.286

And right as Arthur dyd at Cristmasse he dyd at Candelmasse
CMMALORY-M4,10.287

and pulled oute the swerde easely, wherof the barons were sore agreved
and put it of in delay till the hyghe feste of Eester.  CMMALORY-M4,10.288

And as Arthur sped afore so dyd he at Eester.  CMMALORY-M4,10.289

Yet there were some of the grete lordes had indignacion that Arthur
shold be kynge, CMMALORY-M4,10.290

and put it of in a delay tyll the feest of Pentecoste.  CMMALORY-M4,10.291

Thenne the Archebisshop of Caunterbury by Merlyns provydence lete
purveye thenne of the best knyghtes that they myghte gete, and suche
knyghtes as Uther Pendragon loved best and moost trusted in his dayes.
CMMALORY-M4,10.292

And suche knyghtes were put aboute Arthur as syr Bawdewyn of Bretayn,
syre Kaynes, syre Ulfyus, syre Barsias; CMMALORY-M4,10.293

all these with many other were alweyes about Arthur day and nyghte till
the feste of Pentecost.  CMMALORY-M4,10.294

<P_11>

And at the feste of Pentecost alle maner of men assayed to pulle at the
swerde that wold assay, CMMALORY-M4,11.296

but none myghte prevaille but Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,11.297

and he pulled it oute afore all the lordes and comyns that were there.
Wherfore alle the comyns cryed at ones,'We wille have Arthur unto
our kyng!  CMMALORY-M4,11.298

We wille put hym no more in delay, CMMALORY-M4,11.299

for we all see that it is Goddes wille that he shalle be our kynge,
CMMALORY-M4,11.300

and who that holdeth ageynst it we wille slee hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,11.301

And therwithall they knelyd at ones both ryche and poure
CMMALORY-M4,11.302

and cryed Arthur mercy bycause they had delayed hym so longe.
CMMALORY-M4,11.303

And Arthur foryaf hem CMMALORY-M4,11.304

and took the swerd bitwene both his handes CMMALORY-M4,11.305

and offred it upon the aulter where the Archebisshop was,
CMMALORY-M4,11.306

and so was he made knyghte of the best man that was there.
CMMALORY-M4,11.307

And so anon was the coronacyon made, CMMALORY-M4,11.308

and ther was he sworne unto his lordes and the comyns for to be a true
kyng, to stand with true justyce fro thens forth the dayes of this lyf.
CMMALORY-M4,11.309

Also thenne he made alle lordes that helde of the croune to come in and
to do servyce as they oughte to doo.  CMMALORY-M4,11.310

And many complayntes were made unto sir Arthur of grete wronges that
were done syn the dethe of kyng Uther, of many londes that were bereved
lordes , knyghtes, ladyes, and gentilmen; wherfor kynge Arthur maade the
londes to be yeven ageyne unto them that oughte hem.  CMMALORY-M4,11.311

Whanne this was done that the kyng had stablisshed alle the countreyes
aboute London, thenne he lete make syr Kay sencial of Englond,
CMMALORY-M4,11.312

and sir Baudewyn of Bretayne was made constable, CMMALORY-M4,11.313

and sir Ulfyus was made chamberlayn, CMMALORY-M4,11.314

and sire Brastias was maade wardeyn to wayte upon the Northe fro Trent
forwardes, CMMALORY-M4,11.315

for it was that tyme the most party the kynges enemyes.
CMMALORY-M4,11.316

But within fewe yeres after Arthur wan alle the North, Scotland and alle
that were under their obeissaunce, also Walys; CMMALORY-M4,11.317

a parte of it helde ayenst Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,11.318

but he overcam hem al as he dyd the remenaunt thurgh the noble prowesse
of hymself and his knyghtes of the Round Table.  CMMALORY-M4,11.319

Thenne the kyng remeved into Walys CMMALORY-M4,11.320

and lete crye a grete feste, that it shold be holdyn at Pentecost after
the incoronacion of hym at the cyte of Carlyon.  CMMALORY-M4,11.321

Unto the fest come kyng Lott of Lowthean and of Orkeney with fyve hondred
knyghtes with hym; CMMALORY-M4,11.322

also ther come to the feste kynge Uryens of Gore with four hondred
knyghtes with hym; CMMALORY-M4,11.323

also ther come to that feeste kyng Nayntres of Garloth <P_12> with seven
hundred knyghtes with hym, CMMALORY-M4,12.324

also ther came to the feest the kynge of Scotland with sixe honderd
knyghtes with hym, CMMALORY-M4,12.325

and he was but a yong man.  CMMALORY-M4,12.326

Also ther came to the feste a kyng that was called the Kyng with the
Honderd Knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,12.327

but he and his men were passyng wel bisene at al poyntes;
CMMALORY-M4,12.328

also ther cam the kyng of Cardos with fyve honderd knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,12.329

And kyng Arthur was glad of their comynge, CMMALORY-M4,12.330

for he wende that al the kynges and knyghtes had come for grete love and
to have done hym worship at his feste, wherfor the kyng made grete joye
and sente the kynges and knyghtes grete presentes.  CMMALORY-M4,12.331

But the kynges wold none receyve, CMMALORY-M4,12.332

but rebuked the messagers shamefully CMMALORY-M4,12.333

and said they had no joye to receyve no yeftes of a berdles boye that
was come of lowe blood, CMMALORY-M4,12.334

and sente hym word they wold none of his yeftes, but that they were come
to gyve hym yeftes with hard swerdys betwixt the neck and the sholders;
CMMALORY-M4,12.335

and therfore they came thyder, so they told to the messagers playnly,
CMMALORY-M4,12.336

for it was grete shame to all them to see suche a boye to have a rule
of soo noble a reaume as this land was.  CMMALORY-M4,12.337

With this ansuer the messagers departed CMMALORY-M4,12.338

and told to kyng Arthur this ansuer, wherfor by the advys of his barons
he took hym to a strong towre with fyve hondred good men with hym.
CMMALORY-M4,12.339

And all the kynges aforesaid in a maner leyd a syege tofore hym,
CMMALORY-M4,12.340

but kyng Arthur was well vytailled.  CMMALORY-M4,12.341

And within fyftene dayes ther came Merlyn amonge hem into the cyte
of Carlyon.  CMMALORY-M4,12.342

Thenne all the kynges were passyng gladde of Merlyn CMMALORY-M4,12.343

and asked hym,'For what Cause is that boye Arthur made your kynge?
'CMMALORY-M4,12.344

'Syres,'said Merlyn,'I shalle telle yow the cause, CMMALORY-M4,12.345

for he is kynge Uther Pendragons sone borne in wedlok, goten on Igrayne,
the dukes wyf of Tyntigail. 'CMMALORY-M4,12.346

'Thenne is he a bastard,'they said al.  CMMALORY-M4,12.347

'Nay,'said Merlyn,'after the deth of the duke more than thre houres
was Arthur begoten, and thirtene dayes after kyng Uther wedded Igrayne,
CMMALORY-M4,12.348

and therfor I preve hym CMMALORY-M4,12.349

he is no bastard.  CMMALORY-M4,12.350

And, who saith nay, he shal be kyng and overcome alle his enemyes,
CMMALORY-M4,12.351

and or he deye he shalle be long kynge of all Englond and have under his
obeyssaunce Walys, Yrland, and Scotland, and moo reames than I will now
reherce. 'CMMALORY-M4,12.352

<P_13>

Some of the kynges had merveyl of Merlyns wordes CMMALORY-M4,13.354

and demed well that it shold be as he said, CMMALORY-M4,13.355

and som of hem lough hym to scorne, as kyng Lot, CMMALORY-M4,13.356

and mo other called hym a wytche.  CMMALORY-M4,13.357

But thenne were they accorded with Merlyn that kynge Arthur shold come
oute and speke with the kynges, CMMALORY-M4,13.358

and to come sauf and to goo sauf, suche suraunce ther was made.
CMMALORY-M4,13.359

So Merlyn went unto kynge Arthur CMMALORY-M4,13.360

and told hym how he had done CMMALORY-M4,13.361

and badde hym,'Fere not, CMMALORY-M4,13.362

but come oute boldly CMMALORY-M4,13.363

and speke with hem; CMMALORY-M4,13.364

and spare hem not, CMMALORY-M4,13.365

but ansuere them as their kynge and chyvetayn, CMMALORY-M4,13.366

for ye shal overcome hem all, whether they wille or nylle. '
CMMALORY-M4,13.367

Thenne kynge Arthur came oute of his tour CMMALORY-M4,13.368

and had under his gowne a jesseraunte of double maylle, CMMALORY-M4,13.369

and ther wente with hym the Archebisshop of Caunterbury, and syr Baudewyn
of Bretayne, and syr Kay, and syre Brastias; CMMALORY-M4,13.370

these were the men of moost worship that were with hym.
CMMALORY-M4,13.371

And whan they were mette there was no mekenes but stoute wordes on bothe
sydes, CMMALORY-M4,13.372

but alweyes kynge Arthur ansuerd them CMMALORY-M4,13.373

and said he wold make them to bowe and he lyved, wherfore they departed
with wrath.  CMMALORY-M4,13.374

And kynge Arthur badde kepe hem wel, CMMALORY-M4,13.375

and they bad the kynge kepe hym wel.  CMMALORY-M4,13.376

Soo the kynge retornyd hym to the toure ageyne CMMALORY-M4,13.377

and armed hym and alle his knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,13.378

'What will ye do? 'said Merlyn to the kynges.  CMMALORY-M4,13.379

'Ye were better for to stynte, CMMALORY-M4,13.380

for ye shalle not here prevaille, though ye were ten so many.
'CMMALORY-M4,13.381

'Be we wel avysed to be aferd of a dreme-reder? 'said kyng Lot.
CMMALORY-M4,13.382

With that Merlyn vanysshed aweye CMMALORY-M4,13.383

and came to kynge Arthur CMMALORY-M4,13.384

and bad hym set on hem fiersly.  CMMALORY-M4,13.385

And in the menewhyle there were thre honderd good men of the best
that were with the kynges that wente streyghte unto kynge Arthur,
CMMALORY-M4,13.386

and that comforted hym gretely.  CMMALORY-M4,13.387

'Syr,'said Merlyn to Arthur,'fyghte not with the swerde that ye had by
myracle til that ye see ye go unto the wers; CMMALORY-M4,13.388

thenne drawe it out CMMALORY-M4,13.389

and do your best. 'CMMALORY-M4,13.390

So forthwithalle kynge Arthur sette upon hem in their lodgyng,
CMMALORY-M4,13.391

and syre Bawdewyn, syre Kay, and syr Brastias slewe on the right hand
and on the lyfte hand, that it was merveylle; CMMALORY-M4,13.392

and alweyes kynge Arthur on horsback leyd on with a swerd
CMMALORY-M4,13.393

and dyd merveillous dedes of armes, that many of the kynges had grete
joye of his dedes and <P_14> hardynesse.  CMMALORY-M4,14.394

Thenne kynge Lot brake out on the bak syde, and the kyng with the Honderd
Knyghtes and kyng Carados, CMMALORY-M4,14.395

and sette on Arthur fiersly behynde hym.  CMMALORY-M4,14.396

With that syre Arthur torned with his knyghtes CMMALORY-M4,14.397

and smote behynd and before, CMMALORY-M4,14.398

and ever sir Arthur was in the formest prees tyl his hors was slayne
undernethe hym.  CMMALORY-M4,14.399

And therwith kynge Lot smote doune kyng Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,14.400

With that his four knyghtes $reskowed hym CMMALORY-M4,14.401

and set hym on horsback; CMMALORY-M4,14.402

thenne he drewe his swerd Excalibur, CMMALORY-M4,14.403

but it was so bryght in his enemyes eyen that it gaf light lyke thirty
torchys, CMMALORY-M4,14.404

and therwith he put hem on bak CMMALORY-M4,14.405

and slewe moche peple.  CMMALORY-M4,14.406

And thenne the comyns of Carlyon aroos with clubbis and stavys
CMMALORY-M4,14.407

and slewe many knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,14.408

but alle the kynges helde them togyders with her knyghtes that were
lefte on lyve, CMMALORY-M4,14.409

and so fled and departed; CMMALORY-M4,14.410

and Merlyn come unto Arthur CMMALORY-M4,14.411

and counceilled hym to folowe hem no further.  CMMALORY-M4,14.412

So after the feste and journeye kynge Arthur drewe hym unto London.
CMMALORY-M4,14.413

And soo by the counceil of Merlyn the kyng lete calle his barons to
counceil, CMMALORY-M4,14.414

for Merlyn had told the kynge that the sixe kynges that made warre upon
hym wold in al haste be awroke on hym and on his landys; wherfor the
kyng asked counceil at hem al.  CMMALORY-M4,14.415

They coude no counceil gyve, CMMALORY-M4,14.416

but said they were bygge ynough.  CMMALORY-M4,14.417

'Ye saye well,'said Arthur, CMMALORY-M4,14.418

'I thanke you for your good courage; CMMALORY-M4,14.419

but wil ye al that loveth me speke with Merlyn?  CMMALORY-M4,14.420

Ye knowe wel that he hath done moche for me, CMMALORY-M4,14.421

and he knoweth many thynges.  CMMALORY-M4,14.422

And whan he is afore you I wold that ye prayd hym hertely of his best
avyse. 'CMMALORY-M4,14.423

Alle the barons sayd they wold pray hym and desyre hym.
CMMALORY-M4,14.424

Soo Merlyn was sente for and fair desyred of al the barons to gyve them
best counceil.  CMMALORY-M4,14.425

'I shall say you,'said Merlyn, CMMALORY-M4,14.426

'I warne yow al, CMMALORY-M4,14.427

your enemyes are passyng strong for yow, CMMALORY-M4,14.428

and they are good men of armes as ben on lyve.  CMMALORY-M4,14.429

And by thys tyme they have goten to them four kynges mo and a myghty
duke, CMMALORY-M4,14.430

and onlesse that our kyng have more chyvalry with hym than he may make
within the boundys of his own reame, and he fyghte with hem in batail,
he shal be overcome and slayn. 'CMMALORY-M4,14.431

'What were best to doo in this cause? 'said al the barons.
CMMALORY-M4,14.432

'I shal telle you,'said Merlyn,'myne advys.  CMMALORY-M4,14.433

There ar two bretheren <P_15> beyond the see, CMMALORY-M4,15.434

and they be kynges and merveillous good men of her handes:
CMMALORY-M4,15.435

and that one hyghte kynge Ban of Benwic, CMMALORY-M4,15.436

and that other hyght kyng Bors of Gaule, that is Fraunce.
CMMALORY-M4,15.437

And on these two kynges warrith a myghty man of men, the kynge Claudas ,
CMMALORY-M4,15.438

and stryveth with hem for a castel; CMMALORY-M4,15.439

and grete werre is betwixt them.  CMMALORY-M4,15.440

But this Claudas is so myghty of goodes wherof he geteth good knyghtes
that he putteth these two kynges moost parte $to the werse.  Wherfor this
is my counceil: that our kyng and soverayne lord sende unto the kynges
Ban and Bors by two trusty knyghtes with letters wel devysed, that and
they wil come and see kynge Arthur and his courte and helpe hym in hys
warrys, that he wolde be sworne unto them to helpe hem in theire warrys
agaynst kynge Claudas.  CMMALORY-M4,15.441

Now what sey ye unto thys counceyle? 'seyde Merlyon. ' CMMALORY-M4,15.442

Thys ys well councelde,'seyde the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,15.443

And in all haste two barownes ryght so were ordayned to go on thys
message unto thes two kyngis, CMMALORY-M4,15.444

and lettirs were made in the moste plesauntist wyse accordynge unto
kynge Arthurs desyre, CMMALORY-M4,15.445

and Ulphuns and Brastias were made the messyngers; CMMALORY-M4,15.446

and so rode forth well horsed and well i-armed and as the gyse was that
tyme, CMMALORY-M4,15.447

and so passed the see CMMALORY-M4,15.448

and rode towarde the cite of Benwyk.  CMMALORY-M4,15.449

And there besydes were eyght knyghtes that aspyed hem, CMMALORY-M4,15.450

and at a strayte passage they mette with Ulphuns and Brastias
CMMALORY-M4,15.451

and wolde a takyn them presoners.  CMMALORY-M4,15.452

So they preyde them that they myght passe, CMMALORY-M4,15.453

for they were messyngers unto kyng Ban and Bors isente frome kynge
Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,15.454

'Therefore,'seyde the knyghtes,'ye shall dey othir be presoners,
CMMALORY-M4,15.455

for we be knyghtes of kynge Claudas. 'CMMALORY-M4,15.456

And therewith two of them dressed their sperys unto Ulphuns and Brastias
, CMMALORY-M4,15.457

and they dressed their sperys CMMALORY-M4,15.458

and ran togydir with grete random.  CMMALORY-M4,15.459

And Claudas his knyghtes brake theire spearis, CMMALORY-M4,15.460

and Ulphuns and Brastias bare the two knyghtes oute of their sadils to
the erth CMMALORY-M4,15.461

and so leffte them lyynge CMMALORY-M4,15.462

and rode their wayes.  CMMALORY-M4,15.463

And the other six knyghtes rode before to a passage to mete with them
ayen, CMMALORY-M4,15.464

and so Ulphuns and Brastias othir two smote downe CMMALORY-M4,15.465

and so paste on hir wayes.  CMMALORY-M4,15.466

And at the fourthe passage there mette two for two CMMALORY-M4,15.467

and bothe were leyde unto the erthe.  CMMALORY-M4,15.468

So there was none of the eyght knyghtes but he was hurte sore othir
brused.  CMMALORY-M4,15.469

<P_16>

And whan they com to Benwyke hit fortuned both the kynges be there,
Ban and Bors.  CMMALORY-M4,16.471

Than was hit tolde the two kyngis how there were com two messyngers.
CMMALORY-M4,16.472

And anone there was sente unto them two knyghtes of worshyp,
CMMALORY-M4,16.473

that one hyght Lyonses, lorde of the contrey of $Payarne, and sir
Pharyaunce, a worshipfull knyght; CMMALORY-M4,16.474

and anone asked them frome whens they com, CMMALORY-M4,16.475

and they seyde frome kyng Arthure, kynge of Ingelonde.  CMMALORY-M4,16.476

And so they toke them in theire armys CMMALORY-M4,16.477

and made grete joy eche of othir.  CMMALORY-M4,16.478

But anone as they wyste they were messyngers of Arthurs there was made
no taryynge, CMMALORY-M4,16.479

but forthwith they spake with the kyngis.  CMMALORY-M4,16.480

And they welcommed them in the most faythfullyst wyse CMMALORY-M4,16.481

and seyde they were moste welcom unto them before all the kynges men
lyvynge.  CMMALORY-M4,16.482

And therewith they kyssed the lettirs CMMALORY-M4,16.483

and delyvird them.  CMMALORY-M4,16.484

And whan kynge Ban and Bors undirstoode them and the lettirs, than were
they more welcom than they were tofore.  CMMALORY-M4,16.485

And $aftir the haste of the lettirs they gaff hem thys answere that they
wolde fulfille $the desire of kyng Arthurs wrytynge, CMMALORY-M4,16.486

and bade sir Ulphuns and sir Brastias tarry there as longe as they wolde
, CMMALORY-M4,16.487

for they shulde have such chere as myght be made for them in thys marchis.
CMMALORY-M4,16.488

Than Ulphuns and Brastias tolde the kynge of theire adventure at the
passagis for the eyght knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,16.489

'A ha,'seyde Ban and Bors,'they were oure good frendis.
CMMALORY-M4,16.490

I wolde I had wyste of them, CMMALORY-M4,16.491

and they sholde nat so $have ascaped. 'CMMALORY-M4,16.492

So thes two knyghtes had good chere and grete gyfftis as much as they
myght bere away, CMMALORY-M4,16.493

and had theire answere by mowth and by wrytynge that the two kynges
wolde com unto Arthure in all the haste that {in} they myght.
CMMALORY-M4,16.494

So thes two knyghtes rode on afore CMMALORY-M4,16.495

and passed the see CMMALORY-M4,16.496

and com to their lorde CMMALORY-M4,16.497

and tolde hym how they had spedde, wherefore kyng Arthure was passyng
glad and seyde,'How suppose you, CMMALORY-M4,16.498

at what tyme woll thes two kynges be here? 'CMMALORY-M4,16.499

'Sir,'they seyde,'before Allhalowmasse. 'CMMALORY-M4,16.500

Than the kynge lette purvey a grete feste, CMMALORY-M4,16.501

and also he lette cry both turnementis and justis thorowoute all his
realme, CMMALORY-M4,16.502

and the day appoynted and sette at Allhalowmasse.  CMMALORY-M4,16.503

And so the tyme drove on CMMALORY-M4,16.504

and all thynges redy ipurveyed.  CMMALORY-M4,16.505

Thes two noble kynges were entirde the londe and comyn ovir the see with
three hondred knyghtes full well arayed both for the pees and also for
the werre.  CMMALORY-M4,16.506

And so royally <P_17> they were resceyved and brought towarde the cite
of London.  CMMALORY-M4,17.507

And so Arthure mette them ten myle oute of London, CMMALORY-M4,17.508

and there was grete joy made as couthe be thought.  CMMALORY-M4,17.509

And on Allhalowmasse day at the grete feste sate in the hall the three
kynges, CMMALORY-M4,17.510

and sir Kay the Senesciall served in the halle, and sir Lucas the Butler
that was Duke Corneus son, and sir Gryfflet that was the son of God of
Cardal: CMMALORY-M4,17.511

thes three knyghtes had the rule of all the servyse that served the
kyngis.  CMMALORY-M4,17.512

And anone as they were redy and $wayshen, all the knyghtes that wolde
juste made hem redy.  CMMALORY-M4,17.513

And be than they were redy on horsebak there was seven hondred knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,17.514

And kynge Arthure, Ban, and Bors, with the Archebysshop of Caunterbyry ,
and sir Ector, Kays fadir, they were in a place covirde with clothys of
golde lyke unto an halle, with ladyes and jantillwomen for to beholde
who dud beste and thereon to gyff a jugemente.  CMMALORY-M4,17.515

And kyng Arthure with the two kyngis lette departe the seven hondred
knyghtes in two partyes.  CMMALORY-M4,17.516

And there were three hondred knyghtes of the realme of Benwyke and Gaule
that turned on the othir syde.  CMMALORY-M4,17.517

And they dressed their shyldis CMMALORY-M4,17.518

and began to couche hir sperys, many good knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,17.519

So sir Gryfflet was the firste that sette oute, CMMALORY-M4,17.520

and to hym com a knyght, CMMALORY-M4,17.521

hys name was sir Ladynas, CMMALORY-M4,17.522

and they com so egirly togydir that all men had wondir, CMMALORY-M4,17.523

and they so sore fought that hir shyldis felle on pecis and both horse
and man felle to the erthe, CMMALORY-M4,17.524

and both the Frensh knyght and the Englysh knyght lay so longe that all
men wente they had bene dede.  CMMALORY-M4,17.525

Whan Lucas the Butler saw sir Gryfflet ly so longe, he horsed hym agayne
anone, CMMALORY-M4,17.526

and they too ded many mervelous dedis of armys with many bachelers.
CMMALORY-M4,17.527

Also sir Kay com oute of a bushemente with fyve knyghtes with hym,
CMMALORY-M4,17.528

and they six smote othir six downe.  CMMALORY-M4,17.529

But sir Kay dud that day many mervaylous dedis of armys, that there was
none that dud so welle as he that day.  CMMALORY-M4,17.530

Than there com Ladynas and Grastian, two knyghtes of Fraunse,
CMMALORY-M4,17.531

and dud passynge well, that all men praysed them.  CMMALORY-M4,17.532

Than com in sir Placidas, a good knyght, that mette with sir Kay and
smote hym downe horse and man, wherefore sir Gryfflet was wroth and
mette with sir Placidas so harde that horse and man felle to the erthe.
CMMALORY-M4,17.533

But whan the fyve knyghtes wyst that sir Kay had <P_18> a falle they
were wroth oute of mesure CMMALORY-M4,18.534

and therewithall ech of them fyve bare downe a knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,18.535

Whan kynge Arthur and the two kynges saw hem begynne wexe wroth on bothe
partyes, they leped on smale hakeneyes CMMALORY-M4,18.536

and lette cry that all men sholde departe unto theire lodgynge.
CMMALORY-M4,18.537

And so they wente home CMMALORY-M4,18.538

and unarmed them, CMMALORY-M4,18.539

and so to evynsonge and souper.  CMMALORY-M4,18.540

And aftir souper the three kynges went into a gardyne CMMALORY-M4,18.541

and gaff the pryce unto sir Kay and unto sir Lucas the Butler and unto
sir Gryfflet.  CMMALORY-M4,18.542

And than they wente unto counceyle, and with hem Gwenbaus, brothir unto
kynge Ban and Bors, a wyse clerke; CMMALORY-M4,18.543

and thidir wente Ulphuns, Brastias and Merlion.  CMMALORY-M4,18.544

And aftir they had $ben in her counceyle they wente unto bedde.
CMMALORY-M4,18.545

And on the morne they harde masse, CMMALORY-M4,18.546

and to dyner and so to theire counceyle, CMMALORY-M4,18.547

and made many argumentes what were beste to do.  CMMALORY-M4,18.548

So at the laste they were concluded that $Merlion sholde go with a
tokyn of kynge Ban, that was a rynge, unto hys men and kynge Bors;
CMMALORY-M4,18.549

Gracian and Placidas sholde go agayne and kepe their castels and theire
contreyes; CMMALORY-M4,18.550

and as for kynge Ban of Benwyke and kynge Bors of Gaule, $they had
ordayned them all thynge.  CMMALORY-M4,18.551

And so $they passed the see CMMALORY-M4,18.552

and com to Benwyke.  CMMALORY-M4,18.553

And whan the people sawe kynge Bannys rynge, and Gracian and Placidas,
they were glad CMMALORY-M4,18.554

and asked how theire kynge fared CMMALORY-M4,18.555

and made grete joy of their welfare.  CMMALORY-M4,18.556

And accordyng unto theire soveraigne lordis desire, the $men of warre
made hem redy in all haste possible, so that they were fyftene thousand
on horsebacke and foote, CMMALORY-M4,18.557

and they had grete plente of vitayle by Merlions provisions.
CMMALORY-M4,18.558

But Gracian and Placidas were leffte at home to furnysh and garnysh the
castell for drede of kyng Claudas.  CMMALORY-M4,18.559

Ryght so Merlion passed the see well vitayled bothe by watir and by londe.
CMMALORY-M4,18.560

And whan he com to the see he sente home the footemen agayne,
CMMALORY-M4,18.561

and toke no mo with hym but ten thousand men on horse-bake, the moste
party of men of armys; CMMALORY-M4,18.562

and $schipped CMMALORY-M4,18.563

and passed the see into Inglonde CMMALORY-M4,18.564

and londed at Dovir.  CMMALORY-M4,18.565

And thorow the wytte of Merlion he ledde the oste northwarde the
pryveyst wey that coude be thought, unto the foreste of Bedgrayne,
CMMALORY-M4,18.566

and there in a valey lodged hym secretely.  CMMALORY-M4,18.567

Than rode Merlion to Arthure and to the two kynges, CMMALORY-M4,18.568

and tolde hem how he had spedde, whereof they had grete mervayle that ony
man on erthe myght spede so sone to go <P_19> and com.  CMMALORY-M4,19.569

So Merlion tolde them how ten thousande were in the forest of Bedgrayne
well armed at all poyntis.  CMMALORY-M4,19.570

Than was there no more to sey, CMMALORY-M4,19.571

but to horsebak wente all the oste as Arthure had before provyded.
CMMALORY-M4,19.572

So with twenty thousand he passed by nyght and day.  CMMALORY-M4,19.573

$But there was made such an ordinaunce afore by Merlyon that there sholde
no man of warre ryde nothir go in no contrey on this syde Trente watir
but if he had a tokyn frome kynge Arthure, wherethorow the kynges enemyes
durst nat ryde as they dud tofore to aspye.  CMMALORY-M4,19.574

And so wythin a litill whyle the three kyngis com to the forest of
Bedgrayne CMMALORY-M4,19.575

and founde there a passynge fayre felyship and well besene, whereof they
had grete joy, and vitayle they wanted none.  CMMALORY-M4,19.576

Thys was the causis of the northir hoste, that they were rered
for the despite and rebuke that the $six kyngis had at Carlyon.
CMMALORY-M4,19.577

And tho six kyngis by hir meanys gate unto them fyve othir kyngis;
CMMALORY-M4,19.578

and thus they began to gadir hir people, CMMALORY-M4,19.579

and $now they swore nother for welle nothyr wo they sholde nat lyve tyll
they had destroyed Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,19.580

And than they made an othe, and the first that began the othe was the
deuke of $Canbenet, that he wolde brynge with hym $fyve thousand men of
armys, the which were redy on horsebakke.  CMMALORY-M4,19.581

Than swore kynge Brandegoris of Strangore that he wolde brynge with hym
fyve thousand men of armys on horsebacke.  CMMALORY-M4,19.582

Than swore kynge Clarivaus of Northumbirlonde <em> that he <$$em> wolde
brynge $three thousand men of armys with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,19.583

Than swore the Kynge with the Hondred Knyghtes that was a passynge good
man and a yonge, that he wold brynge four thousand good men of armys
on horsebacke.  CMMALORY-M4,19.584

Than there swore kynge Lott, a passyng good knyght and fadir unto sir
Gawayne, that he wolde brynge fyve thousand good men of armys on horsebak.
CMMALORY-M4,19.585

Also $ther swore kynge Uryens that was sir Uwaynes fadir of the londe
of Goore, CMMALORY-M4,19.586

and he wolde brynge six thousand men of armys on horsebak.
CMMALORY-M4,19.587

Also there swore kynge Idres of Cornuwaile that he wolde brynge fyve
thousand men of armys on horsebake.  CMMALORY-M4,19.588

Also there swore kynge Cradilmans to brynge fyve thousand men on
horsebacke.  CMMALORY-M4,19.589

Also there swore kyng Angwysshauns of Irelonde to brynge fyve thousand
men of armys on horsebak.  CMMALORY-M4,19.590

Also there swore kynge Nentres to brynge fyve thousand men on <P_20>
horsebak.  CMMALORY-M4,20.591

Also there swore kynge Carados to brynge fyve thousand men of armys
on horsebak.  CMMALORY-M4,20.592

So hir hole oste was of clene men of armys: CMMALORY-M4,20.593

on horscbacke was fully fyffty thousand.  and on foote ten thousand of
good mennes bodyes.  CMMALORY-M4,20.594

Than they were sone redy CMMALORY-M4,20.595

and mounted uppon horsebacke, CMMALORY-M4,20.596

and sente forthe before the foreryders.  CMMALORY-M4,20.597

For thes a eleven kynges in hir wayes leyde a sege unto the castell of
Bedgrayne; CMMALORY-M4,20.598

and so they departed CMMALORY-M4,20.599

and drew towarde Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,20.600

and leffte a fewe to byde at the sege, CMMALORY-M4,20.601

for the castell of Bedgrayne was an holde of kynge Arthurs
CMMALORY-M4,20.602

and the men that were within were kynge Arthurs men all.
CMMALORY-M4,20.603

So by Merlyons advice there were sente foreryders to skymme the contrey
; CMMALORY-M4,20.604

and they mette with the foreryders of the Northe CMMALORY-M4,20.605

and made hem to telle which way the oste com.  CMMALORY-M4,20.606

And than they tolde kynge Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,20.607

and by kynge Ban and Bors his counceile they lette brenne and destroy
all the contrey before them there they sholde ryde.  CMMALORY-M4,20.608

The Kynge of the Hondred Knyghtis that tyme mette a wondir dreme two
nyghtes before the batayle: that there blew a grete wynde and blew downe
hir castels and hir townys, CMMALORY-M4,20.609

and aftir that com a watir CMMALORY-M4,20.610

and bare hit all away.  CMMALORY-M4,20.611

And all that herde of that swevyn seyde hit was a tokyn of grete batayle.
CMMALORY-M4,20.612

Than by counceile of Merlion, whan they wyst which wey the an eleven
kynges wolde ryde and lodge that nyght, at mydnyght they sette uppon
them as they were in their pavilions.  CMMALORY-M4,20.613

But the scowte-wacche by hir oste cryed:'Lordis, to $armes!
CMMALORY-M4,20.614

for here be oure enemyes at youre honde! 'CMMALORY-M4,20.615

Than kynge Arthure and kynge Ban and Bors with hir good and trusty
knyghtes sette uppon them so fersely that he made them overthrowe hir
pavilions on hir hedis.  CMMALORY-M4,20.616

But the eleven kynges by manly prouesse of armys toke a fayre champion,
CMMALORY-M4,20.617

but there was slayne that morow tyde ten thousand good mennes bodyes.
CMMALORY-M4,20.618

And so they had before hem a stronge passage; CMMALORY-M4,20.619

yet were there fyffty thousand of hardy men.  CMMALORY-M4,20.620

Than hit drew toward day.  CMMALORY-M4,20.621

'Now shall ye do by myne advice,'seyde Merlyon unto the three kyngis ,
CMMALORY-M4,20.622

and seyde:'I wolde kynge Ban and Bors with hir felyship of ten thousand
men were put in a woode here besyde in an inbusshemente and kept them
prevy, and that they be leyde or the lyght of the day com, and that
they stire nat tyll that <P_21> ye and youre knyghtes $have fought with
hem longe.  CMMALORY-M4,21.623

And whan hit ys daylyght, dresse youre batayle evyn before them and the
passage, that they may se all youre oste, CMMALORY-M4,21.624

for than woll they be the more hardy whan they se you but aboute twenty
thousande, and cause hem to be the gladder to suffir you and youre oste
to com over the passage. 'CMMALORY-M4,21.625

All the three kynges and the hole barownes seyde how Merlion devised
passynge well, CMMALORY-M4,21.626

and so hit was done.  CMMALORY-M4,21.627

So on the morn whan aythir oste saw othir, they of the Northe were
well comforted.  CMMALORY-M4,21.628

Than Ulphuns and Brastias were delyvirde three thousand men of armys,
CMMALORY-M4,21.629

and they sette on them fersely in the passage, CMMALORY-M4,21.630

and slew on the ryght honde and on the lyffte honde that hit was wondir
to telle.  CMMALORY-M4,21.631

But whan the eleven kynges saw that there was so few a felyship that
dud such dedis of armys, they were ashamed CMMALORY-M4,21.632

and sette on hem agayne fersely.  CMMALORY-M4,21.633

And there was sir Ulphuns horse slayne, CMMALORY-M4,21.634

but he dud mervelously on foote.  CMMALORY-M4,21.635

But the duke $Estanse of $Canbenet and kynge Clarivaunce
of Northehumbirlonde were allwey grevously set on Ulphuns.
CMMALORY-M4,21.636

Than sir Brastias saw his felow yfared so withall, he smote the duke
with a spere, that horse and man felle downe.  CMMALORY-M4,21.637

That saw kyng Claryvauns, CMMALORY-M4,21.638

and $returned unto sir Brastias, CMMALORY-M4,21.639

and eythir smote othir so that horse and man wente to the erthe.
CMMALORY-M4,21.640

And so they lay longe astoned, CMMALORY-M4,21.641

and theire horse knees braste to the harde bone.  CMMALORY-M4,21.642

Than com sir Kay the Senesciall with six felowis with hym
CMMALORY-M4,21.643

and dud passynge well.  CMMALORY-M4,21.644

So with that com the eleven kyngis, CMMALORY-M4,21.645

and there was Gryfflette put to the erth horse and man, and Lucas the
Butler horse and man, $by kynge Brandegoris and kynge Idres and kynge

and horsed hym agayne.  CMMALORY-M4,21.651

Also sir Kay with the same spere smote downe kynge Lotte
CMMALORY-M4,21.652

and hurte hym passynge sore.  CMMALORY-M4,21.653

That saw the Kynge with the Hondred Knyghtes CMMALORY-M4,21.654

Whan sir Gryfflet saw sir Kay and sir Lucas de Butler on foote, he with

Than kynge Lotte smote downe Clarinaus de la Foreyste Saveage
CMMALORY-M4,22.673

'Gramercy,'seyde Ulphuns.  CMMALORY-M4,22.685

And whan Gryfflet saw rescowis he smote a knyght on the templis, that
hede and helme wente of to the erthe; CMMALORY-M4,23.706

and Gryfflet toke that horse CMMALORY-M4,23.707

and lad hym unto sir Lucas, CMMALORY-M4,23.708

and bade hym mownte uppon that horse and revenge his hurtis -
CMMALORY-M4,23.709

for sir Brastias had slayne a knyght tofore - CMMALORY-M4,23.710

and horsed sir Lucas.  CMMALORY-M4,23.711

Than sir Lucas saw kynge Angwysschaunce that $nyghe had slayne Maris de
la Roche; CMMALORY-M4,23.712

and Lucas ran to hym with a sherpe spere that was grete,
CMMALORY-M4,23.713

and he gaff hym suche a falle that the horse felle downe to the erthe.
CMMALORY-M4,23.714

Also Lucas founde there on foote Bloyas de la $Flaundres and sir Gwynas,
two hardy knyghtes; CMMALORY-M4,23.715

and in that woodnes that Lucas was in, he slew two bachelers
CMMALORY-M4,23.716

and horsed them agayne.  CMMALORY-M4,23.717

Than wexed the batayle passynge harde one bothe partyes.
CMMALORY-M4,23.718

But kynge Arthure was glad that hys knyghtes were horsed agayne.
CMMALORY-M4,23.719

And than they fought togiders, that the noyse and the sowne range by the
watir and woode.  Wherefore kynge Ban and Bors made hem redy and dressed
theire shyldis and harneysse, and were so currageous that their enemyes
shooke and byverd for egirnesse.  CMMALORY-M4,23.720

All thys whyle sir Lucas, Gwynas, Bryaunte, and Bellias of Flaundres helde
stronge medle agaynste six kynges, which were kynge Lott, kynge Nentres,
kynge Brandegoris, kynge Idres, kyng Uriens and kynge Angwysshauns.
CMMALORY-M4,23.721

So with the helpe of sir Kay and of sir Gryfflet they helde thes
six kyngis harde, that unneth they had ony power to deffende them.
CMMALORY-M4,23.722

But whan kynge Arthure saw the batayle wolde nat be ended by no manner,
he fared woode as a lyon CMMALORY-M4,23.723

and stirred his horse here and there on the ryght honde and on the
lyffte honde, that he stynted nat tylle he had slayne twenty knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,23.724

Also he wounded kynge Lotte sore on the shulder, CMMALORY-M4,23.725

and made hym to leve that grownde, CMMALORY-M4,23.726

for sir Kay with sir Gryfflet dud with kynge Arthure grete dedis of
armys there.  CMMALORY-M4,23.727

Than sir Ulphuns, Brastias and sir Ector encountirde agaynste the
<P_24> duke Estans and kynge Cradilmante and kynge Clarivauns of
North-humbirlonde and kynge Carados and the Kynge with the Hondred
Knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,24.728

So thes kynges encountird with thes knyghtes, that they made them to
avoyde the grounde.  CMMALORY-M4,24.729

Than kynge Lotte made grete dole for his damagis and his felowis,
CMMALORY-M4,24.730

and seyde unto the kyngis,'But if we woll do as I have devised, we all
shall be slayne and destroyed.  CMMALORY-M4,24.731

Lette me have the Kynge with the Hondred Knyghtes, and kynge
Angwysshaunce, and kynge Idres, and the duke of $Canbenet.  And we fyve
kyngis woll have ten thousand men of armys with us, CMMALORY-M4,24.732

and we woll go on one party whyle the six kynges holde the medle with
twelve thousand.  CMMALORY-M4,24.733

And whan we se that ye have foughtyn with hem longe, than woll we com
on freysshly; CMMALORY-M4,24.734

and ellis shall we never macche them,'seyde kynge Lotte,'but by thys
means. 'CMMALORY-M4,24.735

So they departed as they here devised, CMMALORY-M4,24.736

and thes six kyngis made theire party stronge agaynste kynge Arthure
CMMALORY-M4,24.737

and made grete warre longe in the meanwhyle.  CMMALORY-M4,24.738

Than brake the bushemente of kynge Banne and Bors; CMMALORY-M4,24.739

and Lionse and Phariaunce had that advaunte-garde, CMMALORY-M4,24.740

and they two knyghtes mette with kynge Idres <em> and his felauship,
CMMALORY-M4,24.741

and there began a grete medele of brekyng of speres and smytyng of
swerdes with sleynge of men and horses, <$$em> that <em> kynge Idres
<$$em> was nere discomfited.  CMMALORY-M4,24.742

That saw kynge Angwysshaunce, CMMALORY-M4,24.743

and put Lyonses and Phariaunce in poynte of dethe, CMMALORY-M4,24.744

for the duke <em> of Canbenet <$$em> com on with a grete felyship.
CMMALORY-M4,24.745

So thes two knyghtes were in grete daungere of their lyves, that they
were fayne to returne; CMMALORY-M4,24.746

but allweyes they rescowed hemselff and hir felyship merveylously.
CMMALORY-M4,24.747

Whan kynge Bors saw tho knyghtes put on bak hit greved hym sore.
CMMALORY-M4,24.748

Than he com on so faste that his felyship semed as blak as inde.
CMMALORY-M4,24.749

Whan kynge Lotte had aspyed kynge Bors, he knew hym well,
CMMALORY-M4,24.750

and seyde,'Jesu defende us from dethe and horryble maymes,
CMMALORY-M4,24.751

for I se well we be in grete perell of dethe; CMMALORY-M4,24.752

for I se yondir a kynge, one of the moste worshipfullyst <em> men, and
the <$$em> best knyghtes of the worlde be inclyned unto his felyship.
'CMMALORY-M4,24.753

'What ys he? 'seyde the Kynge with the $Hundirde Knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,24.754

'Hit ys,'he seyde,'kynge Bors of Gaule.  CMMALORY-M4,24.755

I mervayle,'seyde he,'how they com unto this contrey withoute wetynge
of us all. 'CMMALORY-M4,24.756

'Hit was by Merlions advice,'seyde a knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,24.757

<P_25>

'As for me,'seyde kynge Carados,'I woll encountir with kynge Bors ,
CMMALORY-M4,25.759

and ye woll rescow me whan myster ys. 'CMMALORY-M4,25.760

'Go on,'seyde they, CMMALORY-M4,25.761

'for we woll all that we may. 'CMMALORY-M4,25.762

Than kynge Carados and hys oste rode on a soffte pace tyll they com as
nyghe kynge Bors as a bowe-draught.  CMMALORY-M4,25.763

Than eythir lette theire horsys renne as faste as they myght.
CMMALORY-M4,25.764

And Bleobris that was godson unto kynge Bors, he bare his chyeff standard
; CMMALORY-M4,25.765

that was a passyng good knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,25.766

'Now shall we se,'seyde kynge Bors,'how thes northirne Bretons can bere
theire armys! 'CMMALORY-M4,25.767

So kynge Bors encountird with a knyght CMMALORY-M4,25.768

and smote hym throwoute with a spere, that he felle dede unto the erthe
; CMMALORY-M4,25.769

and aftirwarde drew hys swerde CMMALORY-M4,25.770

and dud mervaylous dedis of armys, that all partyes had grete wondir
thereof.  CMMALORY-M4,25.771

And his $knyghtes fayled nat CMMALORY-M4,25.772

but dud hir parte.  CMMALORY-M4,25.773

And kynge Carados was smytten to the erthe.  CMMALORY-M4,25.774

With that com the Kynge with the Hondred Knyghtes CMMALORY-M4,25.775

and rescowed kynge Carados myghtyly by force of armys, CMMALORY-M4,25.776

for he was a passynge good knyght and but a yonge man.  CMMALORY-M4,25.777

Be than com into the felde kynge Ban as ferse as a lyon, with bondis of
grene and thereuppon golde.  CMMALORY-M4,25.778

'A ha,'seyde kynge Lott,'we muste be discomfite, CMMALORY-M4,25.779

for yondir I se the moste valiante knyght of the worlde, and the man of
moste renowne, CMMALORY-M4,25.780

for such two brethirne as ys kynge Ban and kynge Bors ar nat lyvynge.
Wherefore we muste nedis voyde or dye, CMMALORY-M4,25.781

and but if we avoyde manly and wysely there ys but dethe. '
CMMALORY-M4,25.782

So wan thes two kyngis, Ban and Bors, com into the batayle, they com in so
fersely that the strokis $redounded agayne fro the woode and the watir.
Wherefore kynge Lotte wepte for pite and dole that he saw so many good
knyghtes take their ende.  CMMALORY-M4,25.783

But thorow the grete force of kynge Ban they made bothe the northirne
batayles that were parted hurteled togidirs for grete drede.
CMMALORY-M4,25.784

And the three kynges and their knyghtes slew on ever, that hit was pite to
se and to beholde the multitude of peple that fledde.  CMMALORY-M4,25.785

But kyng Lott and the Kynge with the Hundred Knyghtes and kynge Morganoure
gadred the peple togydir $passynge knyghtly, CMMALORY-M4,25.786

and dud grete proues of armys, CMMALORY-M4,25.787

and helde the batayle all the day lyke harde.  CMMALORY-M4,25.788

Whan the Kynge with the Hundred Knyghtes behelde the <P_26> grete damage
that kynge Ban $dyd he threste unto hym with his horse CMMALORY-M4,26.789

and smote hym an hyghe on the helme a grete stroke CMMALORY-M4,26.790

and stoned hym sore.  CMMALORY-M4,26.791

Than kynge Ban was wood wrothe with hym CMMALORY-M4,26.792

and folowed on hym fersely.  CMMALORY-M4,26.793

The othir saw that CMMALORY-M4,26.794

and caste up hys shelde CMMALORY-M4,26.795

and spored hys horse forewarde, CMMALORY-M4,26.796

but the stroke of kynge Ban downe felle CMMALORY-M4,26.797

and carve a cantell of the shelde, CMMALORY-M4,26.798

and the swerde sloode downe by the hawbirke byhynde hys backe
CMMALORY-M4,26.799

and kut thorow the trappoure of stele and the horse evyn in two pecis,
that the swerde felle to the erth.  CMMALORY-M4,26.800

Than the Kynge of the Hundred Knyghtes voyded the horse lyghtly,
CMMALORY-M4,26.801

and with hys swerde he broched the horse of kynge Ban thorow and thorow.
CMMALORY-M4,26.802

With that kynge Ban voyded lyghtly from the dede horse CMMALORY-M4,26.803

and smote at that othir so egirly on the helme that he felle to the erthe.
CMMALORY-M4,26.804

Also in that ire he felde kynge Morganoure, CMMALORY-M4,26.805

and there was grete slawghtir of good knyghtes and muche peple.
CMMALORY-M4,26.806

Be that tyme com into the prees kynge Arthure CMMALORY-M4,26.807

and founde kynge Ban stondynge amonge the dede men and dede horse,
fyghtynge on foote as a wood lyon, that there com none nyghe hym as
farre as he myght reche with hys swerde; CMMALORY-M4,26.808

but he caught a grevous buffette, whereof kynge Arthure had grete pite.
CMMALORY-M4,26.809

And kynge Arthure was so blody that by hys shylde there myght no man
know hym, CMMALORY-M4,26.810

for all was blode and brayne that stake on his swerde and on hys shylde.
CMMALORY-M4,26.811

And as kynge Arthure loked besyde hym he sawe a knyght that was passyngely
well horsed.  CMMALORY-M4,26.812

And therewith kynge Arthure ran to hym CMMALORY-M4,26.813

and smote hym on the helme, that hys swerde wente unto his teeth,
CMMALORY-M4,26.814

and the knyght sanke downe to the erthe dede.  CMMALORY-M4,26.815

And anone kynge Arthure toke hys horse by the rayne CMMALORY-M4,26.816

and ladde hym unto kynge Ban CMMALORY-M4,26.817

and seyde,'Fayre brothir, have ye thys horse, CMMALORY-M4,26.818

for ye have grete myster thereof, CMMALORY-M4,26.819

and me repentys sore of youre grete damage. 'CMMALORY-M4,26.820

'Hit shall be sone revenged,'seyde kynge Ban, CMMALORY-M4,26.821

'for I truste in God myne hurte ys none suche but som of them may sore
repente thys. 'CMMALORY-M4,26.822

'I woll welle,'seyde kynge Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,26.823

'for I se youre dedys full actuall; CMMALORY-M4,26.824

nevertheless I myght nat com to you at that tyme. 'CMMALORY-M4,26.825

But whan kynge Ban was mounted on horsebak, than there began a new
batayle whych was sore and harde, and passynge grete slaughtir.
CMMALORY-M4,26.826

And so thorow grete force kyng Arthure, kynge Ban, and kynge Bors
made hir knyghtes alyght to wythdraw hem to a lytyll <P_27> wood,
CMMALORY-M4,27.827

and so over a litill ryvir; CMMALORY-M4,27.828

and there they rested hem, CMMALORY-M4,27.829

for on the nyght before they had no grete reste in the felde.
CMMALORY-M4,27.830

And than the eleven kyngis put hem on an hepe all togydirs, as men adrad
and oute of all comforte.  CMMALORY-M4,27.831

But there was no man that myght passe them; CMMALORY-M4,27.832

they helde hem so harde togydirs bothe behynde and before that kynge
Arthure had mervayle of theire dedis of armys and was passynge wrothe.
CMMALORY-M4,27.833

'A, sir Arthure,'seyde kynge Ban and kynge Bors,'blame hem nat,
CMMALORY-M4,27.834

for they do as good men ought to do.  CMMALORY-M4,27.835

For be my fayth,'seyde kynge Ban,'they ar the beste fyghtynge men
and knyghtes of moste prouesse that ever y saw other herde off speke.
CMMALORY-M4,27.836

And tho eleven kyngis ar men of grete worship; CMMALORY-M4,27.837

and if they were longyng to you, there were no kynge undir hevyn that
had suche eleven kyngis nother off suche worship. 'CMMALORY-M4,27.838

'I may nat love hem,'seyde kynge Arthure,'CMMALORY-M4,27.839

for they wolde destroy me. 'CMMALORY-M4,27.840

'That know we well,'seyde kynge Ban and kynge Bors, CMMALORY-M4,27.841

'for they ar your mortall enemyes, CMMALORY-M4,27.842

and that hathe bene preved beforehonde.  CMMALORY-M4,27.843

And thys day they have done their parte, CMMALORY-M4,27.844

and that ys grete pite of their wylfulnes. 'CMMALORY-M4,27.845

Than all the eleven kynges drew hem togydir.  CMMALORY-M4,27.846

And than seyde Lott,'Lordis, ye muste do othirwyse than ye do,
CMMALORY-M4,27.847

othir ellis the grete losses ys behynde: CMMALORY-M4,27.848

for ye may se what peple we have loste and what good men we lese because
we wayte allweyes on thes footemen; CMMALORY-M4,27.849

and ever in savying of one of thes footemen we lese ten horsemen for hym.
CMMALORY-M4,27.850

Therefore thys ys myne advise: CMMALORY-M4,27.851

lette us putte oure footemen frome us, CMMALORY-M4,27.852

for hit ys nere nyght.  CMMALORY-M4,27.853

For thys noble kynge Arthure woll nat tarry on the footemen,
CMMALORY-M4,27.854

for they may save hemselff: CMMALORY-M4,27.855

the woode ys nerehonde.  CMMALORY-M4,27.856

And whan we horsemen be togydirs, looke every of you kyngis lat make such
ordinaunce that none breke uppon payne of deth.  And who that seeth any
man dresse hym to fle lyghtly, that he be slayne; CMMALORY-M4,27.857

for hit ys bettir we sle a cowarde than {it_is} thorow a coward all we
be slayne.  CMMALORY-M4,27.858

How sey ye? 'seyde kynge Lotte.  CMMALORY-M4,27.859

'Answere me, all ye kynges! 'CMMALORY-M4,27.860

'Ye say well,'seyde kynge Nentres.  CMMALORY-M4,27.861

So seyde the Kynge with the Hondred Knyghtes; CMMALORY-M4,27.862

the same seyde kynge Carados and kynge <P_28> Uryens; CMMALORY-M4,28.863

so seyde kynge Idres and kynge Brandegoris; CMMALORY-M4,28.864

so dud kyng Cradilmasse and the duke of $Canbenet; CMMALORY-M4,28.865

the same seyde kynge Claryaunce, CMMALORY-M4,28.866

and so dud kynge Angwysshaunce, CMMALORY-M4,28.867

and swore they wolde never fayle other for lyff nothir for dethe.
CMMALORY-M4,28.868

And whoso that fledde all they sholde be slayne.  CMMALORY-M4,28.869

Than they amended their harneyse CMMALORY-M4,28.870

and ryghted their sheldis, CMMALORY-M4,28.871

and toke newe speris CMMALORY-M4,28.872

and sette hem on theire thyghes, CMMALORY-M4,28.873

and stoode stylle as hit had be a plumpe of woode.  CMMALORY-M4,28.874

Whan kynge Arthure and kynge Ban and Bors behelde them and all hir
knyghtes, they preysed them much for their noble chere of chevalry , $for
the hardyeste fyghters that ever they herde other saw.  CMMALORY-M4,28.875

So furthwith there dressed a fourty knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,28.876

and seyde unto the three kynges they wolde breke their batayle.
CMMALORY-M4,28.877

And thes were their namys: Lyonses, Phariaunce, Ulphuns, Brastias, Ector,
Kayus, Lucas de Butler, Gryfflet la Fyse de Deu, Marrys de la Roche,
Gwynas de Bloy, Bryaunte de la Foreyste Saveage, Bellaus , Morians of the
Castel Maydyns, Flaundreus of the Castel of Ladyes, Annecians that was
kynge Bors godson, a noble knyght, and Ladinas de la Rouse, Emerause,
Caulas, Graciens le Castilion, Bloyse de la Case, and sir Colgrevaunce
de Goore.  CMMALORY-M4,28.878

All thes knyghtes rode on before with sperys on theire thyghes
CMMALORY-M4,28.879

and spurred their horses myghtyly.  CMMALORY-M4,28.880

And the eleven kyngis with parte of hir knyghtes rushed furthe as faste
as they myght with hir sperys, CMMALORY-M4,28.881

and there they dud on bothe partyes merveylous dedes of armys.
CMMALORY-M4,28.882

So there com into the thycke of the prees Arthure, Ban, and Bors,
CMMALORY-M4,28.883

and slew downeryght on bothe hondis, that hir horses wente in blood up
to the fittlockys.  CMMALORY-M4,28.884

But ever the eleven kyngis and the oste was ever in the visage of Arthure.
Wherefore kynge Ban and Bors had grete mervayle consyderyng the grete
slaughter that there was; CMMALORY-M4,28.885

but at the laste they were dryven abacke over a litill ryver.
CMMALORY-M4,28.886

With that Com Merlion on a grete blacke horse CMMALORY-M4,28.887

and seyde unto kynge Arthure,'Thou hast never done.  CMMALORY-M4,28.888

Hast thou nat done inow?  CMMALORY-M4,28.889

Of three score thousande thys day hast thou leffte on lyve but fyftene
thousand!  CMMALORY-M4,28.890

Therefore hit ys tyme to sey"Who! "CMMALORY-M4,28.891

for God ys wroth with the CMMALORY-M4,28.892

for thou woll never have done.  CMMALORY-M4,28.893

For yondir a eleven kynges at thys tyme woll nat be overthrowyn,
CMMALORY-M4,28.894

but and thou tary on them ony lenger thy <P_29> fortune woll turne
CMMALORY-M4,29.895

and they shall encres.  CMMALORY-M4,29.896

And therefore withdraw you unto youre lodgynge CMMALORY-M4,29.897

and reste you as sone as ye may, CMMALORY-M4,29.898

and rewarde youre good knyghtes with golde and with sylver,
CMMALORY-M4,29.899

for they have well deserved hit.  CMMALORY-M4,29.900

There may no ryches be to dere for them, CMMALORY-M4,29.901

for of so fewe men as ye have there was never men dud more worship-fully
in proues than ye have done to-day: CMMALORY-M4,29.902

for ye have macched thys day with the beste fyghters of the worlde.
'CMMALORY-M4,29.903

'That ys trouthe,'seyde kynge Ban and Bors.  CMMALORY-M4,29.904

Than Merlyon bade hem,'Withdraw where ye lyste, CMMALORY-M4,29.905

for thys three yere I dare undirtake they shall nat dere you;
CMMALORY-M4,29.906

and by that tyme ye shall hyre newe tydyngis. 'CMMALORY-M4,29.907

Than Merlion seyde unto Arthure,'Thes eleven kyngis have more on hande
than they are ware off, CMMALORY-M4,29.908

for the Sarezynes ar londed in their contreies mo than fourty thousande
, CMMALORY-M4,29.909

and brenne and sle CMMALORY-M4,29.910

and have leyde syege to the castell Wandesborow, CMMALORY-M4,29.911

and make grete destruction: CMMALORY-M4,29.912

therefore drede you nat thys yere.  CMMALORY-M4,29.913

Also, sir, all the goodis that be gotyn at this batayle lette hit be
serched, CMMALORY-M4,29.914

and whan ye have hit in your hondis lette hit be geffyn frendly unto thes
two kyngis, Ban and Bors, that they may rewarde their knyghtes wythall:
CMMALORY-M4,29.915

and that shall cause straungers to be of bettir wyll to do you servyse
at nede.  CMMALORY-M4,29.916

Also ye be able to rewarde youre owne knyghtes at what tyme somever hit
lykith you. 'CMMALORY-M4,29.917

'Ye sey well,'seyde Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,29.918

'and as thou haste devised so shall hit be done. 'CMMALORY-M4,29.919

Whan hit was delyverde to thes kynges, Ban and Bors, they gaff the godis
as frely to theire knyghtes as hit was gevyn to them.  CMMALORY-M4,29.920

Than Merlion toke hys leve of kynge Arthure and of the two kyngis,
for to go se hys mayster Bloyse that dwelled in Northumbir-londe.
CMMALORY-M4,29.921

And so he departed CMMALORY-M4,29.922

and com to hys mayster that was passynge glad of hys commynge.
CMMALORY-M4,29.923

And there he tolde how Arthure and the two kynges had spedde at the
grete batayle, and how hyt was endyd, CMMALORY-M4,29.924

and tolde the namys of every kynge and knyght of worship that was there.
CMMALORY-M4,29.925

And so Bloyse wrote the batayle worde by worde as Merlion tolde hym,
how hit began and by whom, and in lyke wyse how hit was ended and who
had the worst.  CMMALORY-M4,29.926

And all the batayles that were done in Arthurs dayes, Merlion dud hys
mayster Bloyse wryte them.  CMMALORY-M4,29.927

Also he dud wryte all the batayles that every worthy knyght ded of
Arthurs courte.  CMMALORY-M4,29.928

<P_30>

So aftir this Merlion departed frome his mayster CMMALORY-M4,30.930

and com to kynge Arthure that was in the castell of Bedgrayne, that
was one of the castels that stondith in the foreyste of Sherewood.
CMMALORY-M4,30.931

And Merlion was so disgysed that kynge Arthure knewe hym nat,
CMMALORY-M4,30.932

for he was all befurred in blacke shepis skynnes, and a grete payre of
bootis, and a boowe and arowis, in a russet gowne, CMMALORY-M4,30.933

and brought wylde gyese in hys honde.  CMMALORY-M4,30.934

And hit was on the morne aftir Candil-masse day.  CMMALORY-M4,30.935

But kynge Arthure knew hym nat.  CMMALORY-M4,30.936

'Sir,'seyde Merlion unto the kynge,'woll ye geff me a gyffte?
'CMMALORY-M4,30.937

'Wherefore,'seyde kynge Arthure,'sholde I gyff the a gyffte,
chorle? 'CMMALORY-M4,30.938

'Sir,'seyd Merlion,'ye were bettir to gyff me a gyffte that ys nat in
youre honde than to lose grete rychesse.  CMMALORY-M4,30.939

For here in the same place there the grete batayle was, ys grete tresoure
hydde in the erthe. 'CMMALORY-M4,30.940

'Who tolde the so, chorle? 'CMMALORY-M4,30.941

'Sir, Merlyon tolde me so,'seyde he.  CMMALORY-M4,30.942

Than Ulphuns and Brastias knew hym well inowghe CMMALORY-M4,30.943

and smyled.  CMMALORY-M4,30.944

'Sir,'seyde thes two knyghtes,'hit ys Merlion that so spekith unto
you. 'CMMALORY-M4,30.945

Than kynge Arthure was gretly abaysshed CMMALORY-M4,30.946

and had mervayle of Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,30.947

and so had kynge Ban and Bors.  CMMALORY-M4,30.948

So they had grete disporte at hym.  CMMALORY-M4,30.949

Than in the meanewhyle there com a damesell that was an erlis doughter;
CMMALORY-M4,30.950

hys name was Sanam CMMALORY-M4,30.951

and hir name was Lyonors, a passynge fayre damesell.  CMMALORY-M4,30.952

And so she cam thidir for to do omage as other lordis ded after that
grete batayle.  CMMALORY-M4,30.953

And kynge Arthure sette hys love gretly on hir, CMMALORY-M4,30.954

and so ded she uppon hym, CMMALORY-M4,30.955

and so the kynge had ado with hir CMMALORY-M4,30.956

and gate on hir a chylde.  CMMALORY-M4,30.957

And hys name was Borre, that was aftir a good knyght and of the Table
Rounde.  CMMALORY-M4,30.958

Than $ther com worde that kynge Ryens of North Walis made grete warre
on kynge Lodegreaunce of Camylarde, for the whiche kynge Arthure was
wrothe, CMMALORY-M4,30.959

for he loved hym welle CMMALORY-M4,30.960

and hated kyng Royns, CMMALORY-M4,30.961

for allwayes he was agenst hym.  CMMALORY-M4,30.962

<paren> So by ordinauns of the three kynges ther were sente home
unto Benwyke $all $that wolde departe, for drede of kynge Claudas.
CMMALORY-M4,30.963

Thes knyghtes: Pharyaunce, Anthemes, Graciens, <em> and Lyonses <$$em>
<P_31> Payarne were the leders of them that sholde kepe the two kynges
londis.  <$$paren> CMMALORY-M4,31.964

And than kynge Arthure, kynge Ban and kynge Bors departed with hir
felyship, a twenty thousand, CMMALORY-M4,31.965

and cam within seven dayes into the contrey of Camylarde;
CMMALORY-M4,31.966

and there rescowed kynge Lode-graunce, CMMALORY-M4,31.967

and slew there muche people of kynge Ryons, unto the numbir of ten
thousand, CMMALORY-M4,31.968

and putte hem to flyght.  CMMALORY-M4,31.969

And than had thes thre kynges grete chere of kynge Lodegraunce,
CMMALORY-M4,31.970

and he thanked them of theire grete goodnes that they wolde revenge hym
of his enemyes.  CMMALORY-M4,31.971

And there had Arthure the firste syght of queene Gwenyvere, the kyngis
doughter of the londe of Camylarde, CMMALORY-M4,31.972

and ever afftir he loved hir.  CMMALORY-M4,31.973

And aftir they were wedded, as hit tellith in the booke.
CMMALORY-M4,31.974

So breffly to make an ende, they took there leve to go into hir owne
contreyes, CMMALORY-M4,31.975

for kynge Claudas dud grete destruction on their londis.
CMMALORY-M4,31.976

Than seyde Arthure,'I woll go with you. 'CMMALORY-M4,31.977

'Nay,'seyde the kyngis,'ye shall nat at thys tyme, CMMALORY-M4,31.978

for ye have much to do yet in thys londe.  CMMALORY-M4,31.979

Therefore we woll departe.  CMMALORY-M4,31.980

With the grete goodis that we have gotyn in this londe by youre gyfftis
we shall wage good knyghtes and withstonde the kynge Claudas hys malice
, CMMALORY-M4,31.981

for, by the grace of God, and we have nede, we woll sende to you for

And ye have nede, sende for us, CMMALORY-M4,31.983

and we woll nat tarry, by the feythe of oure bodyes. ' CMMALORY-M4,31.984

'Hit shall nat nede,'seyde Merlion,'thes two kynges to com agayne in
the wey of warre; CMMALORY-M4,31.985

but I know well kynge Arthure may nat be longe frome you.
CMMALORY-M4,31.986

For within a yere or two ye shall have grete nede, CMMALORY-M4,31.987

than shall he revenge you of youre enemyes as ye have done on his.
CMMALORY-M4,31.988

For thes eleven kyngis shall dye all in one day by the grete myght and
prouesse of armys of two valyaunte knyghtes,'- as hit tellith aftir.
CMMALORY-M4,31.989

Hir namys $ben Balyne le Saveage and Balan, hys brothir, that were
merveylous knyghtes as ony was tho lyvynge.  CMMALORY-M4,31.990

Now turne we unto the eleven kynges that returned unto a cite that hyght
Surhaute, which cite was within kynge Uriens londe; CMMALORY-M4,31.991

and there they refreysshed them as well as they myght, CMMALORY-M4,31.992

and made lechys serche for their woundis CMMALORY-M4,31.993

and sorowed gretly for the deth of hir people.  CMMALORY-M4,31.994

So with that there com a messyngere CMMALORY-M4,31.995

and tolde how there was comyn into theyre londis people that were lawles
, as well as <P_32> Sarezynes a fourty thousande, and have brente and
slayne all the people that they may com by withoute mercy, and have
leyde sege unto the castell Wandesborow.  CMMALORY-M4,32.996

'Alas! 'seyde the eleven kyngis,'here ys sorow uppon sorow,
CMMALORY-M4,32.997

and if we had nat warred agaynste Arthure as we have done, he wolde sone
a revenged us.  CMMALORY-M4,32.998

And as for kynge Lodegreaunce, he lovithe Arthure bettir than us;
CMMALORY-M4,32.999

and as for kynge Royens, he hath ynow ado with kynge Lodegreauns,
CMMALORY-M4,32.1000

for he hath leyde sege unto hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,32.1001

So they condescended togydir to kepe all the marchis of Cornu-wayle,
of Walis, and of the Northe.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1002

So firste they put kynge Idres in the cite of Nauntis in Bretayne
with four thousand men of armys to wacche bothe watir and the londe.
CMMALORY-M4,32.1003

Also they <em> put in the cyte of Wyndesan kynge Nauntres of Garlott
with four thousand knyghtes to watche both on water and on lond.
CMMALORY-M4,32.1004

Also they <$$em> had of othir men of warre mo than eyght thousand
for to fortefye all the fortresse in the marchys of Cornuwayle.
CMMALORY-M4,32.1005

Also they put mo kyngis in all the marchis of Walis and Scotlonde with
many good men of armys, CMMALORY-M4,32.1006

and so they kept hem togydirs the space of three yere CMMALORY-M4,32.1007

and ever alyed hem with myghty kynges and dukis.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1008

And unto them felle kynge Royns of Northe Walis which was a myghty kynge
of men, and Nero that was a myghty man of men.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1009

And all thys whyle they furnysshed and garnysshed hem of good men of
armys and vitayle and of all maner of ablemente that pretendith to warre ,
to avenge hem for the $batayle of Bedgrayne, as hit tellith in the booke
of adven-tures.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1010

Than aftir the departynge of kynge Bans and Bors, kynge Arthure rode
unto the cite of Carlyon.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1011

And thydir com unto hym kynge Lottis wyff of Orkeney in maner of a
message, CMMALORY-M4,32.1012

but she was sente thydir to aspye the courte of kynge Arthure,
CMMALORY-M4,32.1013

and she com rychely beseyne with hir four sonnes, Gawayne, Gaheris
, Aggravayne and Gareth, with many other knyghtes and ladyes,
CMMALORY-M4,32.1014

for she was a pass-ynge fayre lady.  Wherefore the kynge caste grete
love unto hir and desired to ly by her.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1015

And so they were agreed, CMMALORY-M4,32.1016

and $he begate uppon hir sir Mordred.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1017

And she was syster on the modirs syde Igrayne unto Arthure.
CMMALORY-M4,32.1018

So there she rested hir a monthe, CMMALORY-M4,32.1019

and at the laste she departed.  CMMALORY-M4,32.1020

Than the kynge dremed a mervaylous dreme whereof he was sore <P_33> adrad.
CMMALORY-M4,33.1021

<paren> But all thys tyme kynge Arthure knew nat kynge Lottis wyff was
his sister.  <$$paren> CMMALORY-M4,33.1022

But thus was the dreme of Arthure: CMMALORY-M4,33.1023

hym thought there was com into hys londe gryffens and serpentes,
CMMALORY-M4,33.1024

and hym thought they brente and slowghe all the people in the londe;
CMMALORY-M4,33.1025

and than he thought he fought with them and they dud hym grete harme
and wounded hym full sore, CMMALORY-M4,33.1026

but at the laste he slew hem.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1027

Whan the kynge waked, he was passynge hevy of hys dreme;
CMMALORY-M4,33.1028

and so to putte hit oute of thought he made hym redy with many knyghtes
to ryde on huntynge.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1029

And as sone as he was in the foreste, the kynge saw a grete harte
before hym.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1030

'Thys harte woll I chace,'seyde kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1031

And so he spurred hys horse CMMALORY-M4,33.1032

and rode aftir longe, CMMALORY-M4,33.1033

and so be fyne force oftyn he was lyke to have smytten the herte.
Wherefore as the kynge had chased the herte so longe that hys horse
lost his brethe and felle downe dede, than a yoman fette the kynge
another horse.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1034

So the kynge saw the herte unboced and hys horse dede, CMMALORY-M4,33.1035

he sette hym downe by a fowntayne, CMMALORY-M4,33.1036

and there he felle downe in grete thought.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1037

And as he sate so hym thought he herde a noyse of howun-dis to the som
of thirty, CMMALORY-M4,33.1038

and with that the kynge saw com towarde hym the strongeste beste that
ever he saw or herde of.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1039

So thys beste wente to the welle CMMALORY-M4,33.1040

and dranke, CMMALORY-M4,33.1041

and the noyse was in the bestes bealy <em> lyke unto the questyng of
thirty coupyl houndes, CMMALORY-M4,33.1042

but alle the whyle the beest dranke there was no noyse in the bestes
bealy <$$em>.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1043

And there-with the beeste departed with a grete noyse, whereof the kynge
had grete mervayle.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1044

And so he was in a grete thought, CMMALORY-M4,33.1045

and therewith he felle on slepe.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1046

Ryght so there com a knyght on foote unto Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,33.1047

and seyde,'Knyght full of thought and slepy, telle me if thou saw any
stronge beeste passe thys way. 'CMMALORY-M4,33.1048

'Such one saw I,'seyde kynge Arthure,'that ys paste nye two myle.
CMMALORY-M4,33.1049

What wolde ye with that beeste? 'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1050

'Sir, I have folowed that beste longe and kylde myne horse,
CMMALORY-M4,33.1051

so wolde God I had another to folow my queste. 'CMMALORY-M4,33.1052

Ryght so com one with the kyngis horse.  CMMALORY-M4,33.1053

And whan the knyght saw the horse he prayde the kynge to gyff hym the
horse, CMMALORY-M4,33.1054

'for I have folowed this queste thys twelve-monthe, CMMALORY-M4,33.1055

and othir I shall encheve hym othir blede of the beste bloode in my body.
'CMMALORY-M4,33.1056

<paren> Whos name was <P_34> kynge Pellynor that tyme folowed the

and afftir hys dethe sir Palomydes folowed hit.  <$$paren>
CMMALORY-M4,34.1058

'Sir knyght,'seyd the kynge,'leve that queste and suffir me to have hit,
and I woll folowe hit anothir twelve-monthe. 'CMMALORY-M4,34.1059

'A, foole! 'seyde the kynge unto Arthure,'hit ys in vayne thy desire,
CMMALORY-M4,34.1060

for hit shall never be encheved but by me other by my nexte kynne.
'CMMALORY-M4,34.1061

And therewithe he sterte unto the kyngis horse CMMALORY-M4,34.1062

and mownted into the sadyl CMMALORY-M4,34.1063

and seyde,'Gramercy, for this horse ys myne owne. ' CMMALORY-M4,34.1064

'Well,'seyde the kynge,'thou mayste take myne horse by force,
CMMALORY-M4,34.1065

but and I myght preve hit I wolde weete whether thou were bettir worthy
to have hym or I. 'CMMALORY-M4,34.1066

Whan the kynge herde hym sey so he seyde,'Seke me here whan thou wolte ,
and here nye thys welle thou shalte fynde me,'CMMALORY-M4,34.1067

<em> and soo passed on hys weye.  CMMALORY-M4,34.1068

Thenne the kyng sat in a study <$$em> CMMALORY-M4,34.1069

and bade hys men fecche another horse as faste as they myght.
CMMALORY-M4,34.1070

Ryght so com by hym Merlyon lyke a chylde of fourtene yere of ayge
CMMALORY-M4,34.1071

and salewed the kynge CMMALORY-M4,34.1072

and asked hym whye he was so pensyff.  CMMALORY-M4,34.1073

'I may well be pensiff,'seyde the kynge,'CMMALORY-M4,34.1074

for I have sene the mervaylist syght that ever I saw. '
CMMALORY-M4,34.1075

'That know I well,'seyde Merlyon,'as welle as thyselff, and of all

But thou arte a foole to take thought for hit that woll nat amende the.
CMMALORY-M4,34.1077

Also I know what thou arte, and who was thy fadir, and of whom thou were

for kynge Uther was thy fadir CMMALORY-M4,34.1079

and begate the on Igrayne. 'CMMALORY-M4,34.1080

'That ys false! 'seyde kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,34.1081

'How sholdist thou know hit, CMMALORY-M4,34.1082

for thou arte nat so olde of yerys to know my fadir? ' CMMALORY-M4,34.1083

'Yes,'seyde Merlyon,'I know hit bettir than ye or ony man lyvynge.
'CMMALORY-M4,34.1084

'I woll nat beleve the,'seyde Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,34.1085

and was wrothe with the chylde.  CMMALORY-M4,34.1086

So departed Merlyon, CMMALORY-M4,34.1087

and com ayen in the lyknesse of an olde man of four score yere of ayge,
whereof the kynge was passynge glad, CMMALORY-M4,34.1088

for he semed to be ryght wyse.  CMMALORY-M4,34.1089

Than seyde the olde man,'Why ar ye so sad? 'CMMALORY-M4,34.1090

'I may well be sad,'seyde Arthure,'for many thynges.  CMMALORY-M4,34.1091

For ryght <P_35> now there was a chylde here, CMMALORY-M4,35.1092

and tolde me many thynges that $me $semythe {TEXT:mesemythe} he sholde

'Yes,'seyde the olde man,'the chylde tolde you trouthe,
CMMALORY-M4,35.1095

and more he wolde a tolde you and $ye wolde a suffirde hym.
CMMALORY-M4,35.1096

But ye have done a thynge late that God ys displesed with you,
CMMALORY-M4,35.1097

for ye have lyene by youre syster CMMALORY-M4,35.1098

and on hir ye have gotyn a childe that shall destroy you and all the

'What ar ye,'seyde Arthure,'that telle me thys tydyngis?
'CMMALORY-M4,35.1100

'Sir, I am Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,35.1101

and I was he in the chyldis lycknes. 'CMMALORY-M4,35.1102

'A,'seyde the kynge,'ye ar a mervaylous man!  CMMALORY-M4,35.1103

But I mervayle muche of thy wordis that I mou dye in batayle. '
CMMALORY-M4,35.1104

'Mervayle nat,'seyde Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,35.1105

'for hit ys Goddis wylle that youre body sholde be punyssed for your

But I ought ever to be hevy,'seyde Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,35.1107

'for I shall dye a shamefull dethe, to be putte in the erthe quycke;
CMMALORY-M4,35.1108

and ye shall dey a worshipfull dethe. 'CMMALORY-M4,35.1109

And as they talked thus, com one with the kyngis horse,
CMMALORY-M4,35.1110

and so the kynge mownted on hys horse, and Merlion on anothir,
CMMALORY-M4,35.1111

and so rode unto Carlyon.  CMMALORY-M4,35.1112

And anone the kynge askyd Ector and Ulphuns how he was begotyn,
CMMALORY-M4,35.1113

and they tolde hym how kynge Uther was hys fadir, and quene Igrayne

'So Merlion tolde me.  CMMALORY-M4,35.1115

I woll that my modir be sente for, that I myght speke with hir.
CMMALORY-M4,35.1116

And if she sey so hirselff, than woll I beleve hit. ' CMMALORY-M4,35.1117

So in all haste the quene was sente for, CMMALORY-M4,35.1118

and she brought with hir Morgan le Fay, hir doughter, that was a fayre

And the kynge welcommed Igrayne in the beste maner.  CMMALORY-M4,35.1120

Ryght so com in Ulphuns CMMALORY-M4,35.1121

'Sir, I am well ware,'seyde Ulphuns,'what I speke, CMMALORY-M4,35.1125

For the moste party of your barownes of youre realme knewe never whos

But,'thus she seyde,'Merlion knowith well, and ye, sir Ulphuns, how

And by his com-maundemente, whan the chylde was borne, hit was delyvirde

and kyssed her, CMMALORY-M4,36.1151

and eythir wepte uppon other.  CMMALORY-M4,36.1152

Than the kynge lete make a feste that lasted eyght dayes.
CMMALORY-M4,36.1153

So on a day there com into the courte a squyre on horsebacke ledynge a
knyght tofore hym, wounded to the deth, CMMALORY-M4,36.1154

and tolde how there was a knyght in the foreste that had rered up
a pavylon by a welle,'that hath slayne my mayster, a good knyght:
CMMALORY-M4,36.1155

hys name was Myles.  Wherefore I besech you that my maystir may be buryed,
and that som knyght may revenge my maystirs dethe.  'CMMALORY-M4,36.1156

Than the noyse was grete of that knyghtes dethe in the courte,
CMMALORY-M4,36.1157

<P_37>

and every man seyde hys advyce.  CMMALORY-M4,37.1159

Than com Gryfflet that was but a squyre, CMMALORY-M4,37.1160

and he was but yonge, of <em> the ayge of the kyng Arthur <$$em>.
CMMALORY-M4,37.1161

So he besought the kynge for all hys servyse that he had done hym to
gyff hym the Order of Knyghthoode.  CMMALORY-M4,37.1162

'Thou arte but yonge and tendir of ayge,'seyd kynge Arthure, 'for to
take so hyghe an $order uppon you. 'CMMALORY-M4,37.1163

'Sir,'seyde Gryfflett,'I beseche you to make me knyght.
'CMMALORY-M4,37.1164

'Sir,'seyde Merlion,'hit were pite'to lose Gryfflet, CMMALORY-M4,37.1165

for he woll be a passynge good man whan he ys of ayge, CMMALORY-M4,37.1166

and he shall abyde with you the terme of hys lyff.  CMMALORY-M4,37.1167

And if he aventure his body with yondir knyght at the fountayne, hit ys
in grete perell if ever he com agayne, CMMALORY-M4,37.1168

for he ys one of the beste knyghtes of the worlde and the strengyst man
of armys. 'CMMALORY-M4,37.1169

'Well,'seyde Arthure,'at thyne owne desire thou shalt be made
knyght. 'CMMALORY-M4,37.1170

<em> So at the desyre of Gryflet the kynge made hym knyght.  <$$em>
CMMALORY-M4,37.1171

'Now,'seyde Arthure unto Gryfflet,'sith I have made the knyght, thou
muste gyff me a gyffte. 'CMMALORY-M4,37.1172

'What ye woll,'seyde Gryfflet.  CMMALORY-M4,37.1173

'Thou shalt promyse me by thy feyth of thy body, whan thou haste justed
with that knyght at the fountayne, whether hit falle ye be on horsebak
othir on foote, that ryght so ye shall com agayne unto me withoute
makynge ony more debate. 'CMMALORY-M4,37.1174

'I woll promyse you,'seyde Gryfflet,'as youre desire ys.
'CMMALORY-M4,37.1175

Than toke Gryfflet hys horse in grete haste CMMALORY-M4,37.1176

and dressed hys shelde CMMALORY-M4,37.1177

and toke a spere in hys honde, CMMALORY-M4,37.1178

and so he rode a grete walop tylle he com to the fountain.
CMMALORY-M4,37.1179

And thereby he saw a ryche pavilion, CMMALORY-M4,37.1180

and thereby undir a cloth stood an horse well sadeled and brydyled,
CMMALORY-M4,37.1181

and on a tre hynge a shelde of dyvers coloures, and a grete spere thereby.
CMMALORY-M4,37.1182

Than Gryfflet smote on the shylde with the butte of hys spere, that the
shylde felle downe.  CMMALORY-M4,37.1183

With that the knyght com oute of the pavilion CMMALORY-M4,37.1184

and seyde,'Fayre knyght, why smote ye downe my shylde? '
CMMALORY-M4,37.1185

'Sir, for I wolde juste with you,'seyde Gryfflet.  CMMALORY-M4,37.1186

'Sir, hit ys bettir ye do nat,'seyde the kynge, CMMALORY-M4,37.1187

'for ye ar but yonge and late made knyght, CMMALORY-M4,37.1188

and youre myght ys nat to myne. 'CMMALORY-M4,37.1189

'As for that,'seyde Gryfflet,'I woll jouste with you. '
CMMALORY-M4,37.1190

<P_38>

'That ys me loth,'seyde the knyght, CMMALORY-M4,38.1192

'but sitthyn I muste nedis, I woll dresse me thereto.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1193

Of whens be ye? 'seyde the knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1194

'Sir, I am of kynge Arthurs courte. 'CMMALORY-M4,38.1195

So the two knyghtes ran togydir, that Gryfflettis spere all to-shevirde.
CMMALORY-M4,38.1196

And therewithall he smote Gryfflet thorow the shelde and the lyffte syde
, CMMALORY-M4,38.1197

and brake the spere, that the truncheon stake in hys body,
CMMALORY-M4,38.1198

and horse and man felle downe to the erthe.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1199

Whan the knyght saw hym ly so on the grounde he alyght CMMALORY-M4,38.1200

and was passyng hevy, CMMALORY-M4,38.1201

for he wente he had slayne hym.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1202

And than he unlaced hys helme CMMALORY-M4,38.1203

and gate hym wynde; CMMALORY-M4,38.1204

and so with the troncheon he sette hym on his horse CMMALORY-M4,38.1205

and gate hym wynde, CMMALORY-M4,38.1206

and so betoke hym to God CMMALORY-M4,38.1207

and seyde,'He had a myghty herte! 'CMMALORY-M4,38.1208

And seyde,'If he myght lyve, he wolde preve a passyng good knyght,
'CMMALORY-M4,38.1209

and so rode forthe sir Gryfflet unto the courte, whereof passyng grete
dole was made for hym.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1210

But thorow good lechis he was heled and saved.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1211

Ryght so com into the courte twelve knyghtes that were aged men, whiche
com frome the Emperoure of Rome.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1212

And they asked of Arthure trwage for hys realme, CMMALORY-M4,38.1213

othir ellis the Emperour wolde destroy hym and all hys londe.
CMMALORY-M4,38.1214

'Well,'seyde kynge Arthure,'ye ar messyngers: CMMALORY-M4,38.1215

therefore ye may sey what ye woll, CMMALORY-M4,38.1216

othir ellis ye sholde dye therefore.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1217

But thys ys myne answere: CMMALORY-M4,38.1218

I owghe the Emperour no trewage, CMMALORY-M4,38.1219

nother none woll I yelde hym, CMMALORY-M4,38.1220

but on a fayre fylde I shall yelde hym my trwage, CMMALORY-M4,38.1221

that shall be with a sherpe spere othir ellis with a sherpe swerde.
CMMALORY-M4,38.1222

And that shall nat be longe, be my fadirs soule Uther! '
CMMALORY-M4,38.1223

And therewith the messyngers departed passyngly wrothe, and kyng Arthure
as wrothe; CMMALORY-M4,38.1224

for in an evyll tyme com they.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1225

But the kynge was passyngly wrothe for the hurte of sir Gryfflet,
CMMALORY-M4,38.1226

and so he commaunded a prevy man of hys chambir that or hit were day his
beste horse and armoure'and all that longith to my person be with-oute
the cite'or tomorow day'.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1227

Ryght so he mette with his man and his horse, CMMALORY-M4,38.1228

and so mownted up, CMMALORY-M4,38.1229

and dressed his shelde CMMALORY-M4,38.1230

and toke hys spere, CMMALORY-M4,38.1231

and bade hys chambirlayne tary there tylle he com agayne.
CMMALORY-M4,38.1232

And so Arthure rode a soffte pace tyll hit was day.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1233

And than was he ware of thre chorlys chasyng Merlion CMMALORY-M4,38.1234

and wolde have slayne hym.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1235

Than the kynge rode unto them CMMALORY-M4,38.1236

and bade hem:'Fle, chorlis! 'CMMALORY-M4,38.1237

Than they fered sore whan they sawe a knyght com, CMMALORY-M4,38.1238

and fledde.  CMMALORY-M4,38.1239

<P_39>

'A, Merlion! 'seyde Arthure,'here haddist thou be slayne for all thy
crafftis, had nat I bene. 'CMMALORY-M4,39.1241

'Nay,'seyde Merlyon,'nat so, CMMALORY-M4,39.1242

for I cowde a saved myselffe and I had wolde.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1243

But thou arte more nere thy deth than I am, CMMALORY-M4,39.1244

for thou goste to thy dethe warde, CMMALORY-M4,39.1245

and God be nat thy frende. 'CMMALORY-M4,39.1246

So as they wente thus talkynge, they com to the fountayne and the ryche
pavilion there by hit.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1247

Than kynge Arthure was ware where sate a knyght armed in a chayre.
CMMALORY-M4,39.1248

'Sir knyght,'seyde Arthure,'for what cause abydist thou here that there
may no knyght ryde thys way but yf he juste with the?  CMMALORY-M4,39.1249

I rede the to leve that custom. 'CMMALORY-M4,39.1250

'Thys custom,'seyde the knyght,'have I used and woll use magre' who
seyth nay.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1251

And who that ys agreved with my custum lette hym amende hit. '
CMMALORY-M4,39.1252

'That shall I amende,'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1253

'And I shall defende the,'seyde the knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1254

And anone he toke hys horse, CMMALORY-M4,39.1255

and dressed hys shelde CMMALORY-M4,39.1256

and toke a grete spere in hys honde, CMMALORY-M4,39.1257

and they come togydir so harde that eythir smote other in mydde the
shyldis, that all to-shevird theire speris.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1258

Therewith anone Arthure pulled oute his swerde.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1259

'Nay, nat so,'seyde the knyght, CMMALORY-M4,39.1260

'hit ys bettir that we twayne renne more togydirs with sherpe sperys.
'CMMALORY-M4,39.1261

'I woll well,'seyde Arthure,'and I had ony mo sperys here.
'CMMALORY-M4,39.1262

'I have inow,'seyde the knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1263

So there com a squyre CMMALORY-M4,39.1264

and brought forthe two sperys, CMMALORY-M4,39.1265

and Arthure chose one and he another.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1266

So they spurred theire horsis CMMALORY-M4,39.1267

and come togydir with all theire myghtes, that eyther brake their sperys
to their hondis.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1268

Than Arthure sette honde on his swerde.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1269

'Nay,'seyde the knyght,'ye shall do bettir.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1270

Ye ar a passyng good juster as ever y mette withall, CMMALORY-M4,39.1271

and onys for the hyghe Order of Knyghthode lette us jouste agayne.
'CMMALORY-M4,39.1272

'I assente me,'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1273

And anone there was brought forth two grete sperys, CMMALORY-M4,39.1274

and anone every knyght gate a spere; CMMALORY-M4,39.1275

and therewith they ran togiders, that Arthures spere all to-shevirde.
CMMALORY-M4,39.1276

But this other knyght smote hym so harde in myddis the shelde that horse
and man felle to the erthe.  CMMALORY-M4,39.1277

<P_40>

And therewith Arthure was egir, CMMALORY-M4,40.1279

and pulde oute hys swerde, CMMALORY-M4,40.1280

and seyde,'I woll assay the, sir knyght, on foote, CMMALORY-M4,40.1281

for I have loste the honoure on horsebacke,'seyde the kynge.
CMMALORY-M4,40.1282

'Sir, I woll be on horsebacke stylle to assay the. ' CMMALORY-M4,40.1283

Than was Arthure wrothe CMMALORY-M4,40.1284

and dressed his shelde towarde hym with his swerde drawyn.
CMMALORY-M4,40.1285

Whan the knyght saw that he alyght, CMMALORY-M4,40.1286

for hym thought no worship to have a knyght at such avayle, he to be on
horsebacke and hys adversary on foote, CMMALORY-M4,40.1287

and so he alyght CMMALORY-M4,40.1288

and dressed his shelde unto Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1289

And there began a stronge batayle with many grete strokis,
CMMALORY-M4,40.1290

and so they hew with hir swerdis, that the cantels flowe unto the feldys
, CMMALORY-M4,40.1291

and muche bloode they bledde bothe, that all the place $there
$as {TEXT:thereas} they fought was ovirbledde with bloode.
CMMALORY-M4,40.1292

And thus they fought longe CMMALORY-M4,40.1293

and rested them.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1294

And than they went to the batayle agayne, CMMALORY-M4,40.1295

and so hurteled togydirs lyke too rammes that aythir felle to the erthe.
CMMALORY-M4,40.1296

So at the laste they smote togyders, that bothe hir $swerdys mette
evyn togyders.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1297

But kynge Arthurs swerde brake in two pecis, wherefore he was hevy.
CMMALORY-M4,40.1298

Than seyde the knyght unto Arthure,'Thou arte in my daungere, whethir
me lyste to save the or sle the; CMMALORY-M4,40.1299

and but thou yelde the to me as overcom and recreaunte, thou shalt dey.
'CMMALORY-M4,40.1300

'As for that,'seyde kynge Arthure,'dethe ys wellcom to me whan hit
commyth.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1301

But to yelde me unto the I woll nat! 'CMMALORY-M4,40.1302

And therewithall the kynge lepte unto kynge Pellynore, CMMALORY-M4,40.1303

and toke hym by the myddyll, CMMALORY-M4,40.1304

and overthrew hym, CMMALORY-M4,40.1305

and raced of hys helme.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1306

So whan the knyght felte that, he was adradde, CMMALORY-M4,40.1307

for he was a passynge bygge man of myght.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1308

And so forthewith he wrothe Arthure undir hym CMMALORY-M4,40.1309

and raced of hys helme, CMMALORY-M4,40.1310

and wolde have smytten off hys hede.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1311

And therewithall com Merlion CMMALORY-M4,40.1312

and seyde,'Knyght, holde thy honde, CMMALORY-M4,40.1313

for and thou sle that knyght thou puttyst thys realme in the gretteste
damage that {in} evir was realme: CMMALORY-M4,40.1314

for thys knyght ys a man of more worshyp than thou wotist off.
'CMMALORY-M4,40.1315

'Why, what ys he? 'seyde the knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1316

'For hit ys kynge Arthure,'seyde Merlyon.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1317

Than wolde he have slayne hym for drede of hys wratthe,
CMMALORY-M4,40.1318

and so he lyffte up hys swerde.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1319

And therewith Merlion caste an inchaunte-mente on the knyght, that he
felle to the erthe in a grete slepe.  CMMALORY-M4,40.1320

Than <P_41> Merlion toke up kynge Arthure CMMALORY-M4,41.1321

and rode forthe on the knyghtes horse.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1322

'Alas! 'seyde Arthure,'what hast thou do, Merlion?  CMMALORY-M4,41.1323

Hast thou slayne thys good knyght by thy craufftis?  CMMALORY-M4,41.1324

For there lyvith nat so worshipffull a knyght as he was.
CMMALORY-M4,41.1325

For I had levir than the stynte of my londe a yere that he were on lyve.
'CMMALORY-M4,41.1326

'Care ye nat,'seyde Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,41.1327

'for he ys holer than ye: CMMALORY-M4,41.1328

he ys but on slepe CMMALORY-M4,41.1329

and woll awake within thys owre.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1330

I tolde you,'seyde Merlyon,'what a knyght he was.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1331

Now here had ye be slayne had I nat bene.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1332

Also there lyvith nat a bygger knyght than he ys one; CMMALORY-M4,41.1333

and afftir this he shall do you goode servyse.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1334

And hys name ys kynge Pellinore, CMMALORY-M4,41.1335

and he shall have two sonnes that shall be passyng good men as ony
lyvynge: CMMALORY-M4,41.1336

save one in thys worlde they shall have no felowis of prouesse and of
good lyvynge, CMMALORY-M4,41.1337

and hir namys shall be Percyvall and sir Lamorake of Walis.
CMMALORY-M4,41.1338

And he shall telle you the name of youre owne son begotyn of youre syster,
that shall be the destruccion of all thys realme. ' CMMALORY-M4,41.1339

Ryght so the kynge and he departed CMMALORY-M4,41.1340

and wente unto an ermytage, CMMALORY-M4,41.1341

and there was a good man and a grete leche.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1342

So the ermyte serched the kynges woundis CMMALORY-M4,41.1343

and gaff hym good salves.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1344

And so the kyng was there three dayes, CMMALORY-M4,41.1345

and than wer his woundis well amended, that he myght ryde and goo;
CMMALORY-M4,41.1346

and so departed.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1347

And as they rode, kynge Arthur seyde,'I have no swerde. '
CMMALORY-M4,41.1348

'No force,'seyde Merlyon, CMMALORY-M4,41.1349

'hereby ys a swerde that shall be youre, and I may. ' CMMALORY-M4,41.1350

So they rode tyll they com to a laake that was a fayre watir and brode.
CMMALORY-M4,41.1351

And in the myddis Arthure was ware of an arme clothed in whyght samyte,
that helde a fayre swerde in that honde.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1352

'Lo,'seyde Merlion,'yondir ys the swerde that I spoke off.
'CMMALORY-M4,41.1353

So with that they saw a damesell goynge uppon the laake.
CMMALORY-M4,41.1354

<em>'What damoysel is that? 'said Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1355

'That is the Lady of the Lake,'<$$em> seyde Merlion.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1356

'There ys a grete roche, CMMALORY-M4,41.1357

and therein ys as fayre a paleyce as ony on erthe, and rychely besayne.
CMMALORY-M4,41.1358

And thys damesel woll come to you anone, CMMALORY-M4,41.1359

and than speke ye fayre to hir, that she may gyff you that swerde.
'CMMALORY-M4,41.1360

So anone com this damesel to Arthure CMMALORY-M4,41.1361

and salewed hym, and he hir agayne.  CMMALORY-M4,41.1362

<P_42>

'Damesell,'seyde Arthure,'what swerde ys that yondir that the arme
holdith aboven the watir?  CMMALORY-M4,42.1364

I wolde hit were myne, CMMALORY-M4,42.1365

for I have no swerde. 'CMMALORY-M4,42.1366

'Sir Arthure,'seyde the damesel,'that swerde ys myne, CMMALORY-M4,42.1367

and if ye woll gyff me a gyffte whan I aske hit you, ye shall have hit.
'CMMALORY-M4,42.1368

'Be my feyth,'seyde Arthure,'I woll gyff you what gyffte that ye woll

'Well,'seyde the damesell,'go ye into yondir barge, and rowe yourselffe
to the swerde, and take hit and the scawberde with you.  And I woll aske
my gyffte whan I se my tyme. 'CMMALORY-M4,42.1370

So kynge Arthure and Merlion alyght CMMALORY-M4,42.1371

and tyed their horsis unto two treys; CMMALORY-M4,42.1372

and so they wente into the barge.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1373

And whan they come to the swerde that the honde hylde, than kynge Arthure
toke hit up by the hondils CMMALORY-M4,42.1374

and bare hit with hym, CMMALORY-M4,42.1375

and the arme and the honde wente undir the watir.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1376

And so he com unto the londe CMMALORY-M4,42.1377

and rode forthe.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1378

And kynge Arthure saw a ryche pavilion.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1379

'What signifieth yondir pavilion? 'CMMALORY-M4,42.1380

'Sir, that ys the knyghtes pavilys that ye fought with laste, sir

but he ys oute.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1382

for he hath had ado with a knyght of youres that hyght Egglame,

and they had foughtyn togyddyr; CMMALORY-M4,42.1385

but at the laste Egglame fledde, CMMALORY-M4,42.1386

and ellis he had bene dede, CMMALORY-M4,42.1387

and he hath chaced hym evyn to Carlion.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1388

And we shall mete with hym anone in the hygheway. 'CMMALORY-M4,42.1389

'That ys well seyde,'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1390

'Now have I a swerde CMMALORY-M4,42.1391

I woll wage batayle with hym and be avenged on hym. ' CMMALORY-M4,42.1392

'Sir,'seyde Merlion,'nat so; CMMALORY-M4,42.1393

for the knyght ys wery of fyghtynge and chasynge, that ye shall have no

Also he woll nat lyghtly be macched of one knyght lyvynge,

Also ye shall se that day in shorte space that ye shall be ryght glad to

Therefore have nat ado with hym whan ye se hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,42.1400

'I woll do as ye avise me. 'CMMALORY-M4,42.1401

Than kynge Arthure loked on the swerde CMMALORY-M4,42.1402

and lyked hit passynge well.  CMMALORY-M4,42.1403

Than seyde Merlion, <P_43>'Whethir lyke ye better the swerde othir the
scawberde? 'CMMALORY-M4,43.1404

'I lyke bettir the swerde,'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1405

'Ye ar the more unwyse, CMMALORY-M4,43.1406

for the scawberde ys worth ten of the swerde; CMMALORY-M4,43.1407

for whyles ye have the scawberde uppon you, ye shall lose no blood,
be ye never so sore wounded.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1408

Therefore kepe well the scawberde allweyes with you. ' CMMALORY-M4,43.1409

So they rode unto Carlion; CMMALORY-M4,43.1410

and by the wey they mette with kynge Pellinore.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1411

But Merlion had done suche a crauffte unto kynge Pelli-nore saw nat
kynge Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,43.1412

and so passed by withoute ony wordis.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1413

'I mervayle,'seyde Arthure,'that the knyght wold nat speke.
'CMMALORY-M4,43.1414

'Sir, he saw you nat; CMMALORY-M4,43.1415

for had he seyne you, ye had nat lyghtly parted. 'CMMALORY-M4,43.1416

So they com unto Carlion, wherof hys knyghtes were passynge glad.
CMMALORY-M4,43.1417

And whan they herde of hys adventures, they mervayled that he wolde
jouparde'his person so alone.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1418

But all men of worship seyde hit was myrry to be under such a chyfftayne
that wolde putte hys person in adventure as other poure knyghtis ded.
CMMALORY-M4,43.1419

So thys meanewhyle com a messyngere frome kynge Royns of Northe Walis,
CMMALORY-M4,43.1420

and kynge he was of all Irelonde and of Iles.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1421

And this was hys message, gretynge well kyng Arthure on thys maner of
wyse, sayng that kynge Royns had discomfite and overcom eleven kyngis,
CMMALORY-M4,43.1422

and every of them dud hym omage.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1423

And that was thus to sey CMMALORY-M4,43.1424

they gaff theire beardes clene flayne off, as much as was
bearde; wherefore the messyngere com for kynge Arthures berde.
CMMALORY-M4,43.1425

For kynge Royns had purfilde a mantell with kynges berdis,
CMMALORY-M4,43.1426

and there lacked one place of the mantell; wherefore he sente for hys
bearde, CMMALORY-M4,43.1427

othir ellis he wolde entir into his londis and brenne and sle, and nevir
leve tylle he hathe the hede and the bearde bothe.  CMMALORY-M4,43.1428

'Well,'seyde Arthure,'thou haste seyde thy message, the whych ys the
moste orgulus and lewdiste message that evir man had isente unto a kynge.
CMMALORY-M4,43.1429

Also thou mayste se my bearde ys full yonge yet to make off a purphile.
CMMALORY-M4,43.1430

But telle thou thy kynge thus, that I owghe hym <em> none homage <$$em>
ne none of myne elders; CMMALORY-M4,43.1431

but or hit be longe to, he shall do me omage on bothe his knees,
CMMALORY-M4,43.1432

other ellis he shall lese hys hede, by the fayth of my body!
CMMALORY-M4,43.1433

For thys ys the moste shamefullyste message that ever y herde speke off.
CMMALORY-M4,43.1434

I have aspyed thy kynge never <P_44> yette mette with worshipfull man.
CMMALORY-M4,44.1435

But telle hym I woll have hys hede withoute he do me omage. '
CMMALORY-M4,44.1436

Than thys messyngere departed.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1437

'Now ys there ony here that knowyth kynge Royns? 'CMMALORY-M4,44.1438

Than answerde a knyght that hyght Naram,'Sir, I know the kynge well :
CMMALORY-M4,44.1439

he ys a passynge good man of hys body as fewe bene lyvynge and a passynge
proude man.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1440

And, sir, doute ye nat he woll make on you a myghty puyssaunce.
CMMALORY-M4,44.1441

'Well,'seyde Arthure,'I shall ordayne for hym in shorte tyme.
'CMMALORY-M4,44.1442

Than kynge Arthure lette sende for all the children that were borne in
May-day, begotyn of lordis and borne of ladyes; CMMALORY-M4,44.1443

for Merlyon tolde kynge Arthure that he that sholde destroy hym and all
the londe sholde be borne on May-day.  Wherefore he sente for hem all
in payne of dethe, CMMALORY-M4,44.1444

and so there were founde many lordis sonnys and many knyghtes sonnes,
CMMALORY-M4,44.1445

and all were sente unto the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1446

And so was Mordred sente by kynge Lottis wyff.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1447

And all were putte in a shyppe to the se; CMMALORY-M4,44.1448

and som were four wekis olde and som lesse.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1449

And so by fortune the shyppe drove unto a castelle, CMMALORY-M4,44.1450

and was all to-ryven and destroyed the moste party, save that Mordred
was cast up, CMMALORY-M4,44.1451

and a good man founde hym, CMMALORY-M4,44.1452

and fostird hym tylle he was fourtene yere of age, CMMALORY-M4,44.1453

and than brought hym to the courte, as hit rehersith aftirward and
towarde the ende of the MORTE ARTHURE.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1454

So, many lordys and barownes of thys realme were displeased
CMMALORY-M4,44.1455

for hir children were so loste; CMMALORY-M4,44.1456

and many putte the wyght on Merlion more than of Arthure.
CMMALORY-M4,44.1457

So what for drede and for love, they helde their pece.
CMMALORY-M4,44.1458

But whan the messynge com to the kynge Royns, than was he woode oute of
mesure, CMMALORY-M4,44.1459

and purveyde hym for a grete oste, as hit rehersith aftir in the BOOKE
OF BALYNE LE SAVEAGE that folowith nexte aftir: CMMALORY-M4,44.1460

that was the adventure how Balyne gate the swerde.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1461

<heading>

II.  CMMALORY-M4,44.1463

BALIN OR THE KNIGHT WITH THE TWO SWORDS CMMALORY-M4,44.1464

<$$heading>

Afftir the deth of Uther regned Arthure, hys son, which had grete warre
in hys dayes for to gete all Inglonde into hys honde; CMMALORY-M4,44.1466

<P_45>

for there were many kyngis within the realme of Inglonde and of Scotlonde
, Walys and Cornuwayle.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1468

So hit befelle on a tyme whan kynge Arthure was at London, ther com a
knyght and tolde the kynge tydyngis how the kynge Royns of Northe Walis
had rered a grete numbir of peple and were entred in the londe and brente
and slew the kyngis trew lyege people.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1469

'Iff thys be trew,'seyde Arthure,'hit were grete shame unto myne astate
but that he were myghtyly withstonde. 'CMMALORY-M4,45.1470

'Hit ys trouthe,'seyde the knyght, CMMALORY-M4,45.1471

'for I saw the oste myselff. 'CMMALORY-M4,45.1472

'Well,'seyde the kynge,'I shall ordayne to wythstonde hys malice.
'CMMALORY-M4,45.1473

Than the kynge lette make a cry that all the lordis, knyghtes and
jantilmen of armys sholde draw unto the castell called Camelot in tho
dayes, CMMALORY-M4,45.1474

and there the kynge wolde lette make a counceile generall and a grete
justis.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1475

So whan the kynge was com thidir with all his baronage and logged as
they semed beste, also there was com <em> a damoisel <$$em> the which
was sente frome the grete Lady Lyle of Avilion.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1476

And whan she com before kynge Arthure she tolde fro whens she com, and how
she was sente on message unto hym for thys causis.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1477

Than she lette hir mantell falle that was rychely furred,
CMMALORY-M4,45.1478

and than was she gurde with a noble swerde whereof the kynge had
mervayle and seyde,'Damesel, for what cause ar ye gurte with that swerde?
CMMALORY-M4,45.1479

Hit besemyth you nought. 'CMMALORY-M4,45.1480

'Now shall I telle you,'seyde the damesell.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1481

'Thys swerde that I am gurte withall doth me grete sorow and comberaunce
, CMMALORY-M4,45.1482

for I may nat be delyverde of thys swerde but by a knyght,
CMMALORY-M4,45.1483

and he muste be a passynge good man of hys hondys and of hys dedis, and
withoute velony other trechory and withoute treson.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1484

And if I may fynde such a knyght that hath all thes vertues he may draw
oute thys swerde oute of the sheethe.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1485

For I have bene at kynge Royns, CMMALORY-M4,45.1486

for hit was tolde me there were passyng good knyghtes; CMMALORY-M4,45.1487

and he and all his knyghtes hath assayde CMMALORY-M4,45.1488

and none can spede. 'CMMALORY-M4,45.1489

'Thys ys a grete mervayle,'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,45.1490

'If thys be sothe I woll assay myselffe to draw oute the swerde, nat
presumynge myselff that I am the beste knyght; CMMALORY-M4,45.1491

but I woll begynne to draw youre swerde in gyvyng an insample to all
the barownes, that they shall assay everych one aftir othir whan I have
assayde. 'CMMALORY-M4,45.1492

<P_46>

Than Arthure toke the swerde by the sheethe and gurdil CMMALORY-M4,46.1494

and pulled at hit egirly, CMMALORY-M4,46.1495

but the swerde wolde nat oute.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1496

'Sir,'seyd the damesell,'ye nede nat for to pulle halffe so sore ,
CMMALORY-M4,46.1497

for he that shall pulle hit oute shall do hit with litill myght.
'CMMALORY-M4,46.1498

'Ye sey well,'seyde Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1499

'Now assay ye all, my barownes. 'CMMALORY-M4,46.1500

'But beware ye be nat defoyled with shame, trechory, nother gyle,
CMMALORY-M4,46.1501

for than hit woll nat avayle,'seyde the damesel, CMMALORY-M4,46.1502

'for he muste be a clene knyght withoute vylony and of jantill strene
of fadir syde and of modir syde. 'CMMALORY-M4,46.1503

The moste parte of all the barownes of the Rounde Table that were there
at that tyme assayde all be rew, CMMALORY-M4,46.1504

but there myght none spede.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1505

Wherefore the damesel made grete sorow oute of mesure and seyde,'Alas!
I wente in this courte had bene the beste knyghtes of the worlde withoute
trechory other treson. 'CMMALORY-M4,46.1506

'Be my faythe,'seyde Arthure,'here ar good knyghtes as I deme as ony be
in the worlde, CMMALORY-M4,46.1507

but their grace ys nat to helpe you, CMMALORY-M4,46.1508

wherefore I am sore displeased. 'CMMALORY-M4,46.1509

Than hit befelle so that tyme there was a poore knyght with kynge
Arthure that had bene presonere with hym half a yere for sleyng of a
knyght which was cosyne unto kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1510

And the name of thys knyght was called Balyne, CMMALORY-M4,46.1511

and by good meanys of the barownes he was delyverde oute of preson,
CMMALORY-M4,46.1512

for he was a good man named of his body, CMMALORY-M4,46.1513

and he was borne in Northehumbirlonde.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1514

And so he wente pryvaly into the courte CMMALORY-M4,46.1515

and saw thys adventure whereoff hit reysed his herte, CMMALORY-M4,46.1516

and wolde assayde as othir knyghtes ded.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1517

But for he was poore and poorly arayde, he put hymselff nat far in prees.
CMMALORY-M4,46.1518

But in hys herte he was fully assured to do as well if hys grace happed
hym as ony knyght that there was.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1519

And as the damesell toke $her leve of Arthure and of all the barownes,
so departynge, thys knyght Balyn called unto her CMMALORY-M4,46.1520

and seyde,'Damesell, I pray you of youre curteysy suffir me as well to
assay as thes other lordis.  CMMALORY-M4,46.1521

Thoughe that I be pourely arayed yet in my herte $me $semyth
{TEXT:mesemyth} I am fully assured as som of thes other,
CMMALORY-M4,46.1522

and $me $semyth {TEXT:mesemyth} in myne herte to spede ryght welle.
'CMMALORY-M4,46.1523

Thys damesell than behelde thys poure knyght CMMALORY-M4,46.1524

and saw he was a lyckly man; CMMALORY-M4,46.1525

but for hys poure araymente she thought he sholde nat <P_47> be of no
worship withoute vylony or trechory.  CMMALORY-M4,47.1526

And than she seyde unto that knyght,'Sir, hit nedith nat you to put me
to no more payne, CMMALORY-M4,47.1527

for hit semyth nat you to spede $there $as {TEXT:thereas} all thes othir
knyghtes have fayled. 'CMMALORY-M4,47.1528

'A, fayre damesell,'seyde Balyn,'worthynes and good tacchis and also
good dedis is nat only in araymente, CMMALORY-M4,47.1529

but manhode and worship <em> ys hyd <$$em> within a mannes person;
CMMALORY-M4,47.1530

and many a worshipfull knyght ys nat knowyn unto all peple.
CMMALORY-M4,47.1531

And therefore worship and hardynesse ys nat in araymente. '
CMMALORY-M4,47.1532

'Be God,'seyde the damesell,'ye sey soth, CMMALORY-M4,47.1533

therefore ye shall assay to do what ye may. 'CMMALORY-M4,47.1534

Than Balyn toke the swerde by the gurdyll and shethe CMMALORY-M4,47.1535

and drew hit oute easyly; CMMALORY-M4,47.1536

and whan he loked on the swerde hit pleased hym muche.
CMMALORY-M4,47.1537

Than had the kynge and all the barownes grete mervayle that Balyne had
done that aventure; CMMALORY-M4,47.1538

many knyghtes had grete despite at hym.  CMMALORY-M4,47.1539

'Sertes,'seyde the damesell,'thys ys a passynge good knyght and the
beste that ever y founde, and moste of worship withoute treson, trechory,
or felony.  CMMALORY-M4,47.1540

And many mervayles shall he do.  CMMALORY-M4,47.1541

Now, jantyll and curtayse knyght, geff me the swerde agayne.
'CMMALORY-M4,47.1542

'Nay,'seyde Balyne,'for thys swerde woll I kepe but hit be takyn fro me
with force. 'CMMALORY-M4,47.1543

'Well,'seyde the damesell,'ye ar nat wyse to kepe the swerde fro me,
CMMALORY-M4,47.1544

for ye shall sle with that swerde the beste frende that ye have and the
man that ye moste love in the worlde, CMMALORY-M4,47.1545

and that swerde shall be youre destruccion. 'CMMALORY-M4,47.1546

'I shall take the aventure,'seyde Balyn,'that God woll ordayne for me.
CMMALORY-M4,47.1547

But the swerde ye shall nat have at thys tyme, by the feythe of my body!
'CMMALORY-M4,47.1548

'Ye shall repente hit within shorte tyme,'seyde the damesell,
CMMALORY-M4,47.1549

'for I wolde have the swerde more for youre avauntage than for myne;
CMMALORY-M4,47.1550

for I am passynge hevy for your sake, CMMALORY-M4,47.1551

for and ye woll nat leve that swerde hit shall be youre destruccion,
CMMALORY-M4,47.1552

and that ys grete pite`. 'CMMALORY-M4,47.1553

So with that departed the damesell CMMALORY-M4,47.1554

and grete sorow she made.  CMMALORY-M4,47.1555

And anone afftir Balyn sente for hys horse and armoure,
CMMALORY-M4,47.1556

and so wolde departe frome the courte, CMMALORY-M4,47.1557

and toke his leve of kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,47.1558

'Nay,'seyde the kynge,'I suppose ye woll nat departe so lyghtly <P_48>
from thys felyship.  CMMALORY-M4,48.1559

I suppose that ye ar displesyd that I have shewed you unkyndnesse.
CMMALORY-M4,48.1560

But blame me the lesse, CMMALORY-M4,48.1561

for I was mysseinfourmed ayenste you: CMMALORY-M4,48.1562

but I wente ye had nat bene such a knyght as ye ar of worship and

And if ye woll abyde in thys courte amonge my felyship, I shall so
avaunce $you as ye shall be pleased. 'CMMALORY-M4,48.1564

'God thanke youre Hyghnesse,'seyde Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,48.1565

'Youre bounte` may no man prayse halff unto the valew, CMMALORY-M4,48.1566

butt at thys tyme I muste nedis departe, besechynge you allway of youre

'Truly,'seyde the kynge,'I am ryght wroth of youre departynge.
CMMALORY-M4,48.1568

But I pray you, fayre knyght, that ye tarry nat longe frome me,
CMMALORY-M4,48.1569

and ye shall be ryght wellcom unto me and to my barownes,
CMMALORY-M4,48.1570

and I shall amende all mysse that I have done agaynste you. '
CMMALORY-M4,48.1571

'God thanke youre good grace,'seyde Balyn, CMMALORY-M4,48.1572

and therewith made hym redy to departe.  CMMALORY-M4,48.1573

Than the moste party of the knyghtes of the Rounde Table seyde that
Balyne dud nat this adventure $all $only by myght but by wycchecrauffte.
CMMALORY-M4,48.1574

So the meanwhyle that thys knyght was makynge hym redy to departe,
there com into the courte the Lady of the Laake, CMMALORY-M4,48.1575

and she com on horsebacke rychely beseyne, CMMALORY-M4,48.1576

and salewed kynge Arthure CMMALORY-M4,48.1577

and there asked hym a gyffte that he promysed her whan she gaff hym
the swerde.  CMMALORY-M4,48.1578

'That ys sothe,'seyde Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,48.1579

'a gyffte I promysed you, CMMALORY-M4,48.1580

but I have forgotyn the name of my swerde that ye gaff me. '
CMMALORY-M4,48.1581

'The name of hit,'seyde the lady,'ys Excalibir, CMMALORY-M4,48.1582

that ys as muche to sey as Kutte Stele. 'CMMALORY-M4,48.1583

'Ye sey well,'seyde the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,48.1584

'Aske what ye woll CMMALORY-M4,48.1585

and ye shall have hit and hit lye in my power to gyff hit. '
CMMALORY-M4,48.1586

'Well,'seyde thys lady,'than I aske the hede of thys knyght that hath
wonne the swerde, othir ellis the damesels hede that brought hit.
CMMALORY-M4,48.1587

I take no force though I have both theire hedis: CMMALORY-M4,48.1588

for he slew my brothir, a good knyght and a trew; CMMALORY-M4,48.1589

and that jantillwoman was causer of my fadirs death. ' CMMALORY-M4,48.1590

'Truly,'seyde kynge Arthure,'I may nat graunte you nother of theire
hedys with my worship; CMMALORY-M4,48.1591

therefore aske what ye woll els, and I shall fulfille youre desire.
'CMMALORY-M4,48.1592

'I woll aske none other thynge,'seyde the lady.  CMMALORY-M4,48.1593

So whan Balyn was redy to departe, he saw the Lady of the Lake <P_49>
which by hir meanys had slayne hys modir; CMMALORY-M4,49.1594

and he had sought hir three yere before.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1595

And whan hit was tolde hym how she had asked hys hede of kynge Arthure,
he wente to hir streyght CMMALORY-M4,49.1596

and seyde,'Evyll be $ye founde: CMMALORY-M4,49.1597

ye wolde have myne hede, CMMALORY-M4,49.1598

and therefore ye shall loose youres! 'CMMALORY-M4,49.1599

And with hys swerde lyghtly he smote of hyr hede before kynge Arthure.
CMMALORY-M4,49.1600

'Alas, for shame! 'seyde the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1601

'Why have ye do so?  CMMALORY-M4,49.1602

Ye have shamed me and all my courte, CMMALORY-M4,49.1603

for thys lady was a lady that I was muche beholdynge to,
CMMALORY-M4,49.1604

and hyder she com undir my sauffconduyghte.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1605

Therefore I shall never forgyff you that trespasse. ' CMMALORY-M4,49.1606

'Sir,'seyde Balyne,'me forthynkith of youre displeasure,
CMMALORY-M4,49.1607

for this same lady was the untrwyste lady lyvynge, CMMALORY-M4,49.1608

and by inchauntement and by sorcery she hath bene the destroyer of many
good knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,49.1609

and she was causer that my modir was brente thorow hir falsehode and
trechory. 'CMMALORY-M4,49.1610

'For what cause soever ye had,'seyde Arthure,'ye sholde have forborne
in my presence.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1611

Therefore thynke nat the contrary: CMMALORY-M4,49.1612

ye shall repente hit, CMMALORY-M4,49.1613

for such anothir despite had I nevir in my courte.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1614

Therefore withdraw you oute of my courte in all the haste that {in}
ye may. 'CMMALORY-M4,49.1615

Than Balyn toke up the hede of the lady CMMALORY-M4,49.1616

and bare hit with hym to hys ostry, CMMALORY-M4,49.1617

and there mette with hys squyre that was sory he had displeased kynge
Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,49.1618

and so they rode forthe oute of towne.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1619

'Now,'seyde Balyne,'we muste departe; CMMALORY-M4,49.1620

therefore take thou thys hede CMMALORY-M4,49.1621

and bere hit to my frendis CMMALORY-M4,49.1622

and telle hem how I have spedde, CMMALORY-M4,49.1623

and telle hem in Northhumbirlonde how my moste foo ys dede.
CMMALORY-M4,49.1624

Also telle hem how I am oute of preson, and what adventure befelle me
at the getynge of this swerde. 'CMMALORY-M4,49.1625

'Alas! 'seyde the squyre,'ye ar gretly to blame for to displease kynge
Arthure. 'CMMALORY-M4,49.1626

'As for that,'seyde Balyne,'I woll hyghe me in all $the haste that
{in} I may $to mete with kyng Royns and destroy hym, othir ellis to
dye therefore.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1627

And iff hit may happe me to wynne hym, than woll kynge Arthure be my
good frende. 'CMMALORY-M4,49.1628

'Sir, $wher shall I mete with you? 'seyde his squyre.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1629

'In kynge Arthurs courte,'seyde Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,49.1630

So his squyre and he <P_50> departed at that tyme.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1631

Than kynge Arthure and all the courte made grete dole CMMALORY-M4,50.1632

and had grete shame of the Lady of the Lake.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1633

Than the kynge buryed hir rychely.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1634

So at that tyme there was a knyght, the which was the kynges son of
Irelonde, CMMALORY-M4,50.1635

and hys name was Launceor, the which was an orgulus knyght and accompted
hymselff one of the beste of the courte.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1636

And he had grete despite at Balyne for the enchevynge of the swerde
, that ony sholde be accompted more hardy or more of prouesse,
CMMALORY-M4,50.1637

and he asked kynge Arthure licence to ryde afftir Balyne and to revenge
the despite that he had done.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1638

'Do youre beste,'seyde Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1639

'I am ryght wrothe with Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1640

I wolde he were quytte of the despite that he hath done unto me and my
courte. 'CMMALORY-M4,50.1641

Than thys Launceor wente to his ostre` to make hym redy.
CMMALORY-M4,50.1642

So in the meanewhyle com Merlyon unto the courte of kynge Arthure,
CMMALORY-M4,50.1643

and anone was tolde hym the adventure of the swerde and the deth of the
Lady of the Lake.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1644

'Now shall I sey you,'seyde Merlion; CMMALORY-M4,50.1645

'thys same damesell that here stondith, that brought the swerde unto youre
courte, I shall telle you the cause of hir commynge.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1646

She ys the falsist damesell that lyveth - CMMALORY-M4,50.1647

she shall nat sey nay!  CMMALORY-M4,50.1648

For she hath a brothir, a passyng good knyght of proues and a full trew
man, CMMALORY-M4,50.1649

and thys damesell loved anothir knyght that hylde her as paramoure.
CMMALORY-M4,50.1650

And thys good knyght, her brothir, mette with the knyght that helde hir
to paramoure, CMMALORY-M4,50.1651

and slew hym by force of hys hondis.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1652

And whan thys false damesell undirstoode this she wente to the lady Lyle
of Avylion CMMALORY-M4,50.1653

and besought hir of helpe to be revenged on hir owne brothir.
CMMALORY-M4,50.1654

'And so thys lady Lyle of Avylion toke hir this swerde that she brought
with hir, CMMALORY-M4,50.1655

and tolde there sholde no man pulle hit oute of the sheethe but yf he
be one of the beste knyghtes of thys realme, and he sholde be hardy and
full of prouesse; CMMALORY-M4,50.1656

and with that swerde he sholde sle hys brothir.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1657

Thys was the cause, damesell, that ye com into thys courte.
CMMALORY-M4,50.1658

I know hit as well as ye.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1659

God wolde ye had nat come here; CMMALORY-M4,50.1660

but ye com never in felyship of worshipfful folke for to do good, but
allwayes grete harme.  CMMALORY-M4,50.1661

And that knyght that hath encheved the swerde shall be destroyed thorow
the swerde; for the which woll be grete damage, CMMALORY-M4,50.1662

for there lyvith nat a knyght of more <P_51> prouesse than {of} he ys.
CMMALORY-M4,51.1663

And he shall do unto you, my lorde Arthure, grete honoure and kyndnesse
; CMMALORY-M4,51.1664

and hit ys grete pite` he shall nat endure but a whyle,
CMMALORY-M4,51.1665

for of his strengthe and hardinesse I know hym nat lyvynge hys macche.
'CMMALORY-M4,51.1666

So thys knyght of Irelonde armed hym at all poyntes CMMALORY-M4,51.1667

and dressed his shylde on hys sholdir CMMALORY-M4,51.1668

and mownted uppon horsebacke CMMALORY-M4,51.1669

and toke hys glayve in hys honde, CMMALORY-M4,51.1670

and rode aftir a grete pace as muche as hys horse myght dryve.
CMMALORY-M4,51.1671

And within a litill space on a mowntayne he had a syght of Balyne,
CMMALORY-M4,51.1672

and with a lowde voice he cryde,'Abyde, knyght!  CMMALORY-M4,51.1673

for ells ye shall abyde whethir ye woll other no.  CMMALORY-M4,51.1674

And the shelde that ys tofore you shall nat helpe you,'seyde thys Iryshe
knyght, CMMALORY-M4,51.1675

'therefore com I affter you. 'CMMALORY-M4,51.1676

'Peradventure,'seyde Balyne,'ye had bene bettir to have holde you at home.
CMMALORY-M4,51.1677

For many a man wenyth to put hys enemy to a rebuke, CMMALORY-M4,51.1678

and ofte hit fallith on hymselff.  CMMALORY-M4,51.1679

Oute of what courte be ye com fro? 'seyde Balyn.  CMMALORY-M4,51.1680

'I am com frome the courte of kynge Arthure,'seyde the knyght of
Irelonde,'that am com hydir to revenge the despite ye dud thys day unto
kynge Arthure and to his courte. 'CMMALORY-M4,51.1681

'Well,'seyde Balyne,'I se well I must have ado with you;
CMMALORY-M4,51.1682

that me forthynkith that I have greved kynge Arthure or ony of hys courte.
CMMALORY-M4,51.1683

And youre quarell ys full symple,'seyde Balyne,'unto me;
CMMALORY-M4,51.1684

for the lady that ys dede dud to me grete damage, CMMALORY-M4,51.1685

and ellis I wolde have bene lothe as ony knyght that lyvith for to sle
a lady. 'CMMALORY-M4,51.1686

'Make you redy,'seyde the knyght Launceor, CMMALORY-M4,51.1687

'and dresse you unto me, for that one shall abyde in the fylde.
'CMMALORY-M4,51.1688

Than they fewtred their spearis in their restis CMMALORY-M4,51.1689

and com togidirs as muche as their horsis $myght dryve.
CMMALORY-M4,51.1690

And the Irysh knyght smote Balyn on the shylde that all wente to shyvers
of hys spere.  CMMALORY-M4,51.1691

And Balyne smote hym agayne thorow the shylde, CMMALORY-M4,51.1692

and $the hawbirk perysshed, CMMALORY-M4,51.1693

and so bore hym thorow the body and over the horse crowper;
CMMALORY-M4,51.1694

and anone turned hys horse fersely CMMALORY-M4,51.1695

and drew oute hys swerde, CMMALORY-M4,51.1696

and wyst nat that he had slayne hym.  CMMALORY-M4,51.1697

Than he saw hym lye as a dede corse, CMMALORY-M4,51.1698

he loked aboute hym CMMALORY-M4,51.1699

and was ware of a damesel that com rydynge full faste as the horse myght
dryve, on a fayre palferey.  CMMALORY-M4,51.1700

And whan she aspyed that Launceor was slayne she made sorow oute of
mesure CMMALORY-M4,51.1701

and seyde, <P_52>'A!  Balyne, two bodyes thou haste <em> slain in <$$em>
one herte, and two hertes in one body, CMMALORY-M4,52.1702

and two soules thou hast loste. 'CMMALORY-M4,52.1703

And therewith she toke the swerde frome hir love that lay dede,
CMMALORY-M4,52.1704

and felle to the grounde in a swowghe.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1705

And whan she arose she made grete dole oute of mesure, which sorow greved
Balyn passyngly sore.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1706

And he wente unto hir for to have tane the swerde oute of hir honde;
CMMALORY-M4,52.1707

but she helde hit so faste he myght nat take hit oute of hir honde but
yf he sholde have hurte hir.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1708

And suddeynly she sette the pomell to the grounde, CMMALORY-M4,52.1709

and rove hirselff thorowoute the body.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1710

Whan Balyne aspyed hir dedis he was passynge hevy in his herte and ashamed
that so fayre a damesell had destroyed hirselff for the love of hys dethe.
CMMALORY-M4,52.1711

'Alas! 'seyde Balyn,'me repentis sore the dethe of thys knyght for the
love of thys damesel, CMMALORY-M4,52.1712

for there was muche trw love betwyxte hem. 'CMMALORY-M4,52.1713

And so for sorow he myght no lenger beholde them, CMMALORY-M4,52.1714

but turned hys horse CMMALORY-M4,52.1715

and loked towarde a fayre foreste.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1716

And than was he ware by hys armys that there com rydyng hys brothir Balan.
CMMALORY-M4,52.1717

And whan they were mette they put of hyr helmys CMMALORY-M4,52.1718

and kyssed togydirs CMMALORY-M4,52.1719

and wepte for joy and pite`.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1720

Than Balan seyde,'Brothir, I litill wende to have mette with you at thys
suddayne adventure, CMMALORY-M4,52.1721

but I am ryght glad of youre delyveraunce of youre dolerous presonment:
CMMALORY-M4,52.1722

for a man tolde me in the Castell of Four Stonys that ye were delyverde
, CMMALORY-M4,52.1723

and that man had seyne you in the courte of kynge Arthure.
CMMALORY-M4,52.1724

And therefore I com hydir into thys contrey, CMMALORY-M4,52.1725

for here I supposed to fynde you. 'CMMALORY-M4,52.1726

And anone Balyne tolde hys brothir of hys adventure of the swerde and the
deth of the Lady of the Laake, and how kynge Arthure was displeased with
hym. 'Wherefore he sente thys knyght afftir me that lyethe here dede.
CMMALORY-M4,52.1727

And the dethe of thys damesell grevith me sore. 'CMMALORY-M4,52.1728

'So doth hit me,'seyde Balan.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1729

'But ye must take the adventure that God woll ordayne you. '
CMMALORY-M4,52.1730

'Truly,'seyde Balyne,'I am ryght hevy that my lorde Arthure ys displeased
with me, CMMALORY-M4,52.1731

for he ys the moste worshypfullist kynge that regnith now in erthe;
CMMALORY-M4,52.1732

and hys love I woll gete CMMALORY-M4,52.1733

othir ellis I woll putte my lyff in adventure.  CMMALORY-M4,52.1734

For kynge Ryons lyeth at the sege of the Castell Terrable,
CMMALORY-M4,52.1735

and thydir woll we draw in all goodly haste to preve oure worship and
prouesse uppon hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,52.1736

<P_53>

'I woll well,'seyde Balan,'that ye so do; CMMALORY-M4,53.1738

and I woll ryde with you and put my body in adventure with you, as a
brothir ought to do. 'CMMALORY-M4,53.1739

'Now go we hense,'seyde Balyne, CMMALORY-M4,53.1740

'and well we beth mette. 'CMMALORY-M4,53.1741

The meanewhyle as they talked there com a dwarff frome the cite` of
Camelot on horsebacke as much as he myght, CMMALORY-M4,53.1742

and founde the dede bodyes; wherefore he made grete dole
CMMALORY-M4,53.1743

and he pulled hys heyre for sorowe CMMALORY-M4,53.1744

and seyde,'Which of two knyghtes have done this dede? '
CMMALORY-M4,53.1745

'Whereby askist thou? 'seyde Balan.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1746

'For I wolde wete,'seyde the dwarff.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1747

'Hit was I,'seyde Balyn,'that slew this knyght in my defendaunte ;
CMMALORY-M4,53.1748

for hyder he com to chase me, CMMALORY-M4,53.1749

and othir I muste sle hym other he me.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1750

And this damesell slew hirself for his love, which repentith me.
CMMALORY-M4,53.1751

And for hir sake I shall owghe all women the bettir wylle and servyse
all the dayes of my lyff. 'CMMALORY-M4,53.1752

'Alas! 'seyde the dwarff,'thou hast done grete damage unto thyselff.
CMMALORY-M4,53.1753

For thys knyght that ys here dede was one of the moste valyauntis men
that lyved.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1754

And truste well, Balyne, the kynne of thys knyght woll chase you thorow
the worlde tylle they have slayne you. 'CMMALORY-M4,53.1755

'As for that,'seyde Balyne,'the I fere nat gretely; CMMALORY-M4,53.1756

but I am ryght hevy that I sholde displease my lorde, kynge Arthure,
for the deth of thys knyght. 'CMMALORY-M4,53.1757

So as they talked togydirs there com a kynge of Cornuwayle rydyng,
which hyght kyng Marke.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1758

And whan he saw thes two bodyes dede, and undirstood howe they were dede,
$by the two knyghtes aboven-seyde, $thenne made the kynge grete sorow
for the trew love that was betwyxte them, CMMALORY-M4,53.1759

and seyde,'I woll nat departe tyll I have on thys erth made a towmbe.
'CMMALORY-M4,53.1760

And there he pyght his pavylyons CMMALORY-M4,53.1761

and sought all the contrey to fynde a towmbe, CMMALORY-M4,53.1762

and in a chirch they founde one was fayre and ryche.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1763

And than the kyng lette putte $hem bothe in the erthe, CMMALORY-M4,53.1764

and leyde the tombe uppon them, CMMALORY-M4,53.1765

and wrote the namys of hem bothe on the tombe, how'here lyeth Launceor ,
the kyngis son of Irelonde, that at hys owne rekeyste was slayne by the
hondis of Balyne,'and how'this lady Columbe and peramour to hym slew
hirself with hys swerde for dole and sorow.  CMMALORY-M4,53.1766

<P_54>

The meanewhyle as thys was adoynge, in com Merlion to kynge Marke
CMMALORY-M4,54.1768

and saw all thys doynge.  CMMALORY-M4,54.1769

'Here shall be,'seyde Merlion,'in this same place the grettist bateyle

lovers; CMMALORY-M4,54.1770

and yette none of hem shall slee other. 'CMMALORY-M4,54.1771

And there Merlion wrote hir namys uppon the tombe with lettirs of golde,
that shall feyght in that place: which namys was Laucelot du Lake and
Trystrams.  CMMALORY-M4,54.1772

'Thou $art a merveylous man,'seyde kynge Marke unto Merlion, 'that

Thou arte a boysteous man and an unlyckly, to telle of suche dedis.
CMMALORY-M4,54.1774

What ys thy name? 'seyde kynge Marke.  CMMALORY-M4,54.1775

'At thys tyme,'seyde Merlion,'I woll nat telle. ' CMMALORY-M4,54.1776

{COM:part_of_line_missing?} tyme sir Trystrams ys takyn with his

than shall ye here and know my name; CMMALORY-M4,54.1778

and at that tyme ye shall $here tydynges that shall nat please you.
'CMMALORY-M4,54.1779

'A, Balyne! 'seyde Merlion,'thou haste done thyselff grete hurte that
thou saved nat thys lady that slew herselff; CMMALORY-M4,54.1780

for thou myghtyst have saved hir and thou haddist wold. '
CMMALORY-M4,54.1781

'By the fayth of my body,'seyde Merlion,'I myght nat save hir,
CMMALORY-M4,54.1782

for she slewe hirselff suddeynly. 'CMMALORY-M4,54.1783

'Me repentis hit,'seyde Merlion; CMMALORY-M4,54.1784

'because of the dethe of that lady thou shalt stryke a stroke moste
dolerous that ever man stroke, excepte the stroke of oure Lorde Jesu
Cryste.  CMMALORY-M4,54.1785

For thou shalt hurte the trewyst knyght and the man of moste worship
that now lyvith; CMMALORY-M4,54.1786

and thorow that stroke, three kyngdomys shall be brought into grete
poverte', miseri and wrecchednesse twelve yere.  CMMALORY-M4,54.1787

And the knyght shall nat be hole of that wounde many yerys. '
CMMALORY-M4,54.1788

Than Merlion toke hys leve.  CMMALORY-M4,54.1789

'Nay,'seyde Balyn,'nat so; CMMALORY-M4,54.1790

for and I wyste thou seyde soth, I wolde do so perleous a dede that I
wolde sle myself to make the a lyer. 'CMMALORY-M4,54.1791

Therewith Merlion vanyssed away suddeynly, CMMALORY-M4,54.1792

and than Balyn and his brother toke their leve of kynge Marke.
CMMALORY-M4,54.1793

'But first,'seyde the kynge,'telle me youre name. ' CMMALORY-M4,54.1794

'Sir,'seyde Balan,'ye may se he beryth two swerdis and thereby ye may
calle hym the Knyght with the Two Swerdis. 'CMMALORY-M4,54.1795

<P_55>

And so departed kynge Marke unto Camelot to kynge Arthure.
CMMALORY-M4,55.1797

And Balyne toke the way to kynge Royns, CMMALORY-M4,55.1798

and as they rode togydir they mette with Merlion disgysed so that they
knew hym nought.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1799

'But whotherward ryde ye? 'seyde Merlion.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1800

'We had litill ado to telle you,'seyde thes two knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,55.1801

'But what ys thy name? 'seyde Balyn.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1802

'At thys tyme,'seyde Merlion,'I woll nat telle. ' CMMALORY-M4,55.1803

'Hit ys an evyll sygne,'seyde the knyghtes,'that thou arte a trew man,
that thou wolt nat telle thy name. 'CMMALORY-M4,55.1804

'As for that,'seyde Merlion,'be as hit be may.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1805

But I can telle you wherefore ye ryde thys way: CMMALORY-M4,55.1806

for to mete with kynge Royns.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1807

But hit woll nat avayle you withoute ye have my counceyle. '
CMMALORY-M4,55.1808

'A,'seyde Balyn,'ye ar Merlion.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1809

We woll be ruled by youre counceyle. 'CMMALORY-M4,55.1810

'Com on,'seyde Merlion,'and ye shall have grete worship.
CMMALORY-M4,55.1811

And loke that ye do knyghtly, CMMALORY-M4,55.1812

for ye shall have nede. 'CMMALORY-M4,55.1813

'As for that,'seyde Balyne,'dred you nat, CMMALORY-M4,55.1814

for we woll do what we may. 'CMMALORY-M4,55.1815

Than there lodged Merlion and thes two knyghtes in a woode amonge the
levis besydes the hyghway, CMMALORY-M4,55.1816

and toke of the brydyls of their horsis CMMALORY-M4,55.1817

and putte hem to grasse, CMMALORY-M4,55.1818

and leyde hem downe to reste tyll hit was nyghe mydnyght.
CMMALORY-M4,55.1819

Than Merlion bade hem ryse and make hem redy: CMMALORY-M4,55.1820

'for here commyth the kynge nyghehonde, that was stoolyn away frome his

and twenty of them rode tofore the lorde to warne the Lady de Vaunce
that the kynge was commynge. 'CMMALORY-M4,55.1822

For that nyght kynge Royns sholde have lyen with hir.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1823

'Which ys the kynge? 'seyde Balyn.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1824

'Abyde,'seyde Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,55.1825

'for here in a strete $weye ye shall mete with hym. ' CMMALORY-M4,55.1826

And therewith he shewed Balyn and hys brothir the kynge.
CMMALORY-M4,55.1827

And anone they mette with hym, CMMALORY-M4,55.1828

and smote hym downe CMMALORY-M4,55.1829

and wounded hym freyshly, CMMALORY-M4,55.1830

and layde hym to the growunde.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1831

And there they slewe on the ryght honde and on the lyffte honde mo than
fourty of hys men; CMMALORY-M4,55.1832

and the remanaunte fledde.  CMMALORY-M4,55.1833

Than wente they agayne unto kynge Royns CMMALORY-M4,55.1834

and wold have slayne hym, had he nat yelded hym unto hir grace.
CMMALORY-M4,55.1835

Than seyde he thus: CMMALORY-M4,55.1836

<P_56>

'Knyghtes full of prouesse, sle me nat!  CMMALORY-M4,56.1838

For be my lyff ye may wynne, and by my dethe litill. ' CMMALORY-M4,56.1839

'Ye say sothe,'seyde the knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,56.1840

and so leyde hym on an horse littur CMMALORY-M4,56.1841

So with that Merlion vanysshed, CMMALORY-M4,56.1842

and com to kynge Arthure aforehonde CMMALORY-M4,56.1843

and tolde hym how hys moste enemy was takyn and discomfite
CMMALORY-M4,56.1844

'By whom? 'seyde kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1845

'By two knyghtes,'seyde Merlion,'that wolde fayne have youre lordship.
CMMALORY-M4,56.1846

And to-morrow ye shall know what knyghtis they ar. 'CMMALORY-M4,56.1847

So anone aftir com the Knyght with the Two Swerdis and hys brothir,
CMMALORY-M4,56.1848

and brought with them kynge Royns of Northe Waalis, CMMALORY-M4,56.1849

and there delyverde hym to the porters, CMMALORY-M4,56.1850

and charged hem with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1851

And so they two returned agen in the dawnyng of the day.
CMMALORY-M4,56.1852

Than kynge Arthure com to kynge Royns CMMALORY-M4,56.1853

and seyde,'Sir kynge, ye ar wellcom.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1854

By what adventure com ye hydir? 'CMMALORY-M4,56.1855

'Sir,'seyde kynge Royns,'I com hyder by an harde adventure.
'CMMALORY-M4,56.1856

'Who wanne you? 'seyde kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1857

'Sir,'seyde he,'the Knyght with the Two Swerdis and hys brothir, which
ar two mervayles knyghtes of prouesse. 'CMMALORY-M4,56.1858

'I know hem nat,'seyde Arthure CMMALORY-M4,56.1859

'but much am I beholdynge unto them. 'CMMALORY-M4,56.1860

'A, sir,'seyde Merlion,'I shall telle you.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1861

Hit ys Balyn that encheved the swerde and his brothir Balan, a good
knyght: CMMALORY-M4,56.1862

there lyvith nat a bettir of proues, nother of worthynesse.
CMMALORY-M4,56.1863

And hit shall be the grettist dole of hym that ever y knew of knyght;
CMMALORY-M4,56.1864

for he shall nat longe endure. 'CMMALORY-M4,56.1865

'Alas,'seyde kynge Arthure,'that ys grete pite`; CMMALORY-M4,56.1866

for I am muche beholdynge unto hym, CMMALORY-M4,56.1867

and I have evill deserved hit agayne for hys kyndnesse. '
CMMALORY-M4,56.1868

'Nay, nay,'sede Merlion,'he shall do much more for you,
CMMALORY-M4,56.1869

and that shall ye know in haste.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1870

But, sir, ar ye purveyde? 'seyde Merlion.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1871

'<em> For to-morn <$$em> the oste of kynge Nero, kynge Royns brothir,
woll sette on you or none with a grete oste.  CMMALORY-M4,56.1872

And therefore make you redy, CMMALORY-M4,56.1873

for I woll departe frome you. 'CMMALORY-M4,56.1874

Than kynge Arthure made hys oste redy in ten batayles; CMMALORY-M4,56.1875

and Nero was redy in the fylde afore the Castell Terrable with a grete
<P_57> oste.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1876

And he had ten batayles with many mo peple than kynge Arthure had.
CMMALORY-M4,57.1877

Than Nero had the vawarde with the moste party of the people.
CMMALORY-M4,57.1878

And Merlion com to kynge Lotte of the Ile of Orkeney, CMMALORY-M4,57.1879

and helde hym with a tale of the prophecy tylle Nero and his peple
were destroyed.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1880

And there sir Kay the Senesciall dud passyngely well, that dayes of hys
lyff the worship wente never frome hym, and sir Hervis de Revel that
dud merveylous dedys of armys that day with Arthur.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1881

And kynge Arthure slew that day twenty knyghtes CMMALORY-M4,57.1882

and maymed fourty.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1883

So at that tyme com in the Knyght with the Two Swerdis and his brothir,
CMMALORY-M4,57.1884

but they dud so mervaylously that the kynge and all the knyghtes mervayled
of them.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1885

And all they that behelde them seyde they were sente frome hevyn as
angels other devilles frome helle.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1886

And kynge Arthure seyde hymself they were the doughtyeste knyghtes that
ever he sawe, CMMALORY-M4,57.1887

for they gaff such strokes that all men had wondir of hem.
CMMALORY-M4,57.1888

So in the meanewhyle com one to kynge Lotte CMMALORY-M4,57.1889

and tolde hym whyle he tarryed there how Nero was destroyed and slayne
with all his oste.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1890

'Alas,'seyde kynge Lotte,'I am ashamed; CMMALORY-M4,57.1891

for in my defaute there ys <em> many a worshipful man slayne;
CMMALORY-M4,57.1892

for and we had teen togyders there had ben <$$em> none oste undir hevyn
were able to have macched us.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1893

But thys faytoure with hys prophecy hath mocked me. ' CMMALORY-M4,57.1894

All that dud Merlion, CMMALORY-M4,57.1895

for he knew well that $and kynge Lotte had bene with hys body at the
first batayle, kynge Arthure had be slayne and all hys peple distressed.
CMMALORY-M4,57.1896

And well Merlion knew that one of the kynges sholde be dede that day;
CMMALORY-M4,57.1897

and lothe was Merlion that ony of them bothe sholde be slayne,
CMMALORY-M4,57.1898

but of the tweyne he had levir kyng Lotte of Orkeney had be slayne
than Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1899

'What ys beste to do? 'seyde kynge Lotte.  CMMALORY-M4,57.1900

'Whether ys me bettir to trete with kynge Arthur othir to fyght?
CMMALORY-M4,57.1901

For the gretter party of oure people ar slayne and distressed.
CMMALORY-M4,57.1902

'Sir,'seyde a knyght'sette ye on Arthure, CMMALORY-M4,57.1903

for they ar wery and forfoughtyn, CMMALORY-M4,57.1904

and we be freyssh. 'CMMALORY-M4,57.1905

'As for me,'seyde kynge Lott,'I wolde that every knyght wolde do hys
parte as I wolde do myne. 'CMMALORY-M4,57.1906

Than they avaunced baners CMMALORY-M4,57.1907

and smote togydirs CMMALORY-M4,57.1908

and brused hir <P_58> sperys.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1909

And Arthurs knyghtes with the helpe of the Knyght with Two Swerdys
and hys brothir Balan put kynge Lotte and hys oste to the warre.
CMMALORY-M4,58.1910

But allwayes kynge Lotte hylde hym ever in the forefronte
CMMALORY-M4,58.1911

and dud merveylous dedis of armys; CMMALORY-M4,58.1912

for all his oste was borne up by hys hondys, CMMALORY-M4,58.1913

for he abode all knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1914

Alas, he myght nat endure, the whych was grete pite`!  CMMALORY-M4,58.1915

So worthy a knyght as he was one, that he sholde be overmacched, that
of late tyme before he had bene a knyght of kynge Arthurs, and wedded
the syster of hym.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1916

And for because that kynge Arthure lay by hys wyff and gate on
her sir Mordred, therefore kynge Lott helde ever agaynste Arthure.
CMMALORY-M4,58.1917

So there was a knyght that was called the Knyght with the Strange Beste
, CMMALORY-M4,58.1918

and at that tyme hys ryght name was called Pellynore, which was a good
man off prouesse as few in tho dayes lyvynge.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1919

And he strake a myghty stroke at kynge Lott as he fought with hys enemyes
, CMMALORY-M4,58.1920

and he fayled of hys stroke CMMALORY-M4,58.1921

and smote the horse necke, that he foundred to the erthe with kyng Lott.
CMMALORY-M4,58.1922

And therewith anone kynge Pellinor smote hym a grete stroke thorow the
helme and hede unto the browis.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1923

Than all the oste of Orkeney fledde for the deth of kynge Lotte,
CMMALORY-M4,58.1924

and there they were takyn and slayne, all the oste.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1925

But kynge Pellynore bare the wyte of the dethe of kynge Lott, wherefore
sir Gawayne revenged the deth of hys fadir the ten yere aftir he was
made knyght, CMMALORY-M4,58.1926

and slew kynge Pellynor hys owne hondis.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1927

Also there was slayne at that batayle twelve kynges on the syde of kynge
Lott with Nero, CMMALORY-M4,58.1928

and were buryed in the chirch of Seynte Stevins in Camelot.
CMMALORY-M4,58.1929

And the remanent of knyghtes and other were buryed in a grete roche.
CMMALORY-M4,58.1930

So at the enterement com kyng Lottis wyff, Morgause, with hir four sonnes,
Gawayne, Aggravayne, Gaheris, and Gareth.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1931

Also there com thydir kyng Uryens, sir Uwaynes fadir, and Morgan le Fay,
his wyff, that was kynge Arthurs syster.  CMMALORY-M4,58.1932

All thes com to the enterement CMMALORY-M4,58.1933

But of all the twelve kyngis kynge Arthure lette make the tombe of kynge
Lotte passynge rychely, CMMALORY-M4,58.1934

and made hys tombe by hymselff CMMALORY-M4,58.1935

And than Arthure lette make twelve images of laton and cooper
and overgylte with golde in the sygne of the twelve kynges;
CMMALORY-M4,58.1936

and eche one of hem helde a tapir of wexe in hir honde that brente nyght
<P_59> and day.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1937

And kynge Arthure was made in the sygne of a fygure stondynge aboven
them with a swerde drawyn in hys honde, CMMALORY-M4,59.1938

and all the twelve fygures had countenaunce lyke unto men that were
overcom.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1939

All thys made Merlion by hys subtyle craufte.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1940

And there he tolde the kynge how that when he was dede thes tapers sholde
brenne no lenger,'aftir the adventures of the Sankgreall that shall com
amonge you and be encheved. 'CMMALORY-M4,59.1941

Also he tolde kynge Arthure how Balyn, the worshipfull knyght, shall
gyff the dolerouse stroke, whereof shall falle grete vengeaunce.
CMMALORY-M4,59.1942

'A, where ys Balyne, Balan, and Pellinore? 'CMMALORY-M4,59.1943

'As for kynge Pellinore,'seyde Merlion,'he woll mete with you soone.
CMMALORY-M4,59.1944

And as for Balyne, he woll nat be longe frome you.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1945

But the other brothir woll departe: CMMALORY-M4,59.1946

ye shall se hym no more. 'CMMALORY-M4,59.1947

'Be my fayth,'seyde Arthur,'they ar two manly knyghtes,
CMMALORY-M4,59.1948

and namely that Balyne passith of proues off ony knyght that ever y
founde, CMMALORY-M4,59.1949

for much am I beholdynge unto hym.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1950

Wolde God he wolde abyde with me! 'CMMALORY-M4,59.1951

'Sir,'seyde Merlion,'loke ye kepe well the scawberd of Excaleber ,
CMMALORY-M4,59.1952

for ye shall lose no bloode whyle ye have the scawberde uppon
you , thoughe ye have as many woundis uppon you as ye may have. '
CMMALORY-M4,59.1953

<paren> So aftir for grete truste Arthure betoke the scawberde unto
Morgan le Fay, hys sister.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1954

And she loved another knyght bettir than hir husbande, kynge Uriens,
othir Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1955

And she wolde have had Arthure hir brother slayne, CMMALORY-M4,59.1956

and therefore she lete make anothir scawberd for Excaliber <em> lyke it
by enchauntement, CMMALORY-M4,59.1957

and gaf the scawberd Excaliber to her lover <$$em>.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1958

And the knyghtes name was called Accolon, that aftir had nere slayne
kynge Arthure.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1959

But aftir thys Merlion tolde unto kynge Arthure of the prophecy that
there sholde be a grete batayle besydes Salysbiry, and Mordred hys owne
sonne sholde be agaynste hym.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1960

Also he tolde hym that Bagdemagus was his cosyne germayne, and unto
kynge Uryens.  <$$paren> CMMALORY-M4,59.1961

So within a day or two kynge Arthure was somwhat syke, CMMALORY-M4,59.1962

and he lette pycch hys pavilion in a medow, CMMALORY-M4,59.1963

and there he leyde hym downe on a paylet to slepe; CMMALORY-M4,59.1964

but he myght have no reste.  CMMALORY-M4,59.1965

Ryght so he herde a grete noyse of an horse, CMMALORY-M4,59.1966

and therewith the kynge loked oute at the porche dore of the pavilion
CMMALORY-M4,59.1967

and saw a knyght commynge evyn by hym makynge grete dole.
CMMALORY-M4,59.1968

<P_60>

'Abyde, fayre sir,'seyde Arthure,'CMMALORY-M4,60.1970

and telle me wherefore thou makyst this sorow. 'CMMALORY-M4,60.1971

'Ye may litill amende me,'seyde the knyght, CMMALORY-M4,60.1972

and so passed forth to the Castell of Meliot.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1973

And anone aftir that com Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1974

And whan he saw kyng Arthur he alyght of hys horse CMMALORY-M4,60.1975

and com to the kynge one foote CMMALORY-M4,60.1976

and salewed hym.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1977

Be my hede,'seyde Arthure,'ye be wellcom.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1978

Sir, ryght now com rydynge thys way a knyght makynge grete morne,
CMMALORY-M4,60.1979

and for what cause I can nat telle.  Wherefore I wolde desire of you,
of your curtesy and of your jantilnesse, to fecche agayne that knyght
othir by force othir by his good wylle.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1980

'I shall do more for youre lordeship than that,'seyde Balyne,
'CMMALORY-M4,60.1981

othir ellis I woll greve hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,60.1982

So Balyn rode more than a pace CMMALORY-M4,60.1983

and founde the knyght with a damesell undir a foreyste CMMALORY-M4,60.1984

and seyde,'Sir knyght, ye muste com with me unto kynge Arthure for to
telle hym of youre sorow. 'CMMALORY-M4,60.1985

'That woll I nat,'seyde the knyght,'CMMALORY-M4,60.1986

for hit woll harme me gretely and do you none avayle. '
CMMALORY-M4,60.1987

'Sir,'seyde Balyne,'I pray you make you redy, CMMALORY-M4,60.1988

for ye muste go with me CMMALORY-M4,60.1989

othir ellis I muste fyght with you and brynge you by $force
CMMALORY-M4,60.1990

And that were me lothe to do. 'CMMALORY-M4,60.1991

'Woll ye be my warraunte,'seyde the knyght,'and I go with you?
'CMMALORY-M4,60.1992

'Yee,'seyde Balyne,'CMMALORY-M4,60.1993

othir ellis, by the fayth of my body I woll dye therefore. '
CMMALORY-M4,60.1994

And so he made hym redy to go with Balyne CMMALORY-M4,60.1995

and leffte the damesell stylle.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1996

And as were evyn before Arhturs pavilion, there com one invisible
CMMALORY-M4,60.1997

and smote the knyght that wente with Balyn thorowoute the body with
a spere.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1998

'Alas! 'seyde the knyght,'I am slayne undir youre conduyte with a knyght
called $Garlon.  CMMALORY-M4,60.1999

Therefore take my horse that is bettir than youres, CMMALORY-M4,60.2000

and ryde to the damesell CMMALORY-M4,60.2001

and folow the queste that I was in as she woll lede you,
CMMALORY-M4,60.2002

and revenge my deth whan ye may.  CMMALORY-M4,60.2003

'That shall I do,'seyde Balyn, CMMALORY-M4,60.2004

'and that I make a vow to God and knyghthode. 'CMMALORY-M4,60.2005

And so he departed frome kynge Arthure with grete sorow.
CMMALORY-M4,60.2006

So kynge Arthure lette bury this knyght rychely, CMMALORY-M4,60.2007

and made mencion <P_61> $on his tombe how here was slayne Berbeus and
by whom the trechory was done of the knyght $Garlon.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2008

But ever the damesell bare the truncheon of the spere with hir that sir
Harleus le Berbeus was slayne withall.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2009

So Balyne and the damesell rode into the foreyste CMMALORY-M4,61.2010

and there mette with a knyght that had bene an hontynge.
CMMALORY-M4,61.2011

And that knyght asked Balyn for what cause he made so grete sorow.
CMMALORY-M4,61.2012

'Me lyste nat to telle,'seyde Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2013

'Now,'seyde the knyght,'and I were armed as ye be, I wolde fyght with
you but iff ye tolde me. 'CMMALORY-M4,61.2014

'That sholde litell nede,'seyde Balyne,'CMMALORY-M4,61.2015

I am nat aferde to telle you,'CMMALORY-M4,61.2016

and so tolde hym all the case how hit was.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2017

'A,'seyde the knyght,'ys thys all?  CMMALORY-M4,61.2018

Here I ensure you by the feyth of my body never to departe frome you
whyle my lyff lastith. 'CMMALORY-M4,61.2019

And so they wente to their ostre` CMMALORY-M4,61.2020

and armed hem CMMALORY-M4,61.2021

and so rode forthe with Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2022

And as they com by an ermytage evyn by a $chyrcheyerde, there com $Garlon
invisible CMMALORY-M4,61.2023

and smote this knyght, Peryne de Mounte Belyarde, thorowoute the body
with a glayve.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2024

'Alas,'seyde the knyght,'I am slayne by thys traytoure knyght that rydith
invisible. 'CMMALORY-M4,61.2025

'Alas,'seyde Balyne,'thys ys nat the firste despite that he hath done
me. 'CMMALORY-M4,61.2026

And there the ermyte and Balyne buryed the knyght undir a ryche stone
and a tombe royall.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2027

And on the morne they founde letters of golde wretyn how that sir Gawayne
shall revenge his fadirs deth <em> kynge Lot <$$em> on kynge Pellynore.
CMMALORY-M4,61.2028

And anone aftir this Balyne and the damesell rode forth tylle they com
to a castell.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2029

And anone Balyne alyghte CMMALORY-M4,61.2030

and wente in.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2031

And as sone as <em> Balyne came <$$em> with <em> in the castels yate
<$$em> the portecolys were lette downe at his backe, CMMALORY-M4,61.2032

and there felle many men aboute the damesell CMMALORY-M4,61.2033

and wolde have slayne hir.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2034

Whan Balyne saw that, he was sore greved CMMALORY-M4,61.2035

for he myght nat helpe her.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2036

But than he wente up into a towre CMMALORY-M4,61.2037

and lepte over the wallis into the dyche CMMALORY-M4,61.2038

and hurte nat hymselff.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2039

And anone he pulled oute his swerde CMMALORY-M4,61.2040

and wolde have foughtyn with them.  CMMALORY-M4,61.2041

And they all seyde nay, they wolde nat fyght with hym, CMMALORY-M4,61.2042

for they dud nothynge but the olde custom of thys castell,
CMMALORY-M4,61.2043

<P_62>

and tolde hym that hir lady was syke and had leyne many yeres, and she
myght nat be hole but yf she had bloode in a sylver dysshe full of a
clene mayde and a kynges doughter.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2045

'And therefore the custom of thys castell ys that there shall no damesell
passe thys way but she shall blede of hir bloode a sylver dysshefull.
'CMMALORY-M4,62.2046

'Well,'seyde Balyne,'she shall blede as much as she may blede,
CMMALORY-M4,62.2047

but I woll nat lose the lyff of hir whyle my lyff lastith. '
CMMALORY-M4,62.2048

And so Balyn made hir to bleede by hir good wylle, CMMALORY-M4,62.2049

but hir bloode holpe nat the lady.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2050

And so she and he rested there all that nyght CMMALORY-M4,62.2051

and had good chere, CMMALORY-M4,62.2052

and in the mornynge they passed on their wayes.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2053

And as hit tellith aftir in the SANKGREAL that sir Percivall his syster
holpe that lady with hir blood, whereof she was dede.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2054

Than they rode three or four dayes CMMALORY-M4,62.2055

and nevir mette with adventure.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2056

And so by fortune they were lodged with a jantilman <em> that was a
ryche man and well at ease.  <$$em> CMMALORY-M4,62.2057

And as they sate at souper Balyn herde one complayne grevously by hym
in a chambir.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2058

'What ys thys noyse? 'seyde Balyn.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2059

'For sothe,'seyde his oste,'I woll telle you.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2060

I was but late at a justynge CMMALORY-M4,62.2061

and there I justed with a knyght that ys brothir unto kynge Pellam,
CMMALORY-M4,62.2062

and twyse I smote hym downe.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2063

And than he promysed to quyte me on my beste frende.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2064

And so he wounded thus my son that can nat be hole tylle I have of that
knyghtes bloode.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2065

And he rydith all invisyble, CMMALORY-M4,62.2066

but I know nat hys name. 'CMMALORY-M4,62.2067

'A,'seyde Balyne,'I know that knyghtes name, which ys $Garlon,
CMMALORY-M4,62.2068

and he hath slayne two knyghtes of myne in the same maner.
CMMALORY-M4,62.2069

Therefore I had levir mete with that knyght than all the golde in thys
realme, for the despyte he hath done me. 'CMMALORY-M4,62.2070

'Well,'seyde hys oste,'I shall telle you how.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2071

Kynge Pellam off Lystenoyse hath made do cry in all the contrey a grete
feste that shall be within thes twenty dayes, and no knyght may com there
but he brynge hys wyff with hym othir hys paramoure.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2072

And that your enemy and myne ye shall se that day. 'CMMALORY-M4,62.2073

'Than I promyse you,'seyde Balyn,'parte of his bloode to hele youre
sonne withall. 'CMMALORY-M4,62.2074

'Than we woll be forewarde to-morne,'seyde he.  CMMALORY-M4,62.2075

So on the morne they rode all three towarde kynge Pellam,
CMMALORY-M4,62.2076

and they had fyftene dayes journey or they com thydir.
CMMALORY-M4,62.2077

And that same <P_63> day began the grete feste.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2078

And so they alyght CMMALORY-M4,63.2079

and stabled their horsis CMMALORY-M4,63.2080

and wente into the castell, CMMALORY-M4,63.2081

but Balynes oste myght $not be lette in because he had no lady.
CMMALORY-M4,63.2082

But Balyne was well receyved and brought unto a chambir
CMMALORY-M4,63.2083

and unarmed hym.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2084

And there was brought hym robis to his plesure, CMMALORY-M4,63.2085

and wolde have had Balyn leve his swerde behynde hym.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2086

'Nay,'seyde Balyne,'that woll I nat, CMMALORY-M4,63.2087

for hit ys the custom of my contrey a knyght allweyes to kepe hys wepyn
with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2088

Other ells,'seyde he,'I woll departe as I $cam. ' CMMALORY-M4,63.2089

Than they gaff hym leve with his swerde, CMMALORY-M4,63.2090

and so he wente into the castell CMMALORY-M4,63.2091

and was amonge knyghtes of worship and hys lady afore hym.
CMMALORY-M4,63.2092

So aftir this Balyne asked a knyght CMMALORY-M4,63.2093

and seyde,'Ys there nat a knyght in thys courte which his name ys
$Garlon? 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2094

'Yes, sir, yondir he goth, the knyght with the blacke face,
CMMALORY-M4,63.2095

for he ys the mervaylyste knyght that ys now lyvynge.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2096

And he destroyeth many good knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,63.2097

for he goth invisible. 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2098

'Well,'seyde Balyn,'ys that he? 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2099

Than Balyn avised hym longe, CMMALORY-M4,63.2100

and thought:'If I sle hym here, I shall nat escape.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2101

And if I leve hym now, peraventure I shall never mete with hym agayne
at such a stevyn, CMMALORY-M4,63.2102

and muche harme he woll do and he lyve. 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2103

And therewith thys $Garlon aspyed that Balyn vysaged hym,
CMMALORY-M4,63.2104

so he com CMMALORY-M4,63.2105

and slapped hym on the face with the backe of hys honde
CMMALORY-M4,63.2106

and seyde,'Knyght, why beholdist thou me so?  CMMALORY-M4,63.2107

For shame, ete thy mete CMMALORY-M4,63.2108

and do that thou com fore. 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2109

'Thou seyst soth,'seyde Balyne, CMMALORY-M4,63.2110

'thys ys nat the firste spite that thou haste done me.
CMMALORY-M4,63.2111

And therefore I woll do that I com fore. 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2112

And rose hym up fersely CMMALORY-M4,63.2113

and clave his hede to the sholdirs.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2114

'Now geff me $the troncheon,'seyde Balyn <em> to his lady <$$em>,
'that he slew youre knyght with. 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2115

And anone she gaff hit hym, CMMALORY-M4,63.2116

for allwey she bare the truncheoune with hir.  CMMALORY-M4,63.2117

And therewith $Balyn smote hym thorow the body CMMALORY-M4,63.2118

and seyde opynly,'With that troncheon thou slewyste a good knyght,
CMMALORY-M4,63.2119

and now hit stykith in thy body. 'CMMALORY-M4,63.2120

Than Balyn called unto hys oste CMMALORY-M4,63.2121

and seyde,'Now may we fecche blood inoughe to hele youre son withall.
'CMMALORY-M4,63.2122

<P_64>

So anone all the knyghtes rose frome the table for to sette on Balyne.
CMMALORY-M4,64.2124

And kynge Pellam hymself arose up fersely CMMALORY-M4,64.2125

and seyde'Knyght, why hast thou slayne my brothir?  CMMALORY-M4,64.2126

Thou shalt dey there fore or thou departe. 'CMMALORY-M4,64.2127

'Well,'seyde Balyn,'do hit youreselff. 'CMMALORY-M4,64.2128

'Yes,'seyde kyng Pellam,'there shall no man have ado with the but I
myselff, for the love of my brothir. 'CMMALORY-M4,64.2129

Than kynge Pellam <em> caught in his hand <$$em> a grymme wepyn
CMMALORY-M4,64.2130

and smote egirly at Balyn, CMMALORY-M4,64.2131

but he put hys swerde betwyxte hys hede and the stroke,
CMMALORY-M4,64.2132

and therewith hys swerde braste in sundir.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2133

And when Balyne was wepynles he ran into a chambir for to seke a wepyn
$and fro chambir to chambir, CMMALORY-M4,64.2134

and no wepyn coude he fynde.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2135

And allwayes kyng Pellam folowed afftir hym.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2136

And at the last he enterde into a chambir $whych was mervaylously dyght
and ryche, and abedde arayed with cloth of golde, the rychiste that
myght be, and one lyyng therein, CMMALORY-M4,64.2137

and thereby stoode a table of clene golde <em> with four pyllars of
sylver that bare up the table <$$em>.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2138

And uppon the table stoode a mervaylous spere strangely wrought.
CMMALORY-M4,64.2139

So when Balyn saw the spere he gate hit in hys honde CMMALORY-M4,64.2140

and turned to kynge Pellam CMMALORY-M4,64.2141

and felde hym CMMALORY-M4,64.2142

and smote hym passyngly sore with that spere, that kynge Pellam $felle
downe in a sowghe.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2143

And there-with the castell brake roffe and wallis CMMALORY-M4,64.2144

and felle downe to the erthe.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2145

And Balyn felle downe CMMALORY-M4,64.2146

and myght nat styrre hande nor foote, CMMALORY-M4,64.2147

and for the moste party of that castell was dede thorow the dolorouse
stroke.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2148

Ryght so lay kynge Pellam and Balyne three dayes.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2149

Than Merlion com thydir, CMMALORY-M4,64.2150

and toke up Balyn CMMALORY-M4,64.2151

and gate hym a good horse, for hys was dede, CMMALORY-M4,64.2152

and bade hym voyde oute of that contrey.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2153

'Sir, I wolde have my damesell,'seyde Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2154

'Loo,'seyde Merlion,'where she lyeth dede. 'CMMALORY-M4,64.2155

And kynge Pellam lay so many yerys sore wounded, CMMALORY-M4,64.2156

and myght never be hole tylle that Galaad the Hawte Prynce heled hym in
the queste of the Sankgreall.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2157

For in that place was parte of the bloode of oure Lorde Jesu Cryste,
which Joseph off Aramathy brought into thys londe.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2158

And there hymselff $lay in that ryche bedde.  CMMALORY-M4,64.2159

And that was the spere whych Longeus smote oure Lorde with to the herte.
CMMALORY-M4,64.2160

<P_65>

And kynge Pellam was nyghe of Joseph his kynne, CMMALORY-M4,65.2162

and that was the moste worshipfullist man on lyve in tho dayes,
CMMALORY-M4,65.2163

and grete pite` hit was of hys hurte, CMMALORY-M4,65.2164

for thorow that stroke hit turned to grete dole, tray and tene.
CMMALORY-M4,65.2165

Than departed Balyne frome Merlyon, CMMALORY-M4,65.2166

'for,'he seyde,'nevir in thys worlde we parte nother meete no
more. 'CMMALORY-M4,65.2167

So he rode forthe thorow the fayre contreyes and citeys
CMMALORY-M4,65.2168

and founde the peple dede slayne on every syde, CMMALORY-M4,65.2169

and all that evir were on lyve cryed CMMALORY-M4,65.2170

and seyde,'A, Balyne!  Thou hast done and caused grete $dommage in
thys contreyes!  CMMALORY-M4,65.2171

For the dolerous stroke thou gaff unto kynge Pellam thes three contreyes
ar destroyed.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2172

And doute nat but the vengeaunce woll falle on the at the laste!
'CMMALORY-M4,65.2173

But when Balyn was past tho contreyes he was passynge fayne,
CMMALORY-M4,65.2174

and so he rode eyght dayes or he mette with many adventure.
CMMALORY-M4,65.2175

And at the last he com into a fayre foreyst in a valey,
CMMALORY-M4,65.2176

and was ware of a towure.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2177

And there besyde he mette with a grete horse tyed to a tree,
CMMALORY-M4,65.2178

and besyde there sate a fayre knyght on the grounde CMMALORY-M4,65.2179

and made grete mournynge, CMMALORY-M4,65.2180

and he was a lyckly man and a well made.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2181

Balyne seyde,'God you save!  CMMALORY-M4,65.2182

Why be ye so hevy?  CMMALORY-M4,65.2183

Tell me, and I woll amende and I may to my power. 'CMMALORY-M4,65.2184

'Sir knyght,'he seyde,'thou doste me grete gryeff, CMMALORY-M4,65.2185

for I was in $mery thoughtes CMMALORY-M4,65.2186

and thou puttist me to more payne. 'CMMALORY-M4,65.2187

Than Balyn went a litill frome hym CMMALORY-M4,65.2188

and loked on hys horse, CMMALORY-M4,65.2189

than herde Balyne hym sey thus: CMMALORY-M4,65.2190

'A, fayre lady!  Why have ye brokyn my promyse?  CMMALORY-M4,65.2191

For ye promysed me to mete me here by noone.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2192

And I may curse you that ever ye gaff me that swerde, CMMALORY-M4,65.2193

for with thys swerde I woll sle myselff,'CMMALORY-M4,65.2194

and pulde hit out.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2195

And therewith com Balyne CMMALORY-M4,65.2196

and sterte unto hym CMMALORY-M4,65.2197

and toke hym by the honde.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2198

'Lette go my hande,'seyde the knyght,'or ellis I shall sle the!
'CMMALORY-M4,65.2199

'That shall nat nede,'seyde Balyn, CMMALORY-M4,65.2200

'for I shall promyse you my helpe to gete you youre lady
CMMALORY-M4,65.2201

and ye woll telle me where she ys. 'CMMALORY-M4,65.2202

'What ys your name? 'seyde the knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,65.2203

'Sir, my name ys Balyne le Saveage. 'CMMALORY-M4,65.2204

'A, sir, I know you well inowghe: CMMALORY-M4,65.2205

ye ar the Knyght with the Two Swerdis, and the man of moste proues of
youre hondis lyvynge. 'CMMALORY-M4,65.2206

<P_66>

'What ys your name? 'seyde Balyne.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2208

'My name ys Garnysh of the Mownte, a poore mannes sonne,
CMMALORY-M4,66.2209

and be my proues and hardynes a deuke made me knyght CMMALORY-M4,66.2210

and gave me londis.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2211

Hys name ys duke Harmel, CMMALORY-M4,66.2212

and hys doughter ys <em> she that I love, and she me, as I demed.
'CMMALORY-M4,66.2213

'Hou fer is she hens? 'sayd Balyn.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2214

'But six myle,'said the knyghte.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2215

'Now ryde we hens,'sayde these two knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2216

So they rode more than a paas tyll that they cam to a fayr castel wel
wallyd and dyched.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2217

'I wylle into the castel,'sayd Balen,'and loke yf she be ther.
'CMMALORY-M4,66.2218

Soo he wente in CMMALORY-M4,66.2219

and serched fro chamber to chambir CMMALORY-M4,66.2220

and fond her bedde, CMMALORY-M4,66.2221

but she was not there.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2222

Thenne Balen loked into a fayr litil gardyn, CMMALORY-M4,66.2223

and under a laurel tre he sawe her lye upon a quylt of grene samyte,
and a knyght in her armes fast halsynge eyther other, and under their
hedes grasse and herbes.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2224

Whan Balen sawe her lye so with the fowlest knyghte that ever he sawe,
and she a fair lady, thenne Balyn wente thurgh alle the chambers ageyne
CMMALORY-M4,66.2225

and told the knyghte how he fond her as she had slepte fast,
CMMALORY-M4,66.2226

and so brought hym in the place there she lay fast slepynge.
CMMALORY-M4,66.2227

And when Garnyssh beheld hir so lyeng, for pure sorou his mouth and nose
brast oute on bledynge, CMMALORY-M4,66.2228

and with his swerd he smote of bothe their hedes.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2229

And thenne he maade sorowe oute of mesure CMMALORY-M4,66.2230

and sayd,'O, Balyn!  Moche sorow hast thow brought unto me,
CMMALORY-M4,66.2231

for haddest thow not shewed me that syght I shold have passed my sorow.
'CMMALORY-M4,66.2232

'Forsoth,'said Balyn,'I did it to this entent that it sholde better thy
courage and that ye myght see and knowe her falshede, and to cause yow
to leve love of suche a lady; CMMALORY-M4,66.2233

God knoweth I dyd none other but as I wold ye dyd to me. '
CMMALORY-M4,66.2234

'Allas,'said Garnysshe,'now is my sorou doubel that I may not endure,
CMMALORY-M4,66.2235

now have I slayne that I moost loved in al my lyf! 'CMMALORY-M4,66.2236

And therwith sodenly he roofe hymself on his own swerd unto the hyltys.
CMMALORY-M4,66.2237

When Balen sawe that, he dressid hym thensward, lest folke wold say he
had slayne them.  CMMALORY-M4,66.2238

And so he rode forth, CMMALORY-M4,66.2239

and within thre dayes he cam by a crosse; CMMALORY-M4,66.2240

and theron were letters of gold wryten that said: <P_67>'it is not for
no knyght alone to ryde toward this castel. 'CMMALORY-M4,67.2241

Thenne sawe he an old hore gentylman comyng toward hym that sayd, 'Balyn
le Saveage, thow passyst thy bandes to come this waye, CMMALORY-M4,67.2242

therfor torne ageyne and it will availle the,'CMMALORY-M4,67.2243

and he vanysshed awey anone.  CMMALORY-M4,67.2244

And soo he herd an horne blowe as it had ben the dethe of a best.
CMMALORY-M4,67.2245

'That blast,'said Balyn,'is blowen for me, CMMALORY-M4,67.2246

for I am the pryse, CMMALORY-M4,67.2247

and yet am I not dede. 'CMMALORY-M4,67.2248

Anone withal he sawe an honderd ladyes and many knyghtes that welcommed
hym with fayr semblaunt CMMALORY-M4,67.2249

and made hym passyng good chere unto his syght, CMMALORY-M4,67.2250

and ledde hym into the castel, CMMALORY-M4,67.2251

and ther was daunsynge and mynstralsye and alle maner of joye.
CMMALORY-M4,67.2252

Thenne the chyef lady of the castel said,'Knyghte with the Two Suerdys ,
ye must have adoo and juste with a knyght hereby that kepeth an iland ,
CMMALORY-M4,67.2253

for ther may no man passe this way but he must juste or he passe.
'CMMALORY-M4,67.2254

'That is an unhappy customme,'said Balyn,'that a knyght may not passe
this wey but yf he juste. 'CMMALORY-M4,67.2255

'Ye shalle not have adoo but with one knyghte,'sayd the lady.
CMMALORY-M4,67.2256

'Wel,'sayd Balyn,'syn I shalle, therto I am redy; CMMALORY-M4,67.2257

but traveillynge men are ofte wery and their horses to,
CMMALORY-M4,67.2258

but though my hors be wery my hert is not wery.  CMMALORY-M4,67.2259

I wold be fayne ther my deth shold be. 'CMMALORY-M4,67.2260

'Syr,'said a knyght to Balyn,'$me $thynketh {TEXT:methynketh} your sheld
is not good; CMMALORY-M4,67.2261

I wille lene yow a byggar, CMMALORY-M4,67.2262

therof I pray yow. 'CMMALORY-M4,67.2263

And so he tooke the sheld that was unknowen CMMALORY-M4,67.2264

and lefte his owne, CMMALORY-M4,67.2265

and so rode unto the iland CMMALORY-M4,67.2266

and put hym and his hors in a grete boote.  CMMALORY-M4,67.2267

And when he came on the other syde he met with a damoysel,
CMMALORY-M4,67.2268

and she said,'O, knyght Balyn, why have ye lefte your owne sheld?
CMMALORY-M4,67.2269

Allas!  ye have put yourself in grete daunger, CMMALORY-M4,67.2270

for by your sheld ye shold have ben knowen.  CMMALORY-M4,67.2271

It is grete pyte` of yow as ever was of knyght, CMMALORY-M4,67.2272

for of thy prowesse and hardynes thou hast no felawe lyvynge. '
CMMALORY-M4,67.2273

'Me repenteth,'said Balyn,'that ever I cam within this countrey;
CMMALORY-M4,67.2274

but I maye not torne now ageyne for shame, CMMALORY-M4,67.2275

and what aventure shalle falle to me, be it lyf or dethe, I wille take
the adventure that shalle come to me. 'CMMALORY-M4,67.2276

And thenne he loked on his armour CMMALORY-M4,67.2277

and understood he was wel armed, CMMALORY-M4,67.2278

and therwith blessid hym CMMALORY-M4,67.2279

and mounted upon his hors.  CMMALORY-M4,67.2280

<P_68>

Thenne afore hym he sawe come rydynge oute of a castel a knyght,
and his hors trapped all reed, and hymself in the same colour.
CMMALORY-M4,68.2282

Whan this knyghte in the reed beheld Balyn hym thought it shold be his
broder Balen by cause of his two swerdys, CMMALORY-M4,68.2283

but by cause he knewe not his sheld he demed it was not he.
CMMALORY-M4,68.2284

And so they aventryd theyr speres CMMALORY-M4,68.2285

and came merveillously fast togyders, CMMALORY-M4,68.2286

and they smote other in the sheldes, CMMALORY-M4,68.2287

but theire speres and theire cours were soo bygge that it bare doune
hors and man, that they lay bothe in a swoun.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2288

But Balyn was brysed sore with the falle of his hors, CMMALORY-M4,68.2289

for he was wery of travaille.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2290

And Balan was the fyrst that rose on foote and drewe his swerd and wente
toward Balyn, CMMALORY-M4,68.2291

and he aroos CMMALORY-M4,68.2292

and wente ageynst hym; CMMALORY-M4,68.2293

but Balan smote Balyn fyrste, CMMALORY-M4,68.2294

and he put up his shelde CMMALORY-M4,68.2295

and smote hym thorow the shelde CMMALORY-M4,68.2296

and tamyd his helme.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2297

thenne Balyn smote hym ageyne with that unhappy swerd CMMALORY-M4,68.2298

and wel nyghe had fellyd his broder Balan, CMMALORY-M4,68.2299

and so they fought ther togyders tyl theyr brethes faylled.
CMMALORY-M4,68.2300

Thenne Balyn loked up to the castel CMMALORY-M4,68.2301

and sawe the towres stand ful of ladyes.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2302

Soo they went unto bataille ageyne CMMALORY-M4,68.2303

and wounded everyche other dolefully, CMMALORY-M4,68.2304

and thenne they brethed oftymes, CMMALORY-M4,68.2305

and so wente unto bataille that alle the place $there $as {TEXT:thereas}
they fought was blood reed.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2306

And att that tyme ther was none of them bothe but they hadde eyther
smyten other seven grete woundes so that the lest of them myght have
ben the dethe of the myghtyest gyaunt in this world.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2307

Thenne they wente to batail ageyn so merveillously that doubte it was
to here of that bataille for the grete blood shedynge; CMMALORY-M4,68.2308

and their hawberkes unnailled, that naked they were on every syde.
CMMALORY-M4,68.2309

$At $te {TEXT:atte} last Balan, the yonger broder, withdrewe hym a lytel
CMMALORY-M4,68.2310

and leid hym doune.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2311

Thenne said Balyn le Saveage,'What knyghte arte thow?  CMMALORY-M4,68.2312

For or now I found never no knyght that matched me. ' CMMALORY-M4,68.2313

'My name is,'said he,'Balan, broder unto the good knyght Balyn.
'CMMALORY-M4,68.2314

'Allais'sayd Balyn,'that ever I shold see this day,' CMMALORY-M4,68.2315

and therwith he felle backward in a swoune.  CMMALORY-M4,68.2316

Thenne Balan yede on al four feet and handes, CMMALORY-M4,68.2317

and put of the helme of his broder, CMMALORY-M4,68.2318

and myght not knowe hym by the vysage, it was so ful hewen and bledde;
CMMALORY-M4,68.2319

but when he awoke he sayd, <P_69>'O, Balan, my broder!  Thow hast
slayne me and I the, wherfore alle the wyde world shalle speke of us
bothe. 'CMMALORY-M4,69.2320

'Allas! 'sayd Balan,'that ever I sawe this day that thorow myshap I
myght not knowe yow!  CMMALORY-M4,69.2321

For I aspyed wel your two swerdys, CMMALORY-M4,69.2322

but bycause ye had another shild I demed ye had ben another knyght.
'CMMALORY-M4,69.2323

'Allas! 'saide Balyn,'all that maade an unhappy knyght in the castel,
CMMALORY-M4,69.2324

for he caused me to leve myn owne shelde to our bothes destruction.
CMMALORY-M4,69.2325

And yf I myght lyve I wold destroye that castel for ylle customes.
'CMMALORY-M4,69.2326

'That were wel done,'said Balan, CMMALORY-M4,69.2327

'for I had never grace to departe fro hem syn that I cam hyther,
CMMALORY-M4,69.2328

for here it happed me to slee a knyght that kept this iland,

and syn myght I never departe, and no more shold ye, broder, and ye
myght have slayne me as ye have and escaped yourself with the lyf.
'CMMALORY-M4,69.2330

Ryght so cam the lady of the toure with four knyghtes and six ladyes
and six yomen unto them, CMMALORY-M4,69.2331

and there she herd how they made her mone eyther to other and sayd,
'We came bothe oute of one $wombe, that is to say one moders bely,
CMMALORY-M4,69.2332

and so shalle we lye bothe in one pytte. 'CMMALORY-M4,69.2333

So Balan prayd the lady of her gentylnesse for his true servyse that she
wold burye them bothe in that same place there the bataille was done,
CMMALORY-M4,69.2334

and she graunted hem with wepynge it shold be done rychely in the
best maner.  CMMALORY-M4,69.2335

'Now wille ye sende for a preest that we may receyve our sacrament and
receyve the blessid body of oure Lord Jesu Cryst? 'CMMALORY-M4,69.2336

'Ye,'said the lady,'it shalle be done;'CMMALORY-M4,69.2337

and so she sente for a preest CMMALORY-M4,69.2338

and gaf hem her ryghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,69.2339

'Now,'sayd Balen,'when we are buryed in one tombe and the mensyon made
over us how two bretheren slewe eche other, there wille never good
knyght nor good man see our tombe but they wille pray for our soules,
'CMMALORY-M4,69.2340

and so alle the ladyes and gentylwymen wepte for pyte`.
CMMALORY-M4,69.2341

Thenne anone Balan dyed, CMMALORY-M4,69.2342

but Balyn dyed not tyl the mydnyghte after.  CMMALORY-M4,69.2343

And so were they buryed bothe, CMMALORY-M4,69.2344

and the lady lete make a mensyon of Balan how he was ther slayne by his
broders handes, CMMALORY-M4,69.2345

but she knewe not Balyns name.  CMMALORY-M4,69.2346

In the morne cam Merlyn CMMALORY-M4,69.2347

and lete wryte Balyns name on the tombe with letters of gold that' here
lyeth Balyn le Saveage that <P_70> was the knyght with the two swerdes
and he that smote the dolorous stroke. 'CMMALORY-M4,70.2348

Also Merlyn lete make there a bedde, that ther shold never man lye therin
but he wente oute of his wytte.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2349

Yet Launcelot de Lake fordyd that bed thorow his noblesse.
CMMALORY-M4,70.2350

And anone after Balyn was dede Merlyn toke his swerd CMMALORY-M4,70.2351

and toke of the pomel CMMALORY-M4,70.2352

and set on another pomel.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2353

So Merlyn <$$em> bade a knyght that stood before hym to handyll the
swerde, CMMALORY-M4,70.2354

and he assayde hit CMMALORY-M4,70.2355

and myght nat handyll hit.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2356

Than Merlion lowghe.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2357

'Why lawghe ye? 'seyde the knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2358

'Thys ys the cause,'seyde Merlion: CMMALORY-M4,70.2359

'there shall never man handyll thys swerde but the beste knyght of the
worlde, CMMALORY-M4,70.2360

and that shall be sir Launcelot other ellis Galahad, hys sonne.
CMMALORY-M4,70.2361

And Launcelot with hys swerde shall sle the man in the worlde that he
lovith beste: CMMALORY-M4,70.2362

that shall be sir Gawayne. 'CMMALORY-M4,70.2363

And all thys he lette wryte in the pomell of the swerde.
CMMALORY-M4,70.2364

Than Merlion lette make a brygge of iron and of steele into that ilonde
, CMMALORY-M4,70.2365

and hit was but halff a foote brode, CMMALORY-M4,70.2366

'and there shall never man passe that brygge nother have hardynesse to go
over hit but yf he were a passynge good man withoute trechery or vylany.
'CMMALORY-M4,70.2367

Also the scawberd off Balyns swerde Merlion lefte hit on thys syde the
ilonde, that Galaad sholde fynde hit.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2368

Also Merlion lette make by hys suttelyte` that Balynes swerde was put
into a marbil stone stondynge upryght as grete as a mylstone, and hoved
allwayes above the watir, and dud many yeres.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2369

And so by adventure hit swamme downe by the streme unto the cite` of
Camelot, that ys in Englysh called Wynchester, CMMALORY-M4,70.2370

and that same day Galahad the Haute Prynce com with kynge Arthure,
CMMALORY-M4,70.2371

and so Galaad brought with hym the scawberde CMMALORY-M4,70.2372

and encheved the swerde that was in the marble stone hovynge uppon
the watir.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2373

And on Whytsonday he enchevyd the swerde, as hit ys rehersed in THE
BOOKE OF THE SANKGREALL.  CMMALORY-M4,70.2374

Sone aftir thys was done Merlion com to kynge Arthur CMMALORY-M4,70.2375

and tolde hym of the dolerous stroke that Balyn gaff kynge Pellam,
and how Balyn and Balan fought togydirs the $merveylyste batayle
that evir was herde off, and how they were buryed bothe in one tombe.
CMMALORY-M4,70.2376

'Alas! 'seyde kynge Arthure,'thys ys the grettist pite` that ever I
herde telle off of two knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,70.2377

for in thys worlde I knewe never such two knyghtes. ' CMMALORY-M4,70.2378

<P_71>

THUS ENDITH THE TALE OF BALYN AND BALAN, TWO BRETHIRNE THAT WERE BORNE
IN NORTHUMBIRLONDE, THAT WERE TWO PASSYNGE GOOD KNYGHTES AS EVER WERE
IN THO DAYES.  EXPLICIT.  CMMALORY-M4,71.2380

<P_180>

<heading>

THE NOBLE TALE OF SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE CMMALORY-M4,180.2383

<$$heading>

SONE aftir that kynge Arthure was com from Rome into Ingelonde
than all the knyghtys of the Rounde Table resorted unto the kynge
CMMALORY-M4,180.2385

and made many joustys and turnementes.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2386

And some there were that were but knyghtes encresed in armys and worshyp
that passed all other of her felowys in prouesse and noble dedys,
CMMALORY-M4,180.2387

and that was well proved on many.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2388

But in especiall hit was prevyd on sir Launcelot de Lake,
CMMALORY-M4,180.2389

for in all turnementes, justys, and dedys of armys, both for lyff and
deth, he passed all other knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,180.2390

and at no tyme was he ovircom but yf hit were by treson other
inchauntement.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2391

So this sir Launcelot encresed so mervaylously in worship and honoure;
CMMALORY-M4,180.2392

therefore he is the fyrste knyght that the $Freynsh booke makyth $mencion
of aftir kynge Arthure com frome Rome.  Wherefore quene Gwenyvere had
hym in grete favoure aboven all other knyghtis, CMMALORY-M4,180.2393

and so he loved the quene agayne aboven all other ladyes dayes of his
lyff, CMMALORY-M4,180.2394

and for hir he dud many dedys of armys CMMALORY-M4,180.2395

and saved her from the fyre thorow his noble chevalry.
CMMALORY-M4,180.2396

Thus sir Launcelot rested hym longe with play and game;
CMMALORY-M4,180.2397

and than he thought hymself to preve in straunge adventures,
CMMALORY-M4,180.2398

and bade his nevew, sir Lyonell, for to make hym redy,'for we muste go
seke adventures'.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2399

So they mounted on their horses, armed at all ryghtes CMMALORY-M4,180.2400

and rode into a depe foreste and so into a playne.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2401

So the wedir was hote aboute noone, CMMALORY-M4,180.2402

and sir Launcelot had grete luste to slepe.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2403

Than sir Lyonell aspyed a grete appyll-tre that stoode by an hedge,
CMMALORY-M4,180.2404

and seyde,'Sir, yondir is a fayre shadow, CMMALORY-M4,180.2405

there may we reste us and oure horsys. 'CMMALORY-M4,180.2406

'Hit is trouthe,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,180.2407

'for this seven yere I was not so slepy as I am nowe. '
CMMALORY-M4,180.2408

So there they alyted CMMALORY-M4,180.2409

and tyed there horsys unto sondry treis, CMMALORY-M4,180.2410

and sir Launcelot layde hym downe undir this appyll-tre, and his helmet
undir his hede.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2411

And sir Lyonell waked whyles he $slepte.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2412

So sir Launcelot slepte passyng faste.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2413

And in the meanewhyle com there three knyghtes rydynge, as faste fleynge
as they myght ryde, CMMALORY-M4,180.2414

and there folowed hem three but one knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,180.2415

And when sir Lyonell hym sawe, he thought he sawe never so grete a
knyght nother so well-farynge a man and well appareyld unto all ryghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,180.2416

So within a whyle this stronge knyght <P_181> had overtakyn one of the
three knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,181.2417

and there he smote hym to the colde erth, that he lay stylle;
CMMALORY-M4,181.2418

and than he rode unto the secunde knyght CMMALORY-M4,181.2419

and smote hym so that man and horse felle downe.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2420

And so streyte unto the thirde knyght, CMMALORY-M4,181.2421

and smote hym behynde his horse ars a spere-lengthe; CMMALORY-M4,181.2422

and than he alyght downe CMMALORY-M4,181.2423

and rayned his horse on the brydyll CMMALORY-M4,181.2424

and bounde all three knyghtes faste with the raynes of theire owne
brydelys.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2425

Whan sir Lyonell had sene hym do thus, he thought to assay hym
CMMALORY-M4,181.2426

and made hym redy, CMMALORY-M4,181.2427

and pryvaly he toke his horse CMMALORY-M4,181.2428

and thought nat for to awake sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,181.2429

and so mounted uppon his hors CMMALORY-M4,181.2430

and overtoke the strong knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2431

He bade hym turne, CMMALORY-M4,181.2432

and so he turned CMMALORY-M4,181.2433

and smote sir Lyonell so harde that hors and man he bare to the erth.
CMMALORY-M4,181.2434

And so he alyght downe CMMALORY-M4,181.2435

and bounde hym faste CMMALORY-M4,181.2436

and threw hym over-thwarte his owne horse as he had served the other
three, CMMALORY-M4,181.2437

and so rode with hem tyll he com to his owne castell.
CMMALORY-M4,181.2438

Than he unarmed them CMMALORY-M4,181.2439

and bete them with thornys all naked, CMMALORY-M4,181.2440

and aftir put them in depe preson where were many mo knyghtes that made
grete dole.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2441

So when sir Ector de Marys wyste that sir Launcelot was paste oute of the
course to seke adventures, he was wroth with $hymself CMMALORY-M4,181.2442

and made hym redy to seke sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2443

And as he had redyn longe in a grete foreste, he mette with a man was
lyke a foster.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2444

'Fayre felow,'seyde sir Ector,'doste thou know this contrey or ony
adventures that bene nyghe here honde? 'CMMALORY-M4,181.2445

'Sir,'seyde the foster,'this contrey know I well.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2446

And hereby within this myle is a stronge maner and well dyked,
CMMALORY-M4,181.2447

and by that maner on the lyffte honde there is a fayre fourde for horse
to drynke off, CMMALORY-M4,181.2448

and over that fourde there growys a fayre tre.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2449

And thereon hongyth many fayre shyldys that welded somtyme good knyghtes
, CMMALORY-M4,181.2450

and at the $bole of the tre hongys a basyn of couper and latyne.
CMMALORY-M4,181.2451

And stryke uppon that basyn with the butte of thy spere three tymes,
and sone aftir thou shalt hyre new tydynges; CMMALORY-M4,181.2452

and ellys haste thou the fayreste $grace that ever had knyghte this many
yeres that passed thorow this foreste. 'CMMALORY-M4,181.2453

'Gramercy,'seyde sir Ector CMMALORY-M4,181.2454

and departed.  CMMALORY-M4,181.2455

And com unto this tre CMMALORY-M4,181.2456

and sawe many fayre shyldys, CMMALORY-M4,181.2457

and amonge them all he sawe hys brothirs shylde, sir Lyonell, and many
mo that he knew that were of his felowys of the Rounde Table, the whyche
greved his herte, CMMALORY-M4,181.2458

<P_182>

and promysed to revenge his brother.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2460

Than anone sir Ector bete on the basyn as he were woode,
CMMALORY-M4,182.2461

and than he gaff his horse drynke at the fourde.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2462

And there com a knyghte behynde hym CMMALORY-M4,182.2463

and bade hym com oute of the water and make hym redy.
CMMALORY-M4,182.2464

Sir Ector turned hym shortly, CMMALORY-M4,182.2465

and in feawtir caste his spere CMMALORY-M4,182.2466

and smote the other knyght a grete buffette, that his horse turned
twyse abowte.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2467

'That was well done,'seyde the stronge knyght, CMMALORY-M4,182.2468

'and knyghtly thou haste strykyn me. 'CMMALORY-M4,182.2469

And therewith he russhed his horse on sir Ector CMMALORY-M4,182.2470

and caught hym undir his ryght arme CMMALORY-M4,182.2471

and bare hym clene oute of the sadyll, CMMALORY-M4,182.2472

and so rode with hym away into his castell CMMALORY-M4,182.2473

and threw hym downe in myddyll of the floure.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2474

<em> The name of this knyghte was sir Tarquyn <$$em>.
CMMALORY-M4,182.2475

Than this seyde $Tarquyn seyde unto sir Ector,'For thou hast done
this day more unto me than ony knyght dud this twelve yere, now woll
I graunte the thy lyff, so thou wolt be sworne to be my trew presoner.
'CMMALORY-M4,182.2476

'Nay,'sayde sir Ector,'that woll I never promyse the but that I woll do
myne advauntage. 'CMMALORY-M4,182.2477

'That me repentis,'seyde sir $Tarquyn CMMALORY-M4,182.2478

Than he gan unarme hym CMMALORY-M4,182.2479

and bete hym with thornys all naked, CMMALORY-M4,182.2480

and sytthyn put hym downe into a depe dongeon, CMMALORY-M4,182.2481

and there he knewe many of his felowys.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2482

But when sir Ector saw sir Lyonell, than made he grete sorow.
CMMALORY-M4,182.2483

'Alas, brother! 'seyde sir Ector,'how may this be, CMMALORY-M4,182.2484

and where is my brothir sir Launcelot? 'CMMALORY-M4,182.2485

'Fayre brother, I leffte hym on slepe, when that I frome hym yode,
undir an appil-tre, CMMALORY-M4,182.2486

and what is becom of hym I can nat telle you. 'CMMALORY-M4,182.2487

'Alas,'seyde the presoneres,'but yf sir Launcelot helpe us we shall
never be delyverde, CMMALORY-M4,182.2488

for we know now no knyght that is able to macch with oure maystir
Tarquyne. 'CMMALORY-M4,182.2489

Now leve we thes knyghtes presoners, CMMALORY-M4,182.2490

and speke we of sir Launcelot de Lake that lyeth undir the appil-tre
slepynge.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2491

Aboute the none so there com by hym four queenys of a grete astate;
CMMALORY-M4,182.2492

and for the hete sholde nat nyghe hem, CMMALORY-M4,182.2493

there rode four knyghtes aboute hem CMMALORY-M4,182.2494

and bare a cloth of grene sylke on four sperys betwyxte hem and the sonne.
CMMALORY-M4,182.2495

And the quenys rode on four whyghte mulys.  CMMALORY-M4,182.2496

<P_183>

Thus as they rode they herde a grete horse besyde them grymly nyghe.
CMMALORY-M4,183.2498

Than they loked CMMALORY-M4,183.2499

and were ware of a slepynge knyght lay all armed undir an appil-tre.
CMMALORY-M4,183.2500

And anone as they loked on his face they knew wel hit was sir Launcelot
, CMMALORY-M4,183.2501

and began to stryve for that knyght, CMMALORY-M4,183.2502

and every of hem seyde they wolde have hym to hir love.
CMMALORY-M4,183.2503

'We shall nat stryve,'seyde Morgan le Fay, that was kyng Arthurs sister.
CMMALORY-M4,183.2504

'I shall put an inchauntement uppon hym that he shall nat awake of all
this seven owres, CMMALORY-M4,183.2505

and than I woll lede hym away unto my castell.  CMMALORY-M4,183.2506

And when he is surely within my horde, I shall take the inchauntement
frome hym, and than lette hym chose whych of us he woll have unto
peramour. 'CMMALORY-M4,183.2507

So this enchauntemente was caste uppon sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,183.2508

and than they leyde hym uppon his shylde CMMALORY-M4,183.2509

and bare hym so on horsebak betwyxte two knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,183.2510

and brought hym unto the Castell Charyot; CMMALORY-M4,183.2511

and there they leyde hym in a chambir colde, CMMALORY-M4,183.2512

and at nyght they sente unto hym a fayre dameselle with his souper
redy idyght.  CMMALORY-M4,183.2513

Be that the enchauntement was paste.  CMMALORY-M4,183.2514

And when she com she salewed hym CMMALORY-M4,183.2515

and asked hym what chere.  CMMALORY-M4,183.2516

'I can not sey, fayre damesel,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,183.2517

'for I wote not how I com into this castell but hit be by inchauntemente
. 'CMMALORY-M4,183.2518

'Sir,'seyde she,'ye muste make good chere; CMMALORY-M4,183.2519

and yf ye be suche a knyght as is seyde ye be, I shall telle you more
to-morn be pryme of the day. 'CMMALORY-M4,183.2520

'Gramercy, fayre damesel,'seyde sir Launcelot,'of your good
wylle. 'CMMALORY-M4,183.2521

And so she departed, CMMALORY-M4,183.2522

and there he laye all that nyght withoute ony comforte.
CMMALORY-M4,183.2523

And on the morne erly com thes four quenys passyngly well besene, and all
they byddynge hym good morne, and he them agayne.  CMMALORY-M4,183.2524

'Sir knyght,'the four quenys seyde,'thou muste undirstonde thou art oure
presonere, CMMALORY-M4,183.2525

and we know the well that thou art sir Launcelot du Lake, kynge Banis
sonne.  CMMALORY-M4,183.2526

And because that we undirstonde youre worthynesse, that thou art the
noblest knyght lyvyng, CMMALORY-M4,183.2527

and also we know well there can no lady have thy love but one,
CMMALORY-M4,183.2528

and that is quene Gwenyvere, CMMALORY-M4,183.2529

and now thou shalt hir love lose for ever, and she thyne.
CMMALORY-M4,183.2530

For hit behovyth the now to chose one of us four, CMMALORY-M4,183.2531

for I am quene Morgan le Fay, quene of the londe of Gore,
CMMALORY-M4,183.2532

and here is the quene of <P_184> North Galys, and the quene of Estlonde,
and the quene of the Oute Iles.  CMMALORY-M4,184.2533

Now chose one of us, whyche that thou wolte have to thy peramour, other
ellys to dye in this preson. 'CMMALORY-M4,184.2534

'This is an harde ease,'seyde sir Launcelot,'that other I muste dye
other to chose one of you.  CMMALORY-M4,184.2535

Yet had I lever dye in this preson with worshyp than to have one of you
to my peramoure, magre` myne hede.  CMMALORY-M4,184.2536

And therefore ye be answeryd: CMMALORY-M4,184.2537

I woll none of you, CMMALORY-M4,184.2538

for ye be false $enchauntresses.  CMMALORY-M4,184.2539

And as for my lady, dame Gwenyvere, were I at my lyberte` as I was, I
wolde prove hit on youres that she is the treweste lady unto hir lorde
lyvynge. 'CMMALORY-M4,184.2540

'Well,'seyde the quenys,'ys this your answere, that ye woll refuse
us? 'CMMALORY-M4,184.2541

'Ye, on my lyff,'seyde sir Launcelot,'refused ye bene of me.
'CMMALORY-M4,184.2542

So they departed and leffte hym there alone that made grete sorow.
CMMALORY-M4,184.2543

So aftir that noone com the damesel unto hym with his dyner
CMMALORY-M4,184.2544

and asked hym what chere.  CMMALORY-M4,184.2545

'Truly, damesel,'seyde sir Launcelot,'never so ylle. '
CMMALORY-M4,184.2546

'Sir,'she seyde,'that me repentis, CMMALORY-M4,184.2547

but and ye woll be ruled by me I shall helpe you oute of this dystresse
, CMMALORY-M4,184.2548

and ye shall have no shame nor velony, so that ye $wold $hold my
promyse. 'CMMALORY-M4,184.2549

'Fayre damesel, I graunte you; CMMALORY-M4,184.2550

but sore I am of thes quenys crauftis aferde, CMMALORY-M4,184.2551

for they have destroyed many a good knyght. 'CMMALORY-M4,184.2552

'Sir,'seyde she,'that is soth, CMMALORY-M4,184.2553

and for the renowne and bounte` that they here of you they woll have
your love.  CMMALORY-M4,184.2554

And, sir, they sey youre name is sir Launcelot du Lake, the floure of
knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,184.2555

He wente that his lemman had layne in that bed, CMMALORY-M4,185.2590

'Sir,'sayde the knyghte,'the pavylyon is myne owne.  CMMALORY-M4,185.2601

'Pease, my lady and my love,'seyde sir Belleus, CMMALORY-M4,186.2615

So within a whyle the nyght passed CMMALORY-M4,186.2629

Than sir Launcelot armed hym CMMALORY-M4,186.2631

And his name is sir Tarquyn.  CMMALORY-M4,189.2743

And, as I undirstonde, he hath in his preson of Arthurs courte three score

But when ye have done that journey, ye shall promyse me, as ye ar a trew

'Now, fayre knyght, com on youre way. 'CMMALORY-M4,190.2748

And so she brought hym unto the fourde and the tre where hynge the basyn.
CMMALORY-M4,190.2749

So sir Launcelot lette his horse drynke, CMMALORY-M4,190.2750

Than he rode end-longe the gatys of that maner nyghe halfe an howre.
CMMALORY-M4,190.2754

And than was he ware of a grete knyght that droffe an horse afore hym,
CMMALORY-M4,190.2755

and overthwarte the horse lay an armed knyght bounden.
CMMALORY-M4,190.2756

And ever as they com nere and nere sir Launcelot thought he sholde
know hym.  CMMALORY-M4,190.2757

Than was he ware that hit was sir Gaherys, Gawaynes brothir, a knyght

'Now, fayre damesell,'seyde sir Launcelot,'I se yondir a knyght faste

And at the fyrste begynnynge I promyse you, by the leve of God, for to

But yf his maystir sytte the bettir in his sadyl, I shall delyver all

for I am sure he hath two bretherne of myne presoners with hym.
'CMMALORY-M4,190.2763

But by that tyme that eythir had sene other they gryped theyre sperys
unto them.  CMMALORY-M4,190.2764

'Now, fayre knyght,'seyde sir Launcelot,'put that wounded knyghte of

and lette hym reste a whyle, CMMALORY-M4,190.2766

and lette us too preve oure strengthis.  CMMALORY-M4,190.2767

For, as hit is enfourmed me, thou doyste and haste done me grete despyte ,
and shame unto knyghtes of the Rounde Table.  CMMALORY-M4,190.2768

And therefore now defende the! 'CMMALORY-M4,190.2769

'And thou be of $the Rounde Table,'seyde Terquyn,'I $defy the and all

'That is overmuche seyde,'sir Launcelot seyde,'of the at thys

And than they put there sperys in their restys CMMALORY-M4,190.2772

and come togedyrs with hir horsis as faste as they myght ren;
CMMALORY-M4,190.2773

and aythir smote other in myddys of their shyldis, that both their
horsys backys braste undir them, and the knyghtes were bothe astoned.
CMMALORY-M4,190.2774

And as sone as they myght they avoyded their horsys CMMALORY-M4,190.2775

and toke their shyldys before them CMMALORY-M4,190.2776

and drew oute their swerdys CMMALORY-M4,190.2777

CMMALORY-M4,191.2780

And so within a whyle they had bothe many grymme woundys
CMMALORY-M4,191.2781

and bledde passyng grevously.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2782

Thus they fared two owres and more trasyng and rasyng eyther othir where
they myght hitte ony bare place.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2783

Than at the laste they were brethles bothe, CMMALORY-M4,191.2784

and stode lenyng on her swerdys.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2785

'Now, felow,'seyde sir Terquyne,'holde thy honde a whyle,
CMMALORY-M4,191.2786

and telle me that I shall aske of the. 'CMMALORY-M4,191.2787

'Sey on,'seyde sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2788

Than sir Terquyn seyde,'Thou art the byggyst man that ever I mette

all other knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2789

So be hit that thou be not he, I woll lyghtly acorde with the,
CMMALORY-M4,191.2790

and for thy love I woll delyver all the presoners that I have,
that is three score and four, so thou wolde telle me thy name.
CMMALORY-M4,191.2791

And thou and I woll be felowys togedyrs and never to fayle the whyle

'Ye sey well,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,191.2793

'but sytthyn hit is so that I have thy frendeshyppe and may have , what
knyght is that that thou hatyste abovyn all thynge? ' CMMALORY-M4,191.2794

'Feythfully,'seyde sir Terquyn,'his name is sir Launcelot de Lake ,
CMMALORY-M4,191.2795

for he slowe my brothir sir Carados at the Dolerous Towre, that was one
of the beste knyghtes on lyve; CMMALORY-M4,191.2796

and therefore hym I excepte of alle knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,191.2797

for may I hym onys mete, the tone shall make an ende, I make myne avow.
CMMALORY-M4,191.2798

And for sir Launcelottis sake I have slayne an hondred good knyghtes,
CMMALORY-M4,191.2799

and as many I have maymed all uttirly, that they myght never aftir helpe
themself, CMMALORY-M4,191.2800

and many have dyed in preson.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2801

And yette have I three score and four, CMMALORY-M4,191.2802

and all $shal be delyverde, so thou wolte telle me thy name, so be hit
that thou be nat sir Launcelot. 'CMMALORY-M4,191.2803

'Now se I well,'seyde sir Launcelot,'that suche a man I myght be,
I myght have pease; CMMALORY-M4,191.2804

and suche a man I <em> myghte be <$$em> that there sholde be mortall

And now, sir knyght, at thy requeste I woll that thou wete and know that
I am sir Launcelot du Lake, kynge Bannys son of Benwyke, and verry knyght
of the Table Rounde.  CMMALORY-M4,191.2806

And now I defyghe the, CMMALORY-M4,191.2807

and do thy beste! 'CMMALORY-M4,191.2808

'A! 'seyde sir Tarquyne,'thou arte to me moste welcom of <P_192> ony
knyght, CMMALORY-M4,192.2809

for we shall never departe tylle the tone of us be dede. '
CMMALORY-M4,192.2810

Than they hurteled togedyrs as two wylde bullys, russhynge and laysshyng
with hir shyldis and swerdys, that somtyme they felle bothe on their
nosys.  CMMALORY-M4,192.2811

Thus they foughte stylle two owres and more CMMALORY-M4,192.2812

and never wolde have reste, CMMALORY-M4,192.2813

and sir Tarquyne gaff sir Launcelot many woundys, that all the grounde
$there $as {TEXT:thereas} they faughte was all besparcled with bloode.
CMMALORY-M4,192.2814

Than at the laste sir Terquyne wexed faynte CMMALORY-M4,192.2815

and gaff somwhat abakke, CMMALORY-M4,192.2816

and bare his shylde low for wery.  CMMALORY-M4,192.2817

That aspyed sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,192.2818

and lepte uppon hym fersly CMMALORY-M4,192.2819

and gate hym by the bavoure of hys helmette CMMALORY-M4,192.2820

and plucked hym downe on his kneis, CMMALORY-M4,192.2821

and anone he raced of his helme CMMALORY-M4,192.2822

and smote his necke in sundir.  CMMALORY-M4,192.2823

And when sir Launcelot had done this he yode unto the damesell
CMMALORY-M4,192.2824

and seyde,'Damesell, I am redy to go with you where ye woll have me ,
CMMALORY-M4,192.2825

but I have no horse. 'CMMALORY-M4,192.2826

'Fayre sir,'seyde this wounded knyght,'take my horse, CMMALORY-M4,192.2827

and than lette me go into this maner and delyver all thes presoners.
'CMMALORY-M4,192.2828

So he toke sir Gaheris horse CMMALORY-M4,192.2829

and prayde hym nat to be greved.  CMMALORY-M4,192.2830

'Nay, fayre lorde, I woll that ye have hym at your commaunde-mente,
CMMALORY-M4,192.2831

for ye have bothe saved me and my horse.  CMMALORY-M4,192.2832

And this day I sey ye ar the beste knyght in the worlde,
CMMALORY-M4,192.2833

for ye have slayne this day in my syght the myghtyeste man and the beste

But, fayre sir,'seyde sir Gaherys,'I pray you telle me your name.
'CMMALORY-M4,192.2835

'Sir, my name is sir Launcelot du Lake that ought to helpe you of ryght
for kynge Arthurs sake, and in especiall for my lorde sir Gawayne his

And when that ye com within yondir maner, I am sure ye shall fynde there
many knyghtes of the Rounde Table; CMMALORY-M4,192.2837

for I have sene many of their shyldys that I know hongys on yondir tre.
CMMALORY-M4,192.2838

There is sir Kayes shylde, <em> and sir Brandeles shylde <$$em>,
and sir Galyhuddys shylde, and sir Bryan de Lystenoyse his shylde,
and sir Alydukis shylde, with many mo that I am nat now avysed of, and

for by the feste of Pentecoste I caste me to be there; for as at
thys tyme I muste ryde with this damesel for to save my promyse.
'CMMALORY-M4,193.2840

And so they departed frome Gaherys; CMMALORY-M4,193.2841

and Gaherys yode into the maner, CMMALORY-M4,193.2842

and there he founde a yoman porter kepyng many keyes.
CMMALORY-M4,193.2843

Than sir Gaherys threw the porter unto the grounde CMMALORY-M4,193.2844

and toke the keyes frome hym; CMMALORY-M4,193.2845

and hastely he opynde the preson dore, CMMALORY-M4,193.2846

and there he lette all the presoners oute, CMMALORY-M4,193.2847

and every man lowsed other of their bondys.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2848

And when they sawe sir Gaherys, all they thanked hym, CMMALORY-M4,193.2849

for they wente that he had slayne sir Terquyne because that he was
wounded.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2850

'Not so, syrs,'seyde sir Gaherys, CMMALORY-M4,193.2851

'hit was sir Launcelot that slew hym worshypfully with his owne hondys ,
CMMALORY-M4,193.2852

and he gretys you all well CMMALORY-M4,193.2853

and prayeth you to haste you to the courte.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2854

And as unto you, sir Lyonell and sir Ector de Marys, he prayeth you to
abyde hym at the courte of kynge Arthure. 'CMMALORY-M4,193.2855

'That shall we nat do,'seyde his bretherne.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2856

'We woll fynde hym and we may lyve. 'CMMALORY-M4,193.2857

'So shall I,'seyde sir Kay,'fynde hym or I com to the courte, as I am
trew knyght. 'CMMALORY-M4,193.2858

Than they sought the house $there $as {TEXT:thereas} the armour was,
CMMALORY-M4,193.2859

and than they armed them; CMMALORY-M4,193.2860

and every knyght founde hys owne horse and all that longed unto hym.
CMMALORY-M4,193.2861

So forthwith there com a foster with four horsys lade with fatte venyson.
CMMALORY-M4,193.2862

And anone sir Kay seyde,'Here is good mete for us for one meale,
CMMALORY-M4,193.2863

for we had not many a day no good repaste. 'CMMALORY-M4,193.2864

And so that venyson was rosted, sodde, and bakyn; CMMALORY-M4,193.2865

and so aftir souper som abode there all nyght.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2866

But sir Lyonell and sir Ector de Marys and sir Kay rode aftir sir
Launcelot to fynde hym yf they myght.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2867

Now turne we to sir Launcelot that rode with the damesel in a fayre
hygheway.  CMMALORY-M4,193.2868

'Sir,'seyde the damesell,'here by this way hauntys a knyght that
dystressis all ladyes and jantylwomen, CMMALORY-M4,193.2869

and at the leste he robbyth them CMMALORY-M4,193.2870

other lyeth by hem. 'CMMALORY-M4,193.2871

'What? 'seyde sir Launcelot,'is he a theff and a knyght?  And a ravyssher
of women?  CMMALORY-M4,193.2872

He doth shame unto the Order of Knyght-hode, and contrary unto his oth.
CMMALORY-M4,193.2873

Hit is pyte` that he lyvyth!  CMMALORY-M4,193.2874

But, <P_194> fayre damesel, ye shall ryde on before youreself,
CMMALORY-M4,194.2875

and I woll kepe myself in coverte; CMMALORY-M4,194.2876

and yf that he trowble yow other dystresse you I shall be your rescowe
and lerne hym to be ruled as a knyght. 'CMMALORY-M4,194.2877

So thys mayde rode on by the way a souffte amblynge pace,
CMMALORY-M4,194.2878

and within a whyle com oute a knyght on $horsebak owte of the woode and
his page with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2879

And there he put the damesell frome hir horse, CMMALORY-M4,194.2880

and than she cryed.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2881

With that com sir Launcelot as faste as he myght tyll he com to
the knyght, sayng,'A, false knyght and traytoure unto knyghthode,
who dud lerne the to distresse ladyes, damesels and jantyllwomen?
'CMMALORY-M4,194.2882

Whan the knyght sy sir Launcelot thus rebukynge hym he answerde nat,
CMMALORY-M4,194.2883

but drew his swerde CMMALORY-M4,194.2884

and rode unto sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2885

And sir Launcelot threw his spere frome hym CMMALORY-M4,194.2886

and drew his swerde, CMMALORY-M4,194.2887

and strake hym suche a buffette on the helmette that he claffe his hede
and necke unto the throte.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2888

'Now haste thou thy paymente that longe thou haste deserved! '
CMMALORY-M4,194.2889

'That is trouth,'seyde the damesell, CMMALORY-M4,194.2890

'for lyke as Terquyn wacched to dystresse good knyghtes, so dud this
knyght attende to destroy and dystresse ladyes, damesels and jantyllwomen
; CMMALORY-M4,194.2891

and his name was sir Perys de Foreste Savage. 'CMMALORY-M4,194.2892

'Now, damesell,'seyde sir Launcelot'woll ye ony more servyse of
me? 'CMMALORY-M4,194.2893

'Nay, sir,'she seyde,'at thys tyme, CMMALORY-M4,194.2894

but Allmyghty Jesu preserve you wheresomever ye ryde or goo,
CMMALORY-M4,194.2895

for the curteyst knyght thou arte, and mekyste unto all ladyes and
jantylwomen that now lyvyth.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2896

But one thyng, sir knyght, $me $thynkes {TEXT:methynkes} ye lak, ye that
ar a knyght wyveles, that ye woll nat love som mayden other jantylwoman.
CMMALORY-M4,194.2897

For I cowde never here sey that ever ye loved ony of no maner of degre`
, CMMALORY-M4,194.2898

and that is grete pyte`.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2899

But hit is noysed that ye love quene Gwenyvere, and that she hath
ordeyned by enchauntemente that ye shall never love none other but hir,
nother none other damesell ne lady shall rejoyce you; $wherefore there
be many in this londe, of hyghe astate and lowe, that make grete sorow.
'CMMALORY-M4,194.2900

'Fayre damesell,'seyde sir Launcelot,'I may nat warne peple to speke of
me what hit pleasyth hem.  CMMALORY-M4,194.2901

But for to be a weddyd man, I thynke hit nat, CMMALORY-M4,194.2902

for than I muste couche with hir and leve armys and turnamentis, batellys

And as for to sey to take my <P_195> pleasaunce with peramours, that
woll I refuse: in prencipall for drede of God, CMMALORY-M4,195.2904

for knyghtes that bene adventures sholde nat be advoutrers nothir

for than they be nat happy nother fortunate unto the werrys;
CMMALORY-M4,195.2906

for other they shall be overcome with a sympler knyght than they be

other ellys they shall sle by unhappe and hir cursednesse bettir men
than they be hemself.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2908

And so who that usyth peramours shall be unhappy, and all thynge un-happy
that is aboute them. 'CMMALORY-M4,195.2909

And so sir Launcelot and she departed.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2910

And than he rode in a depe foreste two dayes and more,
CMMALORY-M4,195.2911

and hadde strayte lodgynge.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2912

So on the thirde day he rode on a longe brydge, CMMALORY-M4,195.2913

and there sterte uppon hym suddeynly a passyng foule carle.
CMMALORY-M4,195.2914

And he smote his horse on the nose, that he turned aboute,
CMMALORY-M4,195.2915

and asked hym why he rode over that brydge withoute lycence.
CMMALORY-M4,195.2916

'Why sholde I nat ryde this way? 'seyde sir Launcelotte,
CMMALORY-M4,195.2917

'I may not ryde besyde. 'CMMALORY-M4,195.2918

'Thou shalt not chose,'seyde the carle, CMMALORY-M4,195.2919

and laysshed at hym with a grete club shodde with iron.
CMMALORY-M4,195.2920

Than sir Launcelot drew his swerde CMMALORY-M4,195.2921

and put the stroke abacke, CMMALORY-M4,195.2922

and clave his hede unto the pappys.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2923

And at the ende of the brydge was a fayre vyllage, CMMALORY-M4,195.2924

and all peple, men and women, cryed on sir Launcelot CMMALORY-M4,195.2925

and sayde,'Sir knyght, a worse dede duddyst thou never for thyself,
CMMALORY-M4,195.2926

for thou haste slayne the cheyff porter of oure castell. '
CMMALORY-M4,195.2927

Sir Launcelot lete hem sey what they wolde, CMMALORY-M4,195.2928

and streyte he rode into the castelle.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2929

And when he come into the castell he alyght CMMALORY-M4,195.2930

and tyed his horse to a rynge on the walle.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2931

And there he sawe a fayre grene courte, CMMALORY-M4,195.2932

and thydir he dressid hym, CMMALORY-M4,195.2933

for there hym thought was a fayre place to feyght in.
CMMALORY-M4,195.2934

So he loked aboute hym CMMALORY-M4,195.2935

and sye muche peple in dorys and in wyndowys that sayde,'Fayre knyghte ,
thou arte unhappy to com here! 'CMMALORY-M4,195.2936

Anone withall there com uppon hym two grete gyauntis well armed
all save there $hedys, with two horryble clubbys in their hondys.
CMMALORY-M4,195.2937

Sir Launcelot put his shylde before hym CMMALORY-M4,195.2938

and put the stroke away of that one gyaunte, CMMALORY-M4,195.2939

and with hys swerde he clave his hede in sundir.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2940

Whan his felowe sawe that, he ran away as he were woode, and sir Launcelot

and smote hym on the shuldir CMMALORY-M4,195.2942

and clave hym to the navyll.  CMMALORY-M4,195.2943

<P_196>

Than sir Launcelot wente into the halle, CMMALORY-M4,196.2945

and there com afore hym three score of ladyes and damesels,
CMMALORY-M4,196.2946

and all kneled unto hym CMMALORY-M4,196.2947

and thanked God and hym of his delyveraunce.  CMMALORY-M4,196.2948

'For,'they seyde,'the moste party of us have bene here this seven yere

And we all pray you to telle us your name, that we may telle oure frendis

'Fayre damesellys,'he seyde,'my name is sir Launcelot du Laake.
'CMMALORY-M4,196.2956

'A, sir,'seyde they all,'well mayste thou be he, CMMALORY-M4,196.2957

for ellys save yourself, as we demed, there myght never knyght have the

And what tresoure that there is in this castel I yeff hit you for a

And the lorde that is the ownere of this castel, I wolde he ressayved

'Fayre sir,'they seyde,'the name of this castell is called Tyntagyll,

'Well,'seyde sir Launcelot,'I undirstonde to whom this castel

And so he departed frome them CMMALORY-M4,196.2971

and betaught hem unto God.  CMMALORY-M4,196.2972

And than he mounted uppon his horse CMMALORY-M4,196.2973

and rode into many stronge countreyes and thorow many watyrs and valeyes

and evyll was he lodged.  CMMALORY-M4,196.2975

And at the laste by fortune hym happynd ayenste nyght to come to a fayre

and therein he founde an olde jantylwoman that lodged hym with goode

and there he had good chere for hym and his horse.  CMMALORY-M4,196.2978

And when tyme was his oste brought hym into a garret over the gate to

There sir <P_197> Launcelot unarmed hym CMMALORY-M4,197.2980

So aftir there com one on horsebak CMMALORY-M4,197.2984

and defended hym.  CMMALORY-M4,197.2990

'Truly,'seyde sir Launcelot,'yondir one knyght shall I helpe,

And therewith he toke his harneys CMMALORY-M4,197.2994

Than sir Kay dressid hym to have holpen sir Launcelot.
CMMALORY-M4,197.3004

'Nay, sir,'sayde he,'I woll none of your helpe.  CMMALORY-M4,197.3005

Therefore, as ye woll have my helpe, lette me alone with hem.

'Fayre knyght, that were us loth, CMMALORY-M4,197.3013

for as for that knyght, we chaced hym hydir, CMMALORY-M4,197.3014

Therefore to yelde us unto hym hit were no reson. 'CMMALORY-M4,197.3016

'Well, as to that, avyse you well, CMMALORY-M4,197.3017

for ye may chose whether ye woll dye other lyve.  CMMALORY-M4,197.3018

For and ye be yolden hit shall be unto sir Kay. 'CMMALORY-M4,197.3019

'Now, fayre knyght,'they seyde,'in savyng of oure lyvys, we woll do as

'Than shall ye,'seyde sir Launcelot,'on Whytsonday nexte commynge go

'Sir,'they seyde,'hit shall be done, by the feyth of oure bodyes, and

And there they sware every knyght uppon his swerde, CMMALORY-M4,198.3024

and so sir Launcelot suffyrd hem to departe.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3025

And than sir Launcelot cnocked at the gate with the pomell of his swerde

but I arose and lepe oute at my wyndow for to helpe an olde felowe of

So when they come nye the lyght sir Kay knew well hit was sir Launcelot

and therewith he kneled downe CMMALORY-M4,198.3033

and thanked hym of all his kyndenesse, that he had holpyn hym twyse

'Sir,'he seyde,'I have nothyng done but that me ought for to do.
CMMALORY-M4,198.3035

And ye ar welcom, CMMALORY-M4,198.3036

Whan sir Kay was unarmed he asked aftir mete.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3038

Anone there was mete fette for hym CMMALORY-M4,198.3039

and he ete strongly.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3040

And when he had sowped they wente to their beddys CMMALORY-M4,198.3041

and were lodged togydyrs in one bed.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3042

So on the morne sir Launcelot arose erly CMMALORY-M4,198.3043

and leffte sir Kay slepyng.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3044

And sir Launcelot toke sir Kayes armoure and his shylde

for on hym knyghtes woll be bolde and deme that hit is I,
CMMALORY-M4,198.3055

and that woll begyle them.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3056

And bycause of his armoure and shylde I am sure I shall ryde in pease.
'CMMALORY-M4,198.3057

And than sone sir Kay departed CMMALORY-M4,198.3058

and thanked his oste.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3059

Now turne we unto sir Launcelot du Lake that com home two dayes before
the feste of Pentecoste, CMMALORY-M4,198.3060

and the kynge and all the courte were passyng fayne.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3061

And when Gawayne, sir Uwayne, sir Sagramoure, and sir Ector de Mares sye

smote hem downe all wyth one spere.  CMMALORY-M4,198.3062

Than there was lawghyng and smylyng amonge them, CMMALORY-M4,198.3063

Now turne we unto sir Launcelot that had ryddyn longe in a grete foreste.
CMMALORY-M4,198.3064

And at the laste he com unto a low countrey full of fayre ryvers and

and before hym he sawe a longe brydge, CMMALORY-M4,198.3066

and three pavylyons stood thereon, of sylke and sendell of dyverse hew.
CMMALORY-M4,198.3067

And withoute the pavylyons hynge three whyght shyldys on trouncheouns

CMMALORY-M4,198.3069

and at every pavylyon dore stoode three freysh knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,198.3070

<P_199>

And so sir Launcelot passed by hem CMMALORY-M4,199.3072

and spake no worde.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3073

But whan he was paste the three knyghtes knew hym CMMALORY-M4,199.3074

and seyde hit was the proude sir Kay: CMMALORY-M4,199.3075

'He wenyth no knyght so good as he, CMMALORY-M4,199.3076

and the contrary is oftyn proved.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3077

Be my fayth,'seyde one of the knyghtes, his name was sir Gawtere,'I woll
ryde aftir hym and assay hym for all his pryde; CMMALORY-M4,199.3078

and ye may beholde how that I spede. 'CMMALORY-M4,199.3079

So sir Gawtere armed hym CMMALORY-M4,199.3080

and hynge his shylde uppon his sholdir, CMMALORY-M4,199.3081

and mounted uppon a grete horse, CMMALORY-M4,199.3082

CMMALORY-M4,199.3085

for thou shalt nat passe all quyte. 'CMMALORY-M4,199.3086

So sir Launcelot turned hym, CMMALORY-M4,199.3087

and eythir feautyrd their sperys CMMALORY-M4,199.3088

and com togedyrs with all their myghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3089

And sir Gawters speare brake, CMMALORY-M4,199.3090

And whan he was at the erthe his brethyrn seyde,'Yondir knyght is nat

'I dare ley my hede,'seyde sir Gylmere,'yondir knyght hath slayne sir

'Whether hit be so other no,'seyde sir Raynolde,'lette us mounte on oure

For payne of deth, we all shall have worke inow to macche that knyght;

for ever $me $semyth {TEXT:mesemyth} by his persone hit is sir

CMMALORY-M4,199.3097

Than anone they toke their horsys CMMALORY-M4,199.3098

and overtoke sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3099

And sir Gylmere put forth his speare CMMALORY-M4,199.3100

and ran to sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,199.3101

and sir Launcelot smote hym downe, that he lay in a sowghe.
CMMALORY-M4,199.3102

'sir knyght,'seyde sir Raynolde,'thou arte a stronge man,

but nedys I muste take suche parte as they do.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3106

And therefore, knyght, kepe thyselfe! 'CMMALORY-M4,199.3107

And so they hurtylde togydyrs with all their myghtes CMMALORY-M4,199.3108

and all to-shevird bothe there spearys, CMMALORY-M4,199.3109

and than they drew hir swerdys CMMALORY-M4,199.3110

and laysshed togydir egirly.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3111

Anone there $with all arose sir Gawtere CMMALORY-M4,199.3112

and come unto his brother sir Gyllymere, CMMALORY-M4,199.3113

and bade hym aryse, CMMALORY-M4,199.3114

Therewithall they hurteled unto sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,199.3116

<P_200>

And whan he sawe them com he smote a sore stroke unto sir Raynolde,

Wyth that sir Raynolde gan up sterte with his hede all blody

'Now let be,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,200.3123

'I was not far frome the whan thou were made knyght, sir Raynolde,
CMMALORY-M4,200.3124

and also I know thou arte a good knyght, CMMALORY-M4,200.3125

'Gramercy,'seyde sir Raynolde,'of your goodnesse, CMMALORY-M4,200.3127

'As for that, be as be may.  CMMALORY-M4,200.3130

For ye shall yelde you unto dame Gwenyvere, CMMALORY-M4,200.3131

and loke that ye be there on Whytsonday and yelde you unto hir as

Than they swore hit sholde be done, CMMALORY-M4,200.3133

and $so passed forth sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,200.3134

and ecchone of the bretherne halpe other as well as they myght.
CMMALORY-M4,200.3135

So sir Launcelotte rode into a depe foreste, CMMALORY-M4,200.3136

and there by hym in a slade he sey four knyghtes hovynge undir an oke,

And anone as these four knyghtes had aspyed sir Launcelot they wende by

'Now, be my fayth,'sayde sir Sagramoure,'I woll preve sir Kayes

and gate his spere in his honde CMMALORY-M4,200.3142

Now shall ye se what I may do to hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,200.3150

So sir Ector gate his spere in his honde CMMALORY-M4,200.3151

and walopte towarde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,200.3152

and sir Launcelot smote hym evyn thorow the shylde and his sholdir,
that man and horse wente to the erthe, CMMALORY-M4,200.3153

and ever his spere helde.  CMMALORY-M4,200.3154

<P_201>

'Be my fayth,'sayde sir Uwayne,'yondir is a stronge knyght,
CMMALORY-M4,201.3156

and I am sure he hath slayne Kay.  CMMALORY-M4,201.3157

And I se be his grete strengthe hit woll be harde to macche hym.
'CMMALORY-M4,201.3158

And therewithall sir Uwayne gate his speare CMMALORY-M4,201.3159

and rode towarde sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,201.3160

And sir Launcelot knew hym well CMMALORY-M4,201.3161

and lette $his horse renne on the playne CMMALORY-M4,201.3162

and gaff hym suche a buffette that he was astooned, CMMALORY-M4,201.3163

and longe he wyste nat where he was.  CMMALORY-M4,201.3164

'Now se I welle,'seyde sir Gawayne,'I muste encountir with that

and dressed his shylde CMMALORY-M4,201.3166

and gate a good speare in his honde CMMALORY-M4,201.3167

and lete renne at sir Launcelot with all his myght; CMMALORY-M4,201.3168

and eyther knyght smote other in myddys of the shylde.
CMMALORY-M4,201.3169

But sir Gawaynes spere braste, CMMALORY-M4,201.3170

and sir Launcelot charged so sore uppon hym that his horse reversed
up-so-downe, CMMALORY-M4,201.3171

and muche sorow had sir Gawayne to avoyde his horse.  CMMALORY-M4,201.3172

And so sir Launcelot passed on a pace CMMALORY-M4,201.3173

and smyled CMMALORY-M4,201.3174

and seyde,'God gyff hym joy that this spere made, CMMALORY-M4,201.3175

for there cam never a bettir in my honde. 'CMMALORY-M4,201.3176

Than the four knyghtes wente echone to other CMMALORY-M4,201.3177

and comforted each other.  CMMALORY-M4,201.3178

'What sey ye by this geste,'seyde sir Gawayne,'that with one spere hath
felde us all four? 'CMMALORY-M4,201.3179

'We commaunde hym to the devyll,'they seyde all, CMMALORY-M4,201.3180

'for he is a man of grete myght. 'CMMALORY-M4,201.3181

'Ye may say hit well,'seyde sir Gawayne,'that he $is a man of myght,
CMMALORY-M4,201.3182

for I dare ley my hede hit is sir Launcelot: CMMALORY-M4,201.3183

I know hym well by his rydyng. 'CMMALORY-M4,201.3184

'Latte hym go,'seyde sir Uwayne, CMMALORY-M4,201.3185

'for whan we com to the courte we shall wete. 'CMMALORY-M4,201.3186

Than had they much sorow to gete their horsis agayne.
CMMALORY-M4,201.3187

Now leve we there CMMALORY-M4,201.3188

and speke we of sir Launcelot that rode a grete whyle in a depe foreste.
CMMALORY-M4,201.3189

And as he rode he sawe a blak brachette sekyng in maner as hit had bene

And therewith he rode aftir the brachette CMMALORY-M4,201.3191

and he sawe lye on the grounde a large feaute of bloode.
CMMALORY-M4,201.3192

And than sir Launcelot rode faster, CMMALORY-M4,201.3193

and ever the brachette loked behynde hir, CMMALORY-M4,201.3194

and so she wente thorow a grete marys, CMMALORY-M4,201.3195

And than was he ware of an olde maner, CMMALORY-M4,201.3197

and thydir ran the brachette and so over a brydge.  CMMALORY-M4,201.3198

So sir Launcelot rode over that brydge that was olde and feble,
CMMALORY-M4,201.3199

and whan he com in the myddys of <P_202> a grete halle there he seye

and that brachette lycked his woundis.  CMMALORY-M4,202.3201

And therewithall com oute a lady wepyng and wryngyng hir hondys,
CMMALORY-M4,202.3202

and sayde,'Knyght, to muche sorow hast thou brought me. '
CMMALORY-M4,202.3203

'Why sey ye so? 'seyde sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,202.3204

'I dede never this knyght no harme, CMMALORY-M4,202.3205

for hydir by the feaute of blood this brachet brought me.
CMMALORY-M4,202.3206

And therefore, fayre lady, be nat dyspleased with me, CMMALORY-M4,202.3207

'Truly, sir,'she seyde,'I trowe hit be nat ye that hath slayne my

for he that dud that dede is sore wounded CMMALORY-M4,202.3210

that shall I ensure hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,202.3212

'What was youre husbondes name? 'seyde sir Launcelot.
CMMALORY-M4,202.3213

'Sir, his name was called sir Gylberd the Bastarde, one of the beste

and he that hath slayne hym I know nat his name. 'CMMALORY-M4,202.3215

'Now God sende you bettir comforte,'seyde sir Launcelot.
CMMALORY-M4,202.3216

And so he departed CMMALORY-M4,202.3217

and wente into the foreste agayne, CMMALORY-M4,202.3218

and there he mette with a damesell the whyche knew hym well.
CMMALORY-M4,202.3219

And she seyde on lowde,'Well be ye founde, my lorde.  CMMALORY-M4,202.3220

And now I requyre you of your knyghthode helpe my brother that is sore

for this day he fought with sir Gylberte the Bastarde CMMALORY-M4,202.3222

and slew hym in playne batayle, CMMALORY-M4,202.3223

and there was my brother sore wounded.  CMMALORY-M4,202.3224

And there is a lady, a sorseres, that dwellyth in a castel here bysyde ,

'CMMALORY-M4,202.3228

'This is a mervelouse thyng,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,202.3229

'but what is your brothirs name? 'CMMALORY-M4,202.3230

'Sir,'she seyde,'sir Melyot de Logyrs. 'CMMALORY-M4,202.3231

'That me repentys,'seyde sir Launcelotte, CMMALORY-M4,202.3232

'for he is a felow of the Table Rounde, CMMALORY-M4,202.3233

Than she sayde,'Sir, folow ye evyn this hygheway, and hit woll brynge

And yf you spede nat I know no knyght lyvynge that may encheve that

Ryght so sir Launcelot departed, CMMALORY-M4,203.3238

and whan he com to the Chapell Perelus he alyght downe

With that he sawe by hym there stonde a thirty grete knyghtes, more by

And whan he sawe their countenaunce he dredde hym sore,

And they all were armed all in blak harneyse, redy with her shyldis and

And as sir Launcelot wolde have gone thorow them they skaterd on every

And there he sawe no lyght but a dymme lampe brennyng,

Anone as ever he was in the chapell-yerde all the knyghtes spake to hym

'Whether that I lyve other dye,'seyde sir Launcelot,'with no wordys

Therefore fyght for hit and ye lyst. 'CMMALORY-M4,203.3266

Than ryght so he passed thorowoute them.  CMMALORY-M4,203.3267

And byyonde the chappell-yarde there mette hym a fayre damesell

'I leve hit not,'seyde sir Launcelot,'for no thretyng. '

'Than were I a foole and I wolde leve this swerde. ' CMMALORY-M4,203.3272

<P_204>

'Now, jantyll knyghte,'seyde the damesell,'I requyre the to kysse me

'Nay,'seyde sir Launcelot,'that God me forbede. ' CMMALORY-M4,204.3275

'Well, sir,'seyde she,'and thou haddyst kyssed me thy lyff dayes had

for I ordeyned this chapell for thy sake and for sir Gawayne.
CMMALORY-M4,204.3278

And onys I had hym within me, CMMALORY-M4,204.3279

and at that tyme he fought with this knyght that lyeth dede in yondir

and at that tyme he smote the lyffte honde of sir Gylberte.
CMMALORY-M4,204.3281

'And, sir Launcelot, now I telle the: I have loved the this seven yere,

CMMALORY-M4,204.3284

Than wolde I have bawmed hit and sered hit, and so to have kepte hit my

and dayly I sholde have clypped the and kyssed the, dispyte of quene

'Ye sey well,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,204.3287

'Jesu preserve me frome your subtyle crauftys! 'CMMALORY-M4,204.3288

And therewithall he toke his horse CMMALORY-M4,204.3289

and so departed frome hir.  CMMALORY-M4,204.3290

And as the booke seyth, whan sir Launcelot was departed she toke suche
sorow that she deyde within a fourtenyte; CMMALORY-M4,204.3291

and hir name was called Hallewes the Sorseres, lady of the castell
Nygurmous.  CMMALORY-M4,204.3292

And anone sir Launcelot mette with the damesel, sir Melyottis systir,
CMMALORY-M4,204.3293

and whan she sawe hym she clapped hir hondys CMMALORY-M4,204.3294

and wepte for joy.  CMMALORY-M4,204.3295

And than they rode into a castell thereby where lay sir Melyot,
CMMALORY-M4,204.3296

and anone as sir Launcelot sye hym he knew hym, CMMALORY-M4,204.3297

but he was passyng paale as the erthe for bledynge.  CMMALORY-M4,204.3298

Whan sir Melyot saw sir Launcelot he kneled uppon his kneis
CMMALORY-M4,204.3299

and cryed on hyghte:'A, lorde, sir Launcelot, helpe me anone!
'CMMALORY-M4,204.3300

Than sir Launcelot lepe unto hym CMMALORY-M4,204.3301

and towched his woundys with sir Gylbardys swerde, CMMALORY-M4,204.3302

and than he wyped his woundys with a parte of the bloody cloth that sir
Gylbarde was wrapped in; CMMALORY-M4,204.3303

and anone an holer man in his lyff was he never.  CMMALORY-M4,204.3304

And than there was grete joy betwene hem, CMMALORY-M4,204.3305

and they made sir Launcelot all the chere that they myghte.
CMMALORY-M4,204.3306

And so on the morne sir Launcelot toke his leve CMMALORY-M4,204.3307

and bade sir Melyot hyghe hym'to the courte of my lorde Arthure,
CMMALORY-M4,204.3308

for hit drawyth nyghe to the feste of Pentecoste.  CMMALORY-M4,204.3309

<P_205>

And there, by the grace of God, ye shall fynde me. ' CMMALORY-M4,205.3311

And therewith they departed.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3312

And so sir Launcelot rode thorow many stronge contrayes, over mores and
valeis, tyll by fortune he com to a fayre castell.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3313

And as he paste beyonde the castell hym thought he herde bellys rynge,

And she flowe unto the elme to take hir perche, the lunes overcast aboute

and whan she wolde have tane hir flyght she hynge by the leggis faste.
CMMALORY-M4,205.3317

And sir Launcelot syghe how $she hynge, CMMALORY-M4,205.3318

and behelde the fayre faucon perygot; CMMALORY-M4,205.3319

and he was sory for hir.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3320

The meanewhyle cam a lady oute of a castell CMMALORY-M4,205.3321

and cryed on hyghe: CMMALORY-M4,205.3322

'A, Launcelot, Launcelot!  as thow arte a floure of all knyghtes, helpe
me to gete me my hauke; CMMALORY-M4,205.3323

for and my hauke be loste my lorde wolde destroy me, CMMALORY-M4,205.3324

for I kepte the hauke CMMALORY-M4,205.3325

and she slypped fro me.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3326

And yf my lorde my husbande wete hit, he is so hasty that he wyll sle

'What is your lordis name? 'seyde sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3328

'Sir,'she seyde,'his name is sir Phelot, a knyght that longyth unto the
kynge of North Galys. 'CMMALORY-M4,205.3329

'Well, fayre lady, syn that ye know my name and requyre me of knyghthode
to helpe, I woll do what I may to gete youre hauke; CMMALORY-M4,205.3330

and yet God knowyth I am an evyll clymber, CMMALORY-M4,205.3331

and the tre is passynge hyghe, and fewe bowys to helpe me withall.
'CMMALORY-M4,205.3332

And therewith sir Launcelot alyght CMMALORY-M4,205.3333

and tyed his horse to the same tre, CMMALORY-M4,205.3334

and prayde the lady to onarme hym.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3335

And so whan he was unarmed, he put of all his clothis unto his shurte
and his breche, CMMALORY-M4,205.3336

and with myght and grete force he clambe up to the faucon
CMMALORY-M4,205.3337

and tyed the lunes to a grete rotyn boysh, CMMALORY-M4,205.3338

and threwe the hauke downe with the buysh.  CMMALORY-M4,205.3339

And anone the lady gate the hauke in hir honde; CMMALORY-M4,205.3340

and therewithall com oute sir Phelot oute of the grevys suddeynly, that
was hir husbonde, all armed and with his naked swerde in his honde,
CMMALORY-M4,205.3341

and sayde,'A knyght, sir Launcelot, now I have founde the as I wolde

'A, lady! 'seyde sir Launcelot,'why have ye betrayed me?
'CMMALORY-M4,205.3343

'She hath done,'seyde sir Phelot,'but as I commaunded hir,
CMMALORY-M4,205.3344

and <P_206> therefore there is none othir boote but thyne oure is com

'That were shame unto the,'seyde sir Launcelot,'thou an armed knyght to

'Thou gettyste none other grace,'seyde sir Phelot, CMMALORY-M4,206.3347

'and therefore helpe thyself and thou can. 'CMMALORY-M4,206.3348

'Truly,'seyde sir Launcelot,'that shall be thy shame; CMMALORY-M4,206.3349

but syn thou wolt do none other, take myne harneys with the
CMMALORY-M4,206.3350

and hange my swerde there uppon a bowghe that I may gete hit,
CMMALORY-M4,206.3351

and than do thy beste $to sle me and thou can. 'CMMALORY-M4,206.3352

'Nay,'seyde sir Phelot,'for I know the bettir than {that_I_know_thee}
thou wenyste.  CMMALORY-M4,206.3353

Therefore thou gettyst no wepyn and I may kepe the therefro. '
CMMALORY-M4,206.3354

'Alas,'seyde sir Launcelot,'that ever a knyght sholde dey
wepynles! 'CMMALORY-M4,206.3355

And therewith he wayted above hym and undir hym, CMMALORY-M4,206.3356

and over hym above his hede he sawe a rowgh spyke, a bygge bowghe leveles.
CMMALORY-M4,206.3357

And therewith he brake hit of by the body, CMMALORY-M4,206.3358

and than he com lowar, CMMALORY-M4,206.3359

and awayted how his owne horse stoode, CMMALORY-M4,206.3360

and suddenyly he lepe on the farther syde of his horse froward the knyght.
CMMALORY-M4,206.3361

And than sir Phelot laysshed at hym egerly to have slayne hym,
CMMALORY-M4,206.3362

but sir Launcelot put away the stroke with the rowgh spyke,
CMMALORY-M4,206.3363

and therewith toke hym on the hede, that downe he felle in a sowghe to
the grounde.  CMMALORY-M4,206.3364

So than sir Launcelot toke his swerde oute of his honde
CMMALORY-M4,206.3365

and strake his necke in two pecys.  CMMALORY-M4,206.3366

'Alas! 'than cryed that lady,'why haste thou slayne my husbonde?
'CMMALORY-M4,206.3367

'I am nat causer,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,206.3368

'but with falshede ye wolde have had me slayne with treson,
CMMALORY-M4,206.3369

and now hit is fallyn on you bothe. 'CMMALORY-M4,206.3370

And than she sowned as though she wolde dey.  CMMALORY-M4,206.3371

And therewith sir Launcelot gate all his armoure as well as he myght
CMMALORY-M4,206.3372

and put hit uppon hym for drede of more resseite, CMMALORY-M4,206.3373

for he dredde hym that the knyghtes castell was so nyghe hym;
CMMALORY-M4,206.3374

and as sone as he myght he toke his horse CMMALORY-M4,206.3375

and departed, CMMALORY-M4,206.3376

and thanked God that he had escaped that harde adventure.
CMMALORY-M4,206.3377

So sir Launcelot rode many wylde wayes thorowoute morys and mares,
CMMALORY-M4,206.3378

and as he rode in a valay, he sey a knyght chasyng a lady with <P_207>

And by fortune, as this knyght sholde have slayne thys lady, she cryed
on sir Launcelot CMMALORY-M4,207.3380

and prayde hym to rescowe her.  CMMALORY-M4,207.3381

Whan sir Launcelot sye that myschyff, he toke his horse
CMMALORY-M4,207.3382

and rode betwene hem, sayynge,'Knyght, fye for shame, why wolte thou
sle this lady?  CMMALORY-M4,207.3383

Shame unto the and all knyghtes! 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3384

'What haste thou to do betwyxte me and my wyff?  CMMALORY-M4,207.3385

I woll sle her magre` thyne hede. 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3386

'That shall ye nat,'sayde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,207.3387

'for rather we woll have ado togydyrs. 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3388

'sir Launcelot,'seyde the knyght,'thou doste nat thy parte,
CMMALORY-M4,207.3389

for thys lady hath betrayed me. 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3390

'Hit is not so,'seyde the lady, CMMALORY-M4,207.3391

'truly, he seyth wronge on me.  CMMALORY-M4,207.3392

And for bycause I love $and cherysshe my cousyn jarmayne, he is jolowse
betwyxte me and hym; CMMALORY-M4,207.3393

and as I mutte answere to God there was never sene betwyxte us none
suche thynges.  CMMALORY-M4,207.3394

But, sir,'seyde the lady,'as thou arte called the worshypfullyest knyght
of the worlde, I requyre the of trewe knyghthode, kepe me and save me,
CMMALORY-M4,207.3395

for whatsomever he sey he woll sle me, CMMALORY-M4,207.3396

for he is withoute mercy. 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3397

'Have ye no doute: CMMALORY-M4,207.3398

hit shalle nat lye in his power. 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3399

'sir,'seyde the knyght,'in your syght I woll be ruled as ye woll have

And so sir Launcelot rode on the one syde and she on the other syde.
CMMALORY-M4,207.3401

And he had nat redyn but a whyle but the knyght bade sir Launcelot turne
hym and loke behynde hym, and seyde,'sir, yondir com men of armys aftir
$us rydynge. 'CMMALORY-M4,207.3402

And so sir Launcelot turned hym CMMALORY-M4,207.3403

and thought no treson; CMMALORY-M4,207.3404

and therewith was the knyght and the lady on one syde,
CMMALORY-M4,207.3405

and suddeynly he swapped of the ladyes hede.  CMMALORY-M4,207.3406

And whan sir Launcelot had aspyed hym what he had done, he seyde
and so called hym:'Traytoure, thou haste shamed me for evir!
'CMMALORY-M4,207.3407

And suddeynly sir Launcelot alyght of his horse CMMALORY-M4,207.3408

and pulde oute his swerde to sle hym.  CMMALORY-M4,207.3409

And therewithall he felle to the erthe CMMALORY-M4,207.3410

and gryped sir Launcelot by the thyghes CMMALORY-M4,207.3411

and cryed mercy.  CMMALORY-M4,207.3412

'Fye on the,'seyde sir Launcelot,'thou shamefull knyght!
CMMALORY-M4,207.3413

Thou mayste have no mercy: CMMALORY-M4,207.3414

therefore aryse CMMALORY-M4,207.3415

<P_208>

'Nay,'sayde the knyght,'I woll never aryse tyll ye graunte me

'Now woll I proffyr the fayre: CMMALORY-M4,208.3419

'Nay, sir, that woll I never. 'CMMALORY-M4,208.3423

'Well,'seyde sir Launcelot,'take this lady and the hede,
CMMALORY-M4,208.3424

and here shalt thou swere uppon my swerde to bere hit allwayes uppon

'CMMALORY-M4,208.3426

'sir, that woll I do, by the feyth of my $body. ' CMMALORY-M4,208.3427

'Now what is youre name? 'CMMALORY-M4,208.3428

'sir, my name is sir $Pedyvere. 'CMMALORY-M4,208.3429

'In a shamefull oure were thou borne,'seyde sir Launcelot.
CMMALORY-M4,208.3430

So sir Pedyvere departed with the lady dede and the hede togydir,
CMMALORY-M4,208.3431

and founde the quene with kynge Arthure at Wynchestir;
CMMALORY-M4,208.3432

and there he tolde all the trouthe.  CMMALORY-M4,208.3433

'sir knyght,'seyde the quene,'this is an horryble dede and a shamefull,
and a grete rebuke unto sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,208.3434

but natwythstondyng his worshyp is knowyn in many dyverse contreis.
CMMALORY-M4,208.3435

But this shall I gyff you in penaunce: CMMALORY-M4,208.3436

And ye shall nevir reste one nyght $there $as {TEXT:thereas} ye do

and ye go to ony bedde the dede body shall lye with you. '
CMMALORY-M4,208.3440

This oth he there made CMMALORY-M4,208.3441

And as hit tellyth in the Frenshe booke, whan he com unto Rome the Pope
there bade hym go agayne unto quene Gwenyver, CMMALORY-M4,208.3443

and in Rome was his lady buryed by the Popys commaundement.
CMMALORY-M4,208.3444

And after thys knyght sir Pedyvere fell to grete goodnesse

<P_209>

and ever now and now com all the knyghtes home that were presoners with

Anone therewith com three knyghtes that fought with sir Launce-lot at

'But I shall ease your hertes,'seyde sir Kay,'CMMALORY-M4,209.3464

The Departure CMMALORY-M4,626.3480

<$$heading>

AT the vigyl of Pentecoste, when all the felyship of the Table Rownde
were com unto Camelot and there harde hir servyse, so at the laste the
tablys were sette redy to the meete, ryght so entird into the halle
a full fayre jantillwoman on horsebacke that had ryddyn full faste,
for hir horse was all beswette.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3482

Than she there alyght CMMALORY-M4,626.3483

and com before the kynge CMMALORY-M4,626.3484

and salewed hym, CMMALORY-M4,626.3485

and he seyde,'Damesell, God you blysse! 'CMMALORY-M4,626.3486

'Sir,'seyde she,'for Goddis sake telle me where ys sir Launcelot.
'CMMALORY-M4,626.3487

'He ys yondir, CMMALORY-M4,626.3488

ye may se hym,'seyd the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3489

Than she wente unto sir Launcelot CMMALORY-M4,626.3490

and seyde,'Sir Launcelot, I salew you on kynge Pelles behalff,
CMMALORY-M4,626.3491

and I also requyre you to com with me hereby into a foreste. '
CMMALORY-M4,626.3492

Than sir Launcelot asked her with whom she dwelled.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3493

'I dwelle,'she seyde,'with kynge Pelles. 'CMMALORY-M4,626.3494

'What woll ye with me? 'seyde sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3495

'Ye shall know,'she seyde,'when ye com thydir. ' CMMALORY-M4,626.3496

'Well,'seyde he,'I woll gladly go with you. ' CMMALORY-M4,626.3497

So sir Launcelot bade hys squyre sadyll hys horse and brynge hys armys
in haste.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3498

So he ded hys commandemente.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3499

Than come the quene unto sir Launcelot CMMALORY-M4,626.3500

and seyde,'Woll ye leve us now alone at thys hyghe feste? '
CMMALORY-M4,626.3501

'Madam,'seyde the jantyllwoman,'wyte you well he shall be with you
to-morne by dyner tyme. 'CMMALORY-M4,626.3502

'If I wyste,'seyde the quene,'that he sholde nat be here with us to-morne,
he sholde nat go with you be my good wyll! ' CMMALORY-M4,626.3503

Ryght so departed sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,626.3504

and rode untyll that he com into a foreste and into a grete valey where
they sye an abbey of nunnys.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3505

And there was a squyre redy, CMMALORY-M4,626.3506

and opened the gatis, CMMALORY-M4,626.3507

and so they entird CMMALORY-M4,626.3508

and descended of their horsys.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3509

And anone there cam a fayre felyship aboute sir Launcelot
CMMALORY-M4,626.3510

and wellcomed hym, CMMALORY-M4,626.3511

<em> and were passyng gladde of his comynge <$$em>; CMMALORY-M4,626.3512

and than they ladde hym unto the abbas chambir CMMALORY-M4,626.3513

and unarmed hym.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3514

And ryght so he was ware uppon a bed lyynge two of hys cosyns, sir Bors
and sir Lyonell.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3515

And anone he waked them, CMMALORY-M4,626.3516

and whan they syghe hym they made grete joy.  CMMALORY-M4,626.3517

<P_627>

'Sir,'seyde sir Bors unto sir Launcelot,'what adventure hath brought
you hidir?  CMMALORY-M4,627.3519

For we wende to have founde you to-morne at Camelot. '
CMMALORY-M4,627.3520

'So God me helpe,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,627.3521

'a jantillwoman brought me hydir, CMMALORY-M4,627.3522

but I know nat the cause. 'CMMALORY-M4,627.3523

So in the meanewhyle that they thus talked togydir, there com in twelve
nunnes that brought with hem Galahad, the whych was passynge fayre and
welle made, that unneth in the worlde men myght nat fynde hys macche.
CMMALORY-M4,627.3524

And all tho ladyes wepte.  CMMALORY-M4,627.3525

'Sir,'seyd they all,'we brynge you hyre thys chylde the whycch we have
norysshed, CMMALORY-M4,627.3526

and we pray you to make hym knyght, CMMALORY-M4,627.3527

for of a more worthyer mannes honde may he nat resceyve the Order of
Knyghthode. 'CMMALORY-M4,627.3528

Sir Launcelot behylde thys yonge squyer CMMALORY-M4,627.3529

and saw hym semely and demure as a dove, with all maner of goode fetures ,
that he wende of hys ayge never to have scene so fayre a fourme of a man.
CMMALORY-M4,627.3530

Than seyde sir Launcelot,'Commyth thys desyre of hymselff? '
CMMALORY-M4,627.3531

He and all they seyde'yes. 'CMMALORY-M4,627.3532

'Than shall he,'seyde sir Launcelot,'resseyve the Order of Knyghthode
at the reverence of the hyghe feste. 'CMMALORY-M4,627.3533

So that nyght sir Launcelot had passyng good chere.  CMMALORY-M4,627.3534

And on the $morne at the howre of pryme at Galahaddis desyre he made
hym knyght, CMMALORY-M4,627.3535

and seyde,'God make you a good man, CMMALORY-M4,627.3536

for of beaute` faylith you none as ony that ys now lyvynge.
CMMALORY-M4,627.3537

Now, fayre sir,'seyde sir Launcelot,'woll ye com with me unto the courte
of kynge Arthure? 'CMMALORY-M4,627.3538

'Nay,'seyde he,'I woll nat go with you at thys tyme. '
CMMALORY-M4,627.3539

Than he departed frome them CMMALORY-M4,627.3540

and toke hys two cosynes with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,627.3541

And so they com unto Camelot by the owre of undirne on Whytsonday.
CMMALORY-M4,627.3542

So by that tyme the kynge and the quene was gone to the mynster to here
their servyse.  CMMALORY-M4,627.3543

Than the kynge and the quene were passynge glad of sir Bors and sir
Lyonel, CMMALORY-M4,627.3544

and so was all the felyshyp.  CMMALORY-M4,627.3545

So whan the kynge and all the knyghtes were com frome servyse the
barownes aspyed in the segys of the Rounde Table all aboute wretyn with
golde lettirs: <P_628>'HERE OUGHT TO SITTE HE', and'HE OUGHT TO SITTE
HYRE. 'CMMALORY-M4,628.3546

And thus they wente so longe tylle that they com to the Sege Perelous
, where they founde lettirs newly wrytten of golde, whych seyde:
'FOUR HONDRED WYNTIR AND FOUR AND FYFFTY ACOMPLYVYSSHED AFTIR THE
PASSION OF OURE LORDE JESU CRYST OUGHTE THYS SYEGE TO BE FULFYLLED.
'CMMALORY-M4,628.3547

Than all they seyde,'Thys ys a mervylous thynge and an adventures!
'CMMALORY-M4,628.3548

'In the name of God! 'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,628.3549

and than accounted the terme of the wrytynge, frome the byrth of oure
Lorde untyll that day.  CMMALORY-M4,628.3550

'Hit semyth me,'seyd sir Launcelot,'that thys syge oughte to be fulfylled
thys same day, CMMALORY-M4,628.3551

for thys $ys the Pentecoste after the four hondred and four and fyffty
yere.  CMMALORY-M4,628.3552

And if hit wolde please all partyes, I wolde none of thes lettirs were
sene thys day tyll that he be com that ought to enchyve thys adventure.
'CMMALORY-M4,628.3553

Than made they to ordayne a cloth of sylke for to cover thes lettirs in
the Syege Perelous.  CMMALORY-M4,628.3554

Than the kynge bade haste unto dyner.  CMMALORY-M4,628.3555

'Sir,'seyde sir Kay the Stywarde,'if ye go now unto youre mete ye shall
breke youre olde custom of youre courte, CMMALORY-M4,628.3556

for ye have nat used on thys day to sytte at your mete or that ye have
sene some adventure. 'CMMALORY-M4,628.3557

'Ye sey sothe,'seyde the kynge, CMMALORY-M4,628.3558

'but I had so grete joy of sir Launcelot and of hys cosynes whych bene
com to the courte hole and sounde, that I bethought me nat of none olde
custom. 'CMMALORY-M4,628.3559

So as they stood spekynge, in com a squyre that seyde unto the kynge,
'Sir, I brynge unto you mervaylous tydynges. 'CMMALORY-M4,628.3560

'What be they? 'seyde the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,628.3561

'Sir, there ys here bynethe at the ryver a grete stone whych I saw fleete
abovyn the watir, CMMALORY-M4,628.3562

and therein I saw stykynge a swerde. 'CMMALORY-M4,628.3563

Than the kynge seyde,'I woll se that mervayle. 'CMMALORY-M4,628.3564

So all the knyghtes wente with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,628.3565

And when they cam unto $the ryver they founde there a stone fletynge,
as hit were of rede marbyll, CMMALORY-M4,628.3566

and therein stake a fayre ryche swerde, CMMALORY-M4,628.3567

and the pomell <P_629> thereof was of precious stonys wrought with
lettirs of golde subtyle`.  CMMALORY-M4,629.3568

Than the barownes redde the lettirs whych seyde in thys wyse:'NEVER
SHALL MAN TAKE ME HENSE BUT ONLY HE BY WHOS SYDE I OUGHT TO HONGE
CMMALORY-M4,629.3569

AND HE SHALL BE THE BESTE KNYGHT OF THE WORLDE. 'CMMALORY-M4,629.3570

So whan the kynge had sene the lettirs he seyde unto sir Launcelot,
'Fayre sir, thys swerde ought to be youres, CMMALORY-M4,629.3571

for I am sure ye be the beste knyght of the worlde. ' CMMALORY-M4,629.3572

Than sir Launcelot answerde full sobirly,'Sir, that ys nat my swerde ;
CMMALORY-M4,629.3573

also, I have no hardines to sette my honde thereto, CMMALORY-M4,629.3574

for hit longith nat to hange be my syde.  CMMALORY-M4,629.3575

Also, who that assayth to take hit and faylith of that swerde, he shall
resseyve a wounde by that swerde that he shall nat be longe hole afftir.
CMMALORY-M4,629.3576

And I woll nat ye weyte that thys same day shall the adventure
of the Sankgreall begynne, that ys called the holy vessell. '
CMMALORY-M4,629.3577

'Now, fayre nevew,'seyde the kynge unto sir Gawayne,'assay ye for my
love. 'CMMALORY-M4,629.3578

'Sir,'he seyde,'sauff youre good grace, I shall nat do that.
'CMMALORY-M4,629.3579

'Sir,'seyde the kynge,'assay to take the swerde for my love and at my
commaundemente. 'CMMALORY-M4,629.3580

'Sir, youre commaundemente I woll obey. 'CMMALORY-M4,629.3581

And therewith he toke the swerde by the handyle, CMMALORY-M4,629.3582

but he myght nat stirre hit.  CMMALORY-M4,629.3583

'I thanke you,'seyde the kynge.  CMMALORY-M4,629.3584

'My lorde sir Gawayne,'seyde sir Launcelot,'now wete you well thys
swerde shall touche you so sore that ye wolde nat ye had sette youre
honde thereto for the beste castell of thys realme. 'CMMALORY-M4,629.3585

'Sir,'he seyde,'I myght nat withsey myne unclis wyll. '
CMMALORY-M4,629.3586

But whan the kynge herde thys he repented hit much CMMALORY-M4,629.3587

and seyde unto sir Percyvall,'Sir, woll ye assay for my love?
'CMMALORY-M4,629.3588

And he assayed gladly for to beare sir Gawayne felyship,
CMMALORY-M4,629.3589

and therewith he sette to hys honde on the swerde CMMALORY-M4,629.3590

and drew at hit strongely, CMMALORY-M4,629.3591

but he myght nat meve hytte.  CMMALORY-M4,629.3592

Than were there $no mo that durste be so hardy to sette their hondis
thereto.  CMMALORY-M4,629.3593

<P_630>

'Now may ye go to youre dyner,'seyde sir Kay unto the kynge,
CMMALORY-M4,630.3595

'for a mervalous adventure have ye sene. 'CMMALORY-M4,630.3596

So the kynge and all they wente unto the courte, CMMALORY-M4,630.3597

and every knyght knew hys owne place CMMALORY-M4,630.3598

and sette hym therein.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3599

And yonge men that were good knyghtes served them.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3600

So whan they were served and all syegis fulfylled sauff only the Syege
Perelous, anone there befelle a mervaylous adventure: that all the doorys
and wyndowes of the paleyse shutte by themselff.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3601

Natforthan the halle was nat gretly durked, CMMALORY-M4,630.3602

and therewith they abaysshed bothe one and other.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3603

Than kynge Arthure spake fyrste CMMALORY-M4,630.3604

and seyde,'Be God, fayre felowis and lordis, we have sene this day
mervayles!  CMMALORY-M4,630.3605

But or nyght I suppose we shall se gretter mervayles. '
CMMALORY-M4,630.3606

In the meanewhyle com in a good olde man and an awnciente, clothed all

and there was no knyght knew from whens he com.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3608

And with hym he brought a yonge knyght, CMMALORY-M4,630.3609

And thes wordys he seyde:'CMMALORY-M4,630.3611

Pees be with you, fayre lordys! 'CMMALORY-M4,630.3612

Than the olde man seyde unto kynge Arthure,'Sir, I brynge you here a

The kynge was ryght glad of hys wordys CMMALORY-M4,630.3614

and seyde unto the good man,'Sir, ye be ryght wellcom, and the yonge

Than the olde man made the yonge man to unarme hym.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3616

And he was in a cote of rede sendell, CMMALORY-M4,630.3617

and bare a mantell uppon hys sholder that was furred with ermyne,
CMMALORY-M4,630.3618

and put that uppon hym.  CMMALORY-M4,630.3619

And the olde knyght seyde unto $the yonge knyght,'Sir, swith me.
'CMMALORY-M4,630.3620

And anone he lad hym to the Syege Perelous where besyde sate sir Launcelot

'Sir,'seyde the olde knyght,'weyte you well that place ys youres.

<P_631>

And than he sette hym downe surely in that syge, CMMALORY-M4,631.3626

and than he seyde unto the olde man'Now may ye, sir, go youre way,
CMMALORY-M4,631.3627

for well have ye done in that that ye were commaunded.
CMMALORY-M4,631.3628

And recommaunde me unto my grauntesyre, kynge Pelles, and unto my lorde
kynge Pecchere, CMMALORY-M4,631.3629

and sey hem on my behalff I shall com and se hem as sone as ever y may.
'CMMALORY-M4,631.3630

So the good man departed.  CMMALORY-M4,631.3631

And there mette hym twenty noble squyers, CMMALORY-M4,631.3632

and so toke their horsys CMMALORY-M4,631.3633

and wente their wey.  CMMALORY-M4,631.3634

Than all the knyghtes of the Table Rounde mervayled gretly of sir Galahad
that he durst sitte there and was so tendir of ayge, CMMALORY-M4,631.3635

and wyste nat from whens he com but all only be God.  CMMALORY-M4,631.3636

All they seyde,'Thys ys he by whom the Sankgreall shall be encheved,
CMMALORY-M4,631.3637

for there sate never none but he there but he were myscheved. '
CMMALORY-M4,631.3638

Than sir Launcelot behylde hys sonne CMMALORY-M4,631.3639

and had grete joy of hym.  CMMALORY-M4,631.3640

Than sir Bors tolde hys felowis,'Uppon payne of my lyff thys yonge knyght

So thys noyse was grete in all the courte, that hit cam unto the quene.

And she had mervayle what knyght hit <em> myghte be <$$em> that durste

Than som seyde he resembled much unto sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,631.3644

'I may well suppose,'seyde the quene,'that sir Launcelot begate hym on

I wolde fayne se hym,'seyde the quene, CMMALORY-M4,631.3647

'for he muste nedys be a noble man, CMMALORY-M4,631.3648

for so hys fadir ys that hym begate: CMMALORY-M4,631.3649

I reporte me unto all the Table Rounde. 'CMMALORY-M4,631.3650

So when the mete was done, that the kynge and all were rysen, the kyng

And uppon payne of my lyff he shall encheve the Sankgreall, ryght as

Than cam kynge Arthure unto sir Galahad CMMALORY-M4,631.3657

<P_632>

Than the kynge toke hym by the honde CMMALORY-M4,632.3662

and wente downe frome the paleyes to shew Galahad the adventures of

'Sir,'seyde the kynge unto sir Galahad,'here ys a grete mervayle as ever

And anone he leyde hys honde on the swerde, CMMALORY-M4,632.3673

And that ys the change of youre name and levynge.  CMMALORY-M4,632.3697

Wherefore I make unto you a remembraunce that ye shall nat wene
frome hensforthe that ye be the best knyght of the worlde. '
CMMALORY-M4,632.3698

<P_633>

'As towchyng unto that,'seyde sir Launcelot,'I know well I was never
none of the beste. 'CMMALORY-M4,633.3700

'Yes,'seyde the damesell,'that were ye, CMMALORY-M4,633.3701

and ar yet, of ony synfull man of the worlde.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3702

And, sir kynge, Nacien the eremeyte $sendeth the worde that the shall
befalle the grettyst worship that ever befelle kynge in Bretayne,
CMMALORY-M4,633.3703

and I sey $you wherefore: CMMALORY-M4,633.3704

for thys day the Sankegreall appered in thy house CMMALORY-M4,633.3705

and fedde the and all thy felyship of the Rounde Table. '
CMMALORY-M4,633.3706

So she departed and wente the same way that she cam.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3707

'Now,'seyde the kynge,'I am sure at this quest of the Sankegreall shall
all ye of the Rownde Table departe, CMMALORY-M4,633.3708

and nevyr shall I se you agayne hole togydirs, CMMALORY-M4,633.3709

therefore ones shall I se you togydir in the medow, all hole togydirs!
CMMALORY-M4,633.3710

Therefore I wol se you all hole togydir in the medow of Camelot, to juste
and to turney, that aftir youre dethe men may speke of hit that such
good knyghtes were here, such a day, hole togydirs. 'CMMALORY-M4,633.3711

As unto that counceyle and at the kynges rekeyst they accorded all,
CMMALORY-M4,633.3712

and toke on the harneyse that longed unto joustenynge.
CMMALORY-M4,633.3713

But all thys mevynge of the kynge was for thys entente, for to se Galahad
preved; CMMALORY-M4,633.3714

for the kynge demed he sholde nat lyghtly com agayne unto the courte
aftir thys departynge.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3715

So were they assembled in the medowe, both more and lasse.
CMMALORY-M4,633.3716

Than sir Galahalt by the prayer of the kynge and the quene dud on a
noble jesseraunce uppon hym, CMMALORY-M4,633.3717

and also he dud on hys helme, CMMALORY-M4,633.3718

but shylde wolde he take none for no prayer of the kynge.
CMMALORY-M4,633.3719

So than sir Gawayne and othir knyghtes prayde hym to take a speare.
CMMALORY-M4,633.3720

Ryght so he dud.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3721

So the quene was in a towure with all hir ladyes for to beholde that
turnement.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3722

Than sir Galahad dressed hym in myddys of the medow CMMALORY-M4,633.3723

and began to breke spearys mervaylously, that all men had wondir of hym,
CMMALORY-M4,633.3724

for he there surmownted all othir knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3725

For within a whyle he had defowled many good knyghtes of the Table Rounde
sauff all only tweyne, CMMALORY-M4,633.3726

that was sir Launcelot and sir Persyvale.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3727

Than the kynge at the quenys desyre made hym to alyght and to unlace hys
helme, that the quene myght se hym in the vysayge.  CMMALORY-M4,633.3728

Whan she avysed hym she seyde,'I dare well sey sothely that sir Launcelot
begate hym, CMMALORY-M4,633.3729

for never <P_634> two men resembled more in lyknesse.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3730

Therefore hit ys no mervayle thoughe he be of grete proues. '
CMMALORY-M4,634.3731

So a lady that stood by the quene seyde,'Madam, for Goddis sake, ought
he of ryght to be so good a knyght? 'CMMALORY-M4,634.3732

'Ye, forsothe,'seyde the quene, CMMALORY-M4,634.3733

'for he ys of all partyes comyn of the beste knyghtes of the worlde and
of the hyghest lynage: CMMALORY-M4,634.3734

for sir Launcelot ys com but of the eyghth degre` from oure Lorde Jesu
Cryst, CMMALORY-M4,634.3735

and thys sir Galahad ys $the nyneth degre` frome oure Lorde Jesu Cryst.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3736

Therefore I dare sey they be the grettist jantillmen of the worlde.
'CMMALORY-M4,634.3737

And than the kynge and all the astatis wente home unto Camelot,
CMMALORY-M4,634.3738

and so wente unto evynsong to the grete monester.  And so aftir uppon
that to sowper, CMMALORY-M4,634.3739

and every knyght sette in hys owne place as they were toforehonde.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3740

Than anone they harde crakynge and cryynge of thundir, that hem thought
the palyse sholde all to-dryve.  CMMALORY-M4,634.3741

So in the myddys of the blast entyrde a sonnebeame, more clerer by seven
tymys than ever they saw day, CMMALORY-M4,634.3742

and all they were alyghted of the grace of the Holy Goste.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3743

Than began every knyght to beholde other, CMMALORY-M4,634.3744

and eyther saw other, by their semynge, fayrer than ever they were before.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3745

Natforthan there was no knyght that myght speke one worde a grete whyle
, CMMALORY-M4,634.3746

and so they loked every man on other as they had bene doome.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3747

Than entird into the halle the Holy Grayle coverde with whyght samyte,
CMMALORY-M4,634.3748

but there was none that myght se hit nother whom that bare hit.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3749

And there was all the halle fulfylled with good odoures,
CMMALORY-M4,634.3750

and every knyght had such metis and drynkes as he beste loves in thys
worlde.  CMMALORY-M4,634.3751

And when the Holy Grayle had bene borne thorow the hall, than the
holy vessell departed suddeynly, that they wyst nat where hit becam.
CMMALORY-M4,634.3752

Than had they all breth to speke, CMMALORY-M4,634.3753

and than the kyng yelded thankynges to God of Hys good grace that He
had sente them.  CMMALORY-M4,634.3754

'Sertes,'$seyde the kynge,'we ought to thanke oure Lorde Jesu Cryste
gretly that he hath shewed us thys day at the reverence of thys hyghe
feste of Pentecost. 'CMMALORY-M4,634.3755

'Now,'seyde sir Gawayne,'we have bene servyd thys day of what metys and
drynkes we thought on.  CMMALORY-M4,634.3756

But one thyng begyled us, that we myght nat se the Holy Grayle:
CMMALORY-M4,634.3757

hit was so preciously coverde.  <P_635> Wherefore I woll make here a vow
that to-morne, withoute longer abydynge, I shall laboure in the queste
of the Sankgreall, and that I shall holde me oute a twelve-month and a
day or more if nede be, CMMALORY-M4,635.3758

and never shall I returne unto the courte agayne tylle I have sene hit
more opynly than hit hath bene shewed here.  CMMALORY-M4,635.3759

And iff I may nat spede I shall returne agayne as he that may nat be
ayenst the wylle of God.  CMMALORY-M4,635.3760

So when they of the Table Rounde harde sir Gawayne sey so, they arose
up the moste party CMMALORY-M4,635.3761

and made such avowes as sir Gawayne hathe made.  CMMALORY-M4,635.3762

Anone as kynge Arthur harde thys he was gretly dysplesed,
CMMALORY-M4,635.3763

for he wyst well he myght nat agaynesey their avowys.
CMMALORY-M4,635.3764

'Alas! 'seyde kynge Arthure unto sir Gawayne,'ye have nygh slayne me
for the avow that ye have made, CMMALORY-M4,635.3765

for thorow you ye have berauffte me the fayryst and the trewyst of
knyghthode that ever was sene togydir in ony realme of the worlde.
CMMALORY-M4,635.3766

For when they departe frome hense I am sure they all shall never mete
more togydir in thys worlde, CMMALORY-M4,635.3767

for they shall dye many in the queste.  CMMALORY-M4,635.3768

And so hit forthynkith nat me a litill, CMMALORY-M4,635.3769

for I have loved them as well as my lyff.  Wherefore hit shall greve me
ryght sore, the departicion of thys felyship, CMMALORY-M4,635.3770

for I have had an olde custom to have hem in my felyship. '
CMMALORY-M4,635.3771

And therewith the teerys felle in hys yen, CMMALORY-M4,635.3772

and than he seyde,'Sir Gawayne, $Gawayne!  Ye have sette me in grete
sorow, CMMALORY-M4,635.3773

for I have grete doute that my trew felyshyp shall never mete here more
agayne. 'CMMALORY-M4,635.3774

'A, sir,'seyde sir Launcelot,'comforte youreself!  CMMALORY-M4,635.3775

For hit shall be unto us a grete honoure, and much more than we dyed in
other placis, CMMALORY-M4,635.3776

for of dethe we be syker. 'CMMALORY-M4,635.3777

'A, Launcelot! 'seyde the kynge,'the grete love that I have had unto
you all the dayes of my lyff makith me to sey such dolefull wordis!
CMMALORY-M4,635.3778

For there was never Crysten kynge that ever had so many worthy men at hys
table as I have had thys day at the Table Rounde.  CMMALORY-M4,635.3779

And that ys my grete sorow.  CMMALORY-M4,635.3780

'Whan the quene, ladyes, and jantillwomen knew of thys tydyng
they had such sorow and hevynes that there myght no tunge telle,
CMMALORY-M4,635.3781

for tho knyghtes had holde them in honoure and charite`.
CMMALORY-M4,635.3782

But aboven all othir quene Gwenyver made grete sorow.
CMMALORY-M4,635.3783

<P_636>

'I mervayle', seyde she,'that my lorde woll suffir hem to departe fro
hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,636.3785

Thus was all the courte trowbled for the love of the departynge of these
knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,636.3786

and many of tho ladyes that loved knyghtes wolde have gone with hir lovis.
CMMALORY-M4,636.3787

And so had they done, had nat an olde knyght com amonge them in relygious
clothynge and spake all on hyght and seyde,'Fayre lordis whych have
sworne in the queste of the Sankgreall, thus sendith you Nacien the
eremyte worde that none in thys queste lede lady nother jantillwoman
with hym, CMMALORY-M4,636.3788

for hit ys nat to do in so hyghe a servyse as they laboure in.
CMMALORY-M4,636.3789

For I warne you playne, he that ys nat clene of hys synnes he shall nat
se the mysteryes of oure Lorde Jesu Cryste'.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3790

And for thys cause they leffte thes ladyes and jantillwomen.
CMMALORY-M4,636.3791

So aftir thys the quene come unto sir Galahad CMMALORY-M4,636.3792

and asked hym of whens he was and of what contrey.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3793

Than he tolde hir of whens he was.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3794

'And sonne unto sir Launcelot? '<em> she seyde <$$em>.
CMMALORY-M4,636.3795

As to that $he seyde nother yee nother nay.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3796

'So God me helpe,'seyde the quene,'CMMALORY-M4,636.3797

ye $darf nat shame, CMMALORY-M4,636.3798

for he ys the goodlyest knyght, and of the beste men of the worlde commyn
, and of the strene, of all partyes, of kynges.  Wherefore you ought of
ryght to be of youre dedys a passyng good man.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3799

And sertayne', she seyde,'ye resemble hym much. ' CMMALORY-M4,636.3800

Than sir Galahad was a lityll ashamed CMMALORY-M4,636.3801

and seyde,'Madame, sithyn ye know in sertayne, wherefore do ye aske
hit me?  CMMALORY-M4,636.3802

For he that ys my fadir shall be knowyn opynly and all betymys.
'CMMALORY-M4,636.3803

And than they wente unto reste them.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3804

And in honoure of the hyghnes of knyghthod $of sir Galahad he was ledde
into kynge Arthures chambir, CMMALORY-M4,636.3805

and there rested in hys owne bedde.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3806

And as sone as hit was day the kynge arose, CMMALORY-M4,636.3807

for he had no reste of all that nyght for sorow.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3808

Than he wente unto sir Gawayne and unto sir Launcelot that were arysen
for to hyre masse, CMMALORY-M4,636.3809

and than the kynge agayne seyde,'A, Gawayne, Gawayne!  Ye have betrayed
me, CMMALORY-M4,636.3810

for never shall my courte be amended by you.  CMMALORY-M4,636.3811

But ye woll never be so sory for me as I am for you! '
CMMALORY-M4,636.3812

<P_637>

And therewith the tearys began to renne downe by hys vysayge,
CMMALORY-M4,637.3814

and therewith the kynge seyde,'A, curteyse knyght, sir Launcelot!
I requyre you that ye counceyle me, CMMALORY-M4,637.3815

for I wolde that thys queste were at an ende and hit myght be.
'CMMALORY-M4,637.3816

'Sir,'seyde sir Launcelot,'ye saw yestirday so many worthy knyghtes
there were sworne that they may nat leve hit in no maner of wyse.
'CMMALORY-M4,637.3817

'That wote I well,'seyde the kynge, CMMALORY-M4,637.3818

'but hit shall so hevy me at their departyng that I wote well there
shall no maner of joy remedy me. 'CMMALORY-M4,637.3819

And than the kynge and the quene wente unto the mynster.
CMMALORY-M4,637.3820

So anone sir Launcelot and sir Gawayne commaunded hir men to brynge hir
armys, CMMALORY-M4,637.3821

and when they all were all armed sauff hir shyldys and her helmys, than
they com to their felyship whych were all redy in the same wyse for to
go to the monastery to hyre their masse and servyse.  CMMALORY-M4,637.3822

Than aftir servyse the kynge wolde wete how many had undirtake the queste
of the Holy Grayle; CMMALORY-M4,637.3823

than founde they be tale an hondred and fyffty, CMMALORY-M4,637.3824

and all tho were knyghtes of the Rounde Table.  CMMALORY-M4,637.3825

And than they put on their helmys CMMALORY-M4,637.3826

and departed CMMALORY-M4,637.3827

and recommaunded them all hole unto the kynge and quene.
CMMALORY-M4,637.3828

And there was wepyng and grete sorow.  CMMALORY-M4,637.3829

Than the quene departed into the chambir CMMALORY-M4,637.3830

and horde hir there, that no man shold perceyve hir grete sorowys.
CMMALORY-M4,637.3831

Whan sir Launcelot myssed the quene he wente tyll hir chambir,
CMMALORY-M4,637.3832

and when she saw hym she cryed alowde CMMALORY-M4,637.3833

and seyde,'A, sir Launcelot, Launcelot!  Ye have betrayde me and putte
me to the deth, for to leve thus my lorde! 'CMMALORY-M4,637.3834

'A, madam, I pray you be nat displeased, CMMALORY-M4,637.3835

for I shall com agayne as sone as I may with my worship. '
CMMALORY-M4,637.3836

'Alas,'seyde she,'that ever I syghe you!  CMMALORY-M4,637.3837

But He that suffird dethe uppon the Crosse for all menkynde, He
be unto you good conduyte and saufte`, and all the hole felyshyp!
'CMMALORY-M4,637.3838

Ryght so departed sir Launcelot CMMALORY-M4,637.3839

and founde hys felyship that abode hys commyng, CMMALORY-M4,637.3840

and than they toke their horsys CMMALORY-M4,637.3841

and rode thorow the strete of Camelot.  CMMALORY-M4,637.3842

And there was wepyng of ryche <P_638> and poore, CMMALORY-M4,638.3843

and the kynge turned away CMMALORY-M4,638.3844

and myght nat speke for wepyng.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3845

So within a whyle they rode all togydirs tyll that they com to a cite`
, and a castell that hyght Vagon.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3846

And so they entird into the castell, CMMALORY-M4,638.3847

and the lorde thereof was an olde man that hyght Vagon, and good of hys

and sette opyn the gatis CMMALORY-M4,638.3849

and made hem all the chere that he myght.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3850

And so on the morne they were all accorded that they sholde departe

And on the morne they departed with wepyng chere, CMMALORY-M4,638.3852

<$$heading>

Now rydith Galahad yet withouten shylde, CMMALORY-M4,638.3857

and so rode four dayes withoute ony adventure, CMMALORY-M4,638.3858

and at the fourthe day aftir evynsonge he com to a whyght abbay.
CMMALORY-M4,638.3859

And there was he resceyved with grete reverence and lad untyll a chambir
, CMMALORY-M4,638.3860

and there was he unarmed.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3861

And than was he ware of two knyghtes of the Table Rounde,
CMMALORY-M4,638.3862

$one was sir Bagdemagus, and sir Uwayne, CMMALORY-M4,638.3863

and when they sy hym they $went to sir Galahad CMMALORY-M4,638.3864

and made of hym grete solace.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3865

And so they wente unto supper.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3866

'Sirs,'seyde sir Galahad,'what adventure brought you hydir?
'CMMALORY-M4,638.3867

'Sir,'they seyde,'hit ys tolde us that in thys place ys a shylde that no
man may bere hit aboute his necke but he be myscheved other dede within
three dayes, other maymed for ever.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3868

But, sir,'seyde kynge Bagdemagus,'I shall beare hit to-morne for to
assay thys adventure. 'CMMALORY-M4,638.3869

'In the name of God! 'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3870

'Sir,'seyde Bagdemagus,'and I may nat encheve the adventure of thys
shylde ye shall take hit uppon you, CMMALORY-M4,638.3871

for I $am sure ye shall nat fayle. 'CMMALORY-M4,638.3872

'Sir, I ryght well agre` me thereto, CMMALORY-M4,638.3873

for I have no shylde. 'CMMALORY-M4,638.3874

So on the morne they arose CMMALORY-M4,638.3875

and herde masse.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3876

Than syr Bagdemagus asked where the adventures shylde was.
CMMALORY-M4,638.3877

Anone a munke ledde hym behynde an awter where the shylde hynge as whyght

but in the myddys was a rede crosse.  CMMALORY-M4,638.3879

<P_639>

'Syrres,'seyde $the monke,'thys shylde oughte nat to be honged aboute
the nek of no knyght but he be the worthyest knyght of the worlde.
CMMALORY-M4,639.3881

Therefore I counceyle you, knyghtes, to be well avysed. '
CMMALORY-M4,639.3882

'Well,'seyde sir Bagdemagus,'I wote well I am nat the beste knyght ,
CMMALORY-M4,639.3883

but I shall assay to bere hit,'CMMALORY-M4,639.3884

and so bare hit oute of the monaster.  CMMALORY-M4,639.3885

Than he seyde unto sir Galahad,'And hit please you to abyde here styll
tylle that ye wete how that I spede. 'CMMALORY-M4,639.3886

'Sir, I shall abyde you,'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,639.3887

Than kynge Bagdemagus toke with hym a good squyre, to brynge tydynges

Than they rode two myle CMMALORY-M4,639.3889

and com to a fayre valey before an ermytayge, CMMALORY-M4,639.3890

and than they saw a knyght com frome that partyes in whyght armour,

and he com as faste as hys horse myght renne, and hys speare in hys

Than sir Bagdemagus dressed hys speare ayenste hym CMMALORY-M4,639.3893

and brake hit uppon the whyght knyght, CMMALORY-M4,639.3894

but the othir stroke hym so harde that he braste the mayles
CMMALORY-M4,639.3895

and threste hym thorow the ryght sholdir, CMMALORY-M4,639.3896

for the shylde coverde hym nat as at that tyme.  CMMALORY-M4,639.3897

And so he bare hym frome hys horse, CMMALORY-M4,639.3898

and therewith he alyght CMMALORY-M4,639.3899

and toke hys whyght shylde from hym, saynge,'Knyght, thou hast done

for thys shylde ought nat to be borne but by hym that shall have no pere

And than he com to Bagdemagus squyre CMMALORY-M4,639.3902

and bade hym'bere thys shylde to the good knyght sir Galahad that thou

and grete hym well by me. 'CMMALORY-M4,639.3904

'Sir,'seyde the squyre,'what ys youre name? ' CMMALORY-M4,639.3905

'Take thou none hede of my name,'seyde the $knyghte,' CMMALORY-M4,639.3906

for hit ys nat for $the to know, nother none erthely man. '
CMMALORY-M4,639.3907

'Now, fayre sir,'seyde the squyre,'at the reverence of Jesu Cryst,
telle me be what cause thys shylde may nat be borne but if the berer
therof be myscheved. 'CMMALORY-M4,639.3908

'Now syn thou hast conjoured me,'seyde the knyght,'thys shelde behovith

Than the squyre wente unto Bagdemagus CMMALORY-M4,639.3910

and asked hym whethir he were sore wounded or none.  CMMALORY-M4,639.3911

'Ye forsoth,'seyde he,'I shall ascape harde frome the deth.
'CMMALORY-M4,639.3912

Than he fette hys horse CMMALORY-M4,639.3913

and ledde hym with a grete payne tylle they cam unto the abbay.
CMMALORY-M4,639.3914

Than he was takyn downe sofftely and <P_640> unarmed and leyde in hys
bedde and loked there $to hys woundys.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3915

And as the booke tellith, he lay there longe CMMALORY-M4,640.3916

and ascaped hard with the lyff.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3917

'Sir Galahad,'seyde the squyre,'that knyght that wounded Bag-demagus
sende you gretyng, CMMALORY-M4,640.3918

and bade that ye sholde bere thys shylde wherethorow grete adventures
sholde befalle. 'CMMALORY-M4,640.3919

'Now blyssed be good fortune! 'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3920

And than he asked hys armys CMMALORY-M4,640.3921

and mownted uppon hys horse backe CMMALORY-M4,640.3922

and hanged the whyght shylde aboute hys necke CMMALORY-M4,640.3923

and com-maunded hem unto God.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3924

So sir Uwayne seyde he wolde beare hym felyshyp if hit pleased hym.
CMMALORY-M4,640.3925

'Sir,'seyde sir Galahad,'that may ye nat, CMMALORY-M4,640.3926

for I must go alone, save thys squyre shall bere me felyship.
'CMMALORY-M4,640.3927

And so departed sir Uwayne.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3928

Than within a whyle cam sir Gala-had $there $as {TEXT:thereas} the whyght
knyght abode hym by the ermytayge, CMMALORY-M4,640.3929

and everych salewed other curteysly.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3930

'Sir,'seyde sir Galahad,'by thys shylde bene many mervayles
fallen. 'CMMALORY-M4,640.3931

'Syr,'seyde the knyght,'hit befelle aftir the Passion of oure Lorde
Jesu Cryste two and thirty yere that Joseph of Aramathy, that jantyll
knyght the whych toke downe our Lorde of the holy Crosse, at that tyme
he departed frome Jerusalem with a grete party of hys kyn-rede with hym.
CMMALORY-M4,640.3932

And so he labourde tyll they com to a cite` whych hyght Sarras.
CMMALORY-M4,640.3933

And that same owre that Joseph com to Sarras, there was a kynge that
hyght Evelake that had grete warre ayenst the Sarezens, and in especiall
ayenste one Sarezyn the whych was kynge Evelakes cousyn, a ryche kynge
and a myghty, whych marched nyghe hys londe, CMMALORY-M4,640.3934

and hys name was called Tholome la Feyntis.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3935

So on a day thes two mette to do batayle.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3936

'Than Joseph, the sonne of Aramathy, wente to kyng Evelake
CMMALORY-M4,640.3937

and tolde hym he sholde be discomfite and slayne but he leffte hys beleve
of the olde law and beleeve uppon the new law.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3938

And anone he shewed hym the ryght beleve of the Holy Trynyte`, for the
whyche he agreed unto with all hys herte.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3939

'And there thys shylde was made for kynge Evelake in the name of Hym
that dyed on the Crosse.  CMMALORY-M4,640.3940

And than thorow hys goodly belyeve he had the bettir of kynge Tholome.
CMMALORY-M4,640.3941

For when kynge <P_641> Eve-lake was in the batayle there was a clothe
sette afore the shylde, CMMALORY-M4,641.3942

and whan he was in the grettist perell he lett put awey the cloth,
CMMALORY-M4,641.3943

and than hys enemyes saw a vigoure of a man on the crosse, where-thorow
they all were discomfite.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3944

'And so hit befelle that a man of kynge Evelakes was $smytten hys honde
off, CMMALORY-M4,641.3945

and bare that honde in hys other honde.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3946

And Joseph called that man unto hym CMMALORY-M4,641.3947

and bade hym with good devocion touche the crosse.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3948

And as sone as that man had towched the crosse with hys honde hit was
as hole as ever hit was tofore.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3949

'Than sone afftir $there felle a grete mervayle, that the crosse of
the shylde at one tyme vanysshed, that no man wyste where hit becam.
CMMALORY-M4,641.3950

And than kynge Evelake was baptyzed, and the moste party of all the
people of that cite`.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3951

'So sone aftir Joseph wolde departe, CMMALORY-M4,641.3952

and kynge Evelake wolde nedys go with hym whethir he wolde or nolde.
CMMALORY-M4,641.3953

And so by fortune they com into thys londe that at that tyme was called
Grete Bretayne, CMMALORY-M4,641.3954

and there they founde a grete felon paynym that put Joseph into preson.
CMMALORY-M4,641.3955

And so by fortune that tydynges com unto a worthy man that hyght Mondrames
, CMMALORY-M4,641.3956

and he assembled all hys people for the grete renowne he had herde
of Joseph.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3957

And so he com into the londe of Grete Bretaygne CMMALORY-M4,641.3958

and disheryted thys fellon paynym, CMMALORY-M4,641.3959

and confounded hym, CMMALORY-M4,641.3960

and therewith delyverde Joseph oute of preson.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3961

And after that all the people withturned to the Crystyn feythe.
CMMALORY-M4,641.3962

'So nat longe afftir Joseph was leyde in hys dedly bedde,
CMMALORY-M4,641.3963

and whan kyng Evelake saw that, he had muche sorow, CMMALORY-M4,641.3964

and seyde,'"For thy love I leffte my contrey, CMMALORY-M4,641.3965

and syth ye sholl departe frome me oute of thys worlde, leve me som
$tokyn that I may thynke on you. "'CMMALORY-M4,641.3966

'Than Joseph seyde,"That woll I do full gladly.  CMMALORY-M4,641.3967

Now brynge me youre shylde that I toke you when ye wente into batayle
ayenst kyng Tholome. "CMMALORY-M4,641.3968

'Than Joseph bledde sore at the nose, that he myght nat by no meane be
staunched, CMMALORY-M4,641.3969

and there, uppon that shylde, he made a crosse of hys owne bloode
CMMALORY-M4,641.3970

and seyd,'"Now may ye se a remembrance that I love you,
CMMALORY-M4,641.3971

for ye shall never se thys shylde but ye shall thynke one me.
CMMALORY-M4,641.3972

And hit shall be allwayes as freysh as hit ys now, CMMALORY-M4,641.3973

and never shall no man beare thys <P_642> shylde aboute hys necke but he
shall repente hit, unto the tyme that Galahad, the good knyght, beare hit.
And laste of my lynayge have hit aboute hys necke, that shall do many
mervaylous dedys. "CMMALORY-M4,642.3974

'"Now,"seyde kyng Evelake,"where shall I put thys shylde, that thys
worthy knyght may have hit? "CMMALORY-M4,642.3975

'"Sir, ye shall leve hit $there $as {TEXT:thereas} Nacien the ermyte

for thydir shall that good knyght com the fiftenth day afftir that he

'And so that day that they sette ys thys tyme that he have hys shylde.
CMMALORY-M4,642.3978

And in the same abbay lyeth Nacien the eremyte. 'CMMALORY-M4,642.3979

And the whyght knyght vanyshed.  CMMALORY-M4,642.3980

Anone as the squyre had herde thes wordis he alyght of hys hakenay
CMMALORY-M4,642.3981

and kneled downe at Gala-hadys feete, CMMALORY-M4,642.3982

and prayde hym that he myght go <em> with hym <$$em> tyll he had made

'If I wolde <em> have ony felyshyp I wolde <$$em> nat refuse you.
'CMMALORY-M4,642.3984

'Than woll ye make me a knyght? 'seyde the squyre.  CMMALORY-M4,642.3985

'And that Order, by the grace of God, shall be well besette in me.
'CMMALORY-M4,642.3986

So sir Galahad graunted hym CMMALORY-M4,642.3987

and turned ayen unto the abbay there they cam fro, CMMALORY-M4,642.3988

and there men made grete joy of sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,642.3989

And anone as he was alyght there was a munke brought hym unto a tombe in
a chircheyarde,'where ys such a noyse that who hyryth hit veryly shall
nyghe be madde other lose hys strengthe.  CMMALORY-M4,642.3990

And, sir, we deme hit ys a fyende. 'CMMALORY-M4,642.3991

'Now lede me thydir,'seyd sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,642.3992

And so they dud, all armed sauff hys helme.  CMMALORY-M4,642.3993

'Now,'seyde the good man,'go to the tombe CMMALORY-M4,642.3994

and lyffte hit up. 'CMMALORY-M4,642.3995

And so he dud, CMMALORY-M4,642.3996

and herde a grete noyse; CMMALORY-M4,642.3997

and pyteuously he seyde, that all men myght hyre,'Sir Galahad, the
servaunte of Jesu Crist, com thou nat nyghe me, CMMALORY-M4,642.3998

for thou shalt make me go agayne there where I have bene so longe.
'CMMALORY-M4,642.3999

But sir Galahad was nothynge aferde, CMMALORY-M4,642.4000

but heve up the stone.  CMMALORY-M4,642.4001

And there com oute a fowle smoke, CMMALORY-M4,642.4002

and aftir that he saw the fowlyst vygoure lepe thereoute that ever he
saw in the lyknes of a man.  CMMALORY-M4,642.4003

And than he blyssed hym CMMALORY-M4,642.4004

and wyst well hit was a fyende.  CMMALORY-M4,642.4005

Than herde he a voyce sey,'Sir Galahad, I se there envyrowne aboute the
so many angels that my power may nat deare the! ' CMMALORY-M4,642.4006

<P_643>

Ryght so sir Galahad saw a body all armed lye in that tombe and besyde
hym a swerde.  CMMALORY-M4,643.4008

'Now, fayre brothir,'seyde sir Galahad,'lette remeve thys body.
CMMALORY-M4,643.4009

For he ys nat worthy to lye within thys chyrcheyarde, CMMALORY-M4,643.4010

for he was a false Crysten man. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4011

And therewithall they departed CMMALORY-M4,643.4012

and wente to the abbay.  CMMALORY-M4,643.4013

And anone as he was unarmed a good man cam CMMALORY-M4,643.4014

and set hym downe by hym CMMALORY-M4,643.4015

and seyd,'Sir, I shall telle you what betokenyth of that ye saw in
the tombe.  CMMALORY-M4,643.4016

Sir, that that coverde the body, hit betokenyth the duras of the
worlde, and the grete synne that oure Lorde founde in the worlde.
CMMALORY-M4,643.4017

For there was suche wrecchydnesse that the fadir loved nat the sonne,
nother the sonne loved nat the fadir.  CMMALORY-M4,643.4018

And that was one of the causys that oure lorde toke fleysh and bloode
of a clene maydyn; CMMALORY-M4,643.4019

for oure synnes were so grete at that tyme that well-nyghe all was
wyckednesse. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4020

'Truly,'seyde sir Galahad,'I beleve you ryght well. ' CMMALORY-M4,643.4021

So sir Galahad rested hym there that nyght, CMMALORY-M4,643.4022

and uppon the morne he made the squyre a knyght CMMALORY-M4,643.4023

and asked hym hys name and of what kynred he was com.
CMMALORY-M4,643.4024

'Sir,'he seyde,'men calle me Melyas de Lyle, CMMALORY-M4,643.4025

and I am the sonne of the kynge of Denmarke. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4026

'Now, fayre sir,'seyde Galahad,'sitthyn that ye be com of kynges
and quenys, now lokith that knyghthode be well sette in you,
CMMALORY-M4,643.4027

for ye ought to be a myrroure unto all chevilry. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4028

'Sir,'seyde sir Melyas,'ye sey soth.  CMMALORY-M4,643.4029

But, sir, sytthyn ye have made me a knyght ye must of ryght graunte me
my first desyre that ys resonable. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4030

'Ye say soth,'seyde sir Galahad, CMMALORY-M4,643.4031

'I graunte hit you. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4032

'Grauntmercy, myne owne lorde,'seyde he,'and that ye woll suffir me to
ryde with you in thys queste of the Sankgreall tyll that som adventure
departe us. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4033

'I graunte you, sir. 'CMMALORY-M4,643.4034

Than men brought sir Melias hys armour and his speare and hys horse.
CMMALORY-M4,643.4035

And so sir Galahad and he rode forth all that wyke or ever they founde
ony adventure.  CMMALORY-M4,643.4036

And than uppon a Munday in the mornynge, as they were departed frome
an abbay, they com to a crosse <P_644> whych departed two wayes,
CMMALORY-M4,644.4037

and in that crosse were letters wretyn that seyd thus:'NOW YE KNYGHTES
ARRAUNTE WHICH GOTH TO SEKE KNYGHTES ADVENTURYS, SE HERE TWO WAYES:
CMMALORY-M4,644.4038

THAT ONE WAY DEFENDITH THE THAT THOU NE GO THAT $WAY, CMMALORY-M4,644.4039

FOR HE SHALL NAT GO OUTE OF THE WAY AGAYNE BUT IF HE BE A GOOD MAN AND
A WORTHY KNYGHT.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4040

AND IF THOU GO ON THE LYFFTE HONDE THOU SHALL NAT THERE LYGHTLY WYNNE
PROUESSE, CMMALORY-M4,644.4041

FOR THOU SHALT IN THYS WAY BE SONE ASSAYDE. 'CMMALORY-M4,644.4042

Sir,'seyde Melyas unto sir Galahad,'if hit lyke you to suffir me to take
the way on the lyffte honde <em> lette me <$$em>, CMMALORY-M4,644.4043

for I shall well preve my strength. 'CMMALORY-M4,644.4044

'Hit were bettir,'seyde sir Galahad,'ye rode nat that way,
CMMALORY-M4,644.4045

for I deme I sholde bettir ascape in that way, better than ye.
'CMMALORY-M4,644.4046

'Nay, my lorde, I pray you lette me have that adventure. '
CMMALORY-M4,644.4047

'Take hit in Goddys name,'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4048

NOW TURNYTH THE TALE UNTO SYR MELYAS DE LYLE.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4049

And than rode sir Melyas into an olde foreyste, CMMALORY-M4,644.4050

and therin he rode two dayes and more.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4051

And than he cam into a fayre medow, CMMALORY-M4,644.4052

and there was a fayre lodge of bowys.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4053

And than he aspyed in that lodge a chayre wherein was a crowne of golde,
ryche and subtyly wrought.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4054

Also there was clothys coverde uppon the erthe, and many delycious metis
sette thereon.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4055

So sir Melyas behylde thys adventure CMMALORY-M4,644.4056

and thought hit mervayl-ous, CMMALORY-M4,644.4057

but he had no hungir.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4058

But of the crowne of golde he toke much kepe, CMMALORY-M4,644.4059

and therewith he stowped downe CMMALORY-M4,644.4060

and toke hit up, CMMALORY-M4,644.4061

and rode hys way with hit.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4062

And anone he saw a knyght com rydyng aftir hym CMMALORY-M4,644.4063

and seyde,'Sett downe that crowne whych ys nat youres,
CMMALORY-M4,644.4064

and therefore defende you! 'CMMALORY-M4,644.4065

Than sir Melyas blyssed hym CMMALORY-M4,644.4066

and seyde,'Fayre Lorde of Hevyn, helpe and save thy new-made knyght!
'CMMALORY-M4,644.4067

And than they lette their horses renne as faste as they myght,
CMMALORY-M4,644.4068

and so they smote togydirs.  CMMALORY-M4,644.4069

But the othir knyght smote sir Melyas thorow hawbirke and thorow
the $lyfft syde, that he felle to the <P_645> erth nyghe dede,
CMMALORY-M4,645.4070

and than he toke hys crowne CMMALORY-M4,645.4071

and yode hys way.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4072

And sir Melyas lay stylle CMMALORY-M4,645.4073

and had no power to styrre hym.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4074

So in the meanewhyle by fortune com sir Galahad CMMALORY-M4,645.4075

and founde hym there in perell of dethe.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4076

And than he seyde,'Sir Melyas, who hath wounded you?  CMMALORY-M4,645.4077

Therefore hit had bene better to have ryddyn the other way. '
CMMALORY-M4,645.4078

And whan sir Melyas herde hym speke,'Sir,'he seyde,'for Goddys love,
let me nat dye in thys foreyst, CMMALORY-M4,645.4079

but brynge me to the abbey here besyde, that I may be confessed and have
my ryghtes. 'CMMALORY-M4,645.4080

'Hit shall be done,'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4081

'But where ys he that hath wounded you? 'CMMALORY-M4,645.4082

So with that sir Galahad herde on amonge the levys cry on hyght, 'Knyght,
kepe the from me! 'CMMALORY-M4,645.4083

'A, sir! 'seyde sir Melyas,'beware, CMMALORY-M4,645.4084

for that $ys he that hath slayne me. 'CMMALORY-M4,645.4085

Sir Galahad answerde CMMALORY-M4,645.4086

and seyde,'Sir knyght, com on your perell! 'CMMALORY-M4,645.4087

Than aythir dressed to other CMMALORY-M4,645.4088

and com as fast as they myght dryve.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4089

And sir Galahad smote hym so that hys speare wente thorow his shuldir,
CMMALORY-M4,645.4090

and smote hym downe of hys horse, CMMALORY-M4,645.4091

and in the fallyng sir Galahaddis speare brake.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4092

So with that com oute another knyght oute of the grene levys
CMMALORY-M4,645.4093

and brake a spere uppon sir Galahad or ever he myght turne hym.
CMMALORY-M4,645.4094

Than sir Galahad drew oute hys swerde CMMALORY-M4,645.4095

and smote the lyffte arme off, that hit felle to the erthe;
CMMALORY-M4,645.4096

and than he fledde CMMALORY-M4,645.4097

and sir Galahad sewed faste aftir hym.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4098

And than he turned agayne unto sir Melyas, CMMALORY-M4,645.4099

and there he alyght and dressed hym softely on hys horse tofore hym,
CMMALORY-M4,645.4100

for the truncheon of hys speare was in hys body.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4101

And sir Galahad sterte up behynde hym CMMALORY-M4,645.4102

and hylde hym in hys armys, CMMALORY-M4,645.4103

and so brought hym to the abbay, CMMALORY-M4,645.4104

and there unarmed hym CMMALORY-M4,645.4105

and brought hym to hys chambir.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4106

And than he asked hys Saveoure, CMMALORY-M4,645.4107

and when he had reseyved Hym he seyde unto sir Galahad,'Syr, latte dethe
com whan hit pleasith Hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,645.4108

And therewith he drew the truncheon of the speare oute of hys body,
CMMALORY-M4,645.4109

and than he sowned.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4110

Than com there an olde monke whych somtyme had bene a knyght,
CMMALORY-M4,645.4111

and behylde sir Melyas.  CMMALORY-M4,645.4112

And anone he ransaked hym, CMMALORY-M4,645.4113

and than he seyde unto sir Galahad, <P_646>'I shall heale hym of
hys play, by the grace of God, within the terme of seven wykes.
'CMMALORY-M4,646.4114

Than was sir Galahad glad CMMALORY-M4,646.4115

and unarmed hym CMMALORY-M4,646.4116

and seyde he wolde abyde there stylle all that nyght.
CMMALORY-M4,646.4117

Thus dwelled he there three dayes, CMMALORY-M4,646.4118

and than he asked sir Melyas how hit stood with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4119

Than he seyde he was turned into helpynge, CMMALORY-M4,646.4120

God be thanked.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4121

'Now woll I departe,'sir Galahad seyde, CMMALORY-M4,646.4122

'for I have much on honde, CMMALORY-M4,646.4123

for many good knyghtes be fulle bysy aboute hit.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4124

And thys knyght and I were in the same quest of the Sankgreal.
'CMMALORY-M4,646.4125

'Sir,'seyde a good man,'for hys synne he was thus wounded.
CMMALORY-M4,646.4126

And I mervayle,'seyde the good man,'how ye durste take uppon you so rych
a thynge as the hyghe Order of Knyghthode ys withoute clene confession.
CMMALORY-M4,646.4127

That was the cause that ye were bittirly wounded, CMMALORY-M4,646.4128

for the way on the ryght hande betokenyd the hygheway of oure Lorde Jesu
Cryst, and the way of a good trew lyver.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4129

And the othir way betokenyth the way of synnars and of myssebelevers.
CMMALORY-M4,646.4130

And when the devyll saw your pryde and youre persumpcion for to take
you to the queste of the Sankgreal, and that made you to be overthrowyn,
CMMALORY-M4,646.4131

for hit may nat be encheved but by vertuous lyvynge.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4132

'Also the wrytyng on the crosse was a $significacyon of hevynly dedys,
and of knyghtly dedys in Goddys workys, and no knyghtes dedys in worldly

and pryde ys hede of every synne: CMMALORY-M4,646.4134

that caused thys knyght to departe frome sir Galahad.
CMMALORY-M4,646.4135

And where thou toke the crowne of golde thou ded syn in covetyse and
in theffte.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4136

All this was no knyghtly dedys.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4137

And so, sir Galahad, the holy knyght which fought with $the $two

So now departed sir Galahad frome thens CMMALORY-M4,646.4141

Than sir Melias seyde,'My lord, syr Galahad, as sone as I may ryde I

'God sende you helthe! 'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,646.4144

And so he toke hys horse CMMALORY-M4,646.4145

and departed CMMALORY-M4,646.4146

and rode many journeyes forewarde and bakwarde, CMMALORY-M4,646.4147

and founde <P_647> therein nobody, CMMALORY-M4,647.4151

for all was desolate.  CMMALORY-M4,647.4152

And there he kneled before the awter CMMALORY-M4,647.4153

and besought God of good counceyle, CMMALORY-M4,647.4154

and so as he prayde he harde a voyce that seyd,'Go thou now, thou

Whan sir Galahad harde thys he thanked God CMMALORY-M4,647.4157

And there he mette with a man of grete ayge, CMMALORY-M4,647.4161

and sir Galahad asked hym the castels name.  CMMALORY-M4,647.4163

'Fayre sir,'seyde he,'hit ys the Castell of Maydyns.  CMMALORY-M4,647.4164

That ys a cursed castell and all they that be conversaunte therein,

for all pite` ys oute thereoff, CMMALORY-M4,647.4166

and all hardynes and myschyff ys therein.  CMMALORY-M4,647.4167

Therefore I counceyle you, sir knyght, to turne agayne. '
CMMALORY-M4,647.4168

'Sir,'sir Galahad seyde,'wete you welle that I shall nat turne

Than loked sir Galahad on hys armys that nothyng fayled hym,

And anone there mette hym seven fayre maydyns the whych seyde unto hym,

'Why shold I nat passe the watir? 'seyde sir Galahad.
CMMALORY-M4,647.4174

So rode he away frome hem CMMALORY-M4,647.4175

and mette with a squyre that seyde,'Knyght, thoo knyghtes in the castell

'CMMALORY-M4,647.4177

'Fayre sir,'seyde sir Galahad,'I com for to destroy the wycked custom

'Sir'and ye woll abyde by that ye shall have inowghe to do.
'CMMALORY-M4,647.4179

'Go ye now,'seyde sir Galahad, CMMALORY-M4,647.4180

'and hast my nedys. 'CMMALORY-M4,647.4181

Than the squyre entird into the castell, CMMALORY-M4,647.4182

and anone aftir there com oute of the castell seven knyghtes,
CMMALORY-M4,647.4183

and all were brethirne.  CMMALORY-M4,647.4184

And whan they saw sir Galahad they cryed,'Knyght, kepe the!

For we assure you nothyng but dethe. 'CMMALORY-M4,647.4186

'Why,'seyd Galahad,'woll ye all have ado with me at onys?
'CMMALORY-M4,647.4187

'Yee,'seyde they,'thereto mayste thou truste! ' CMMALORY-M4,647.4188

Than Galahad put forth hys speare CMMALORY-M4,647.4189

and smote the formyst to the <P_648> erthe, that nerehonde he brake

And therewithall the other six smote hym on hys shylde grete strokes,

Than sir Galahad drew oute hys swerde CMMALORY-M4,648.4192

And sir Galahad chased hem tylle they entird into the castell
CMMALORY-M4,648.4195

and so passed thorow the castell at another gate.  CMMALORY-M4,648.4196

And anone there mette <em> sir Galahalte <$$em> an olde man clothyd in

CMMALORY-M4,648.4200

And all they seyde,'Sir, ye be wellcom, CMMALORY-M4,648.4201

for longe have we abydyn here oure delyveraunce! 'CMMALORY-M4,648.4202

Then com to hym a jantillwoman CMMALORY-M4,648.4203

'What woll ye that I do? 'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,648.4206

'Sir,'seyde the jantillwoman,'that ye sende aftir all the knyghtes hydir

'I woll well,'seyde sir Galahad.  CMMALORY-M4,648.4208

And there she brought hym an horne of ivery boundyn with golde rychely,
CMMALORY-M4,648.4209

and seyde,'Sir, blow thys horne whiche woll be harde two myles

Whan sir Galahad had blowyn the horne he sette hym downe uppon a bedde.
CMMALORY-M4,648.4211

Than com a pryste to Galahad CMMALORY-M4,648.4212

and he was lorde of all this contrey.  CMMALORY-M4,648.4214

And whan they had aspyed the dyukes doughter that was a full fayre
woman, than by there false covyn they made a bate betwyxte hemselff.
CMMALORY-M4,648.4215

And the deuke of hys goodnes wolde have departed them,
CMMALORY-M4,648.4216

and there they slew hym and hys eldyst sonne.  CMMALORY-M4,648.4217

And than they toke the maydyn and the tresoure of the castell,
CMMALORY-M4,648.4218

and so by grete force they helde all the knyghtes of the contrey undir
grete servayge and trewayge.  CMMALORY-M4,648.4219

So on a day the deukes doughter seyde to them, <P_649>'"Ye have done

for by one knyght ye shall all be overcom. "CMMALORY-M4,649.4222

Thus she prophecyed seven yerys agone.  CMMALORY-M4,649.4223

'"Well,"seyde the seven knyghtes,"sytthyn ye sey so, there shall never

'And therefore hit ys called the Maydyns Castell, CMMALORY-M4,649.4225

for they have devoured many maydyns. 'CMMALORY-M4,649.4226

'Now,'seyde sir Galahad,'ys she here for whom thys castell was

'Nay, sir,'seyde the pryste,'she was dede within three nyghtes aftir

'I supposse well,'seyde sir Galahad, CMMALORY-M4,649.4235

and toke hys armoure and hys horse, CMMALORY-M4,649.4236

and commaunded hem unto God.  CMMALORY-M4,649.4237

HERE LEVITH THE TALE OF SIR GALAHAD CMMALORY-M4,649.4238

AND SPEKITH OF SIR GAWAYNE.  CMMALORY-M4,649.4239

Now seyth the tale, aftir sir Gawayne departed he rode many journeys
both towarde and frowarde, CMMALORY-M4,649.4240

and at the laste $he com to the abbey where sir Galahad had the whyght

And there sir Gawayne lerned the way to sewe aftir sir Galahad,
CMMALORY-M4,649.4242

and so he rode to the abbey where Melyas lay syke.  CMMALORY-M4,649.4243

And there sir Melyas tolde sir Gawayne of the mervaylous adventures that

'Certes,'seyde sir Gawayne,'I am nat happy that I toke nat the way that

For and I may mete with hym I woll nat departe from hym lyghtly,
CMMALORY-M4,649.4246

for all mervaylous adventures sir Galahad enchevith. '
CMMALORY-M4,649.4247

'Sir,'seyde one of the munkes,'he woll nat of youre felyship.
'CMMALORY-M4,649.4248

'Why so? 'seyde sir Gawayne.  CMMALORY-M4,649.4249

<P_650>

'Sir,'seyd he,'for ye be wycked and synfull, CMMALORY-M4,650.4251

and he ys full blyssed. 'CMMALORY-M4,650.4252

So ryght as they thus talked there com in rydynge sir Gareth,
CMMALORY-M4,650.4253

and than they made grete joy aythir of other.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4254

And on the morne they harde masse CMMALORY-M4,650.4255

and so departed, CMMALORY-M4,650.4256

and by the way they mett with sir Uwayne le Avowtres.

'Nother yet we,'seyd sir Gawayne.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4259

And so ayther promysed othir of tho three knyghtes nat to de-parte
whyle they were in that queste but if suddayne fortune caused hyt.
CMMALORY-M4,650.4260

So they departed CMMALORY-M4,650.4261

and rode by fortune tyll that they cam by the Castell of Maydyns.
CMMALORY-M4,650.4262

And there the seven brethirn aspyed the three knyghtes
CMMALORY-M4,650.4263

and seyde,'Sytthyn we be flemyd by one knyght from thys castell, we
shall destroy all the knyghtes of kyng Arthurs that we may overcom,
for the love of sir Galahad. 'CMMALORY-M4,650.4264

And therewith the seven knyghtes sette uppon hem three knyghtes.
CMMALORY-M4,650.4265

And by fortune sir Gawayne slew one $of the brethren, CMMALORY-M4,650.4266

and ech one of hys felowys overthrew anothir, CMMALORY-M4,650.4267

and so $slew all the remenaunte.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4268

And than they toke the wey undir the castell, CMMALORY-M4,650.4269

and there they loste the way that sir Galahad rode.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4270

And there everych of hem departed from other.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4271

And sir Gawayne rode tyll he com to an ermytayge, CMMALORY-M4,650.4272

and there he founde the good man seyynge hys evynsonge of oure Lady.
CMMALORY-M4,650.4273

And there sir $Gawayne asked herberow for charite`, CMMALORY-M4,650.4274

and the good man graunted hym gladly.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4275

Than the good man asked hym what he was.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4276

'Sir,'he seyde,'I am a knyght of kynge Arthures that am in the queste
of the Sankgreall, CMMALORY-M4,650.4277

'Sir,'seyde the good man,'I wolde wete how hit stondith betwyxte God

'Sir,'seyd sir Gawayne,'I wyll with a good wyll shew you my lyff if hit

There he tolde the eremyte how a monke of an abbay'called me wycked

'He myght well sey hit,'seyde the eremyte, CMMALORY-M4,650.4282

'for when ye were made first knyght ye sholde have takyn you to knyghtly
dedys and vertuous lyvyng.  CMMALORY-M4,650.4283

And ye have done the contrary, CMMALORY-M4,650.4284

for ye have lyved <P_651> myschevously many wyntirs.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4285

And sir Galahad ys a mayde CMMALORY-M4,651.4286

and synned never, CMMALORY-M4,651.4287

and that ys the cause he shall enchyve where he goth that ye nor
none suche shall never attayne, nother none in youre felyship,
CMMALORY-M4,651.4288

for ye have used the moste untrewyst lyff that ever I herd knyght lyve.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4289

For sertes, had ye nat bene so wycked as ye ar, never had the seven
brethirne be slayne by you and youre two felowys: CMMALORY-M4,651.4290

for sir Galahad hymself alone bete hem all seven the day toforne,
CMMALORY-M4,651.4291

but hys lyvyng ys such that he shall sle no man lyghtly.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4292

'Also I may sey you that the Castell of Maydyns betokenyth the good soulys
that were in preson before the Incarnacion of oure Lorde Jesu Cryste.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4293

And the seven knyghtes betokenyth the seven dedly synnes that regned
that tyme in the worlde.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4294

And I may lyckyn the good knyght Galahad unto the Sonne of the Hyghe
Fadir that lyght within a maydyn and bought all the soules oute of
thralle: CMMALORY-M4,651.4295

so ded sir Galahad delyver all the maydyns oute of the woofull castell.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4296

Now, sir Gawayne,'seyde the good man,'thou muste do penaunce for thy
synne. 'CMMALORY-M4,651.4297

'Sir, what penaunce shall I do? 'CMMALORY-M4,651.4298

'Such as I woll gyff the,'seyde the good man.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4299

'Nay,'seyd sir Gawayne,'I may do no penaunce, CMMALORY-M4,651.4300

for we knyghtes adventures many tymes suffir grete woo and payne.
'CMMALORY-M4,651.4301

'Well,'seyde the good man, CMMALORY-M4,651.4302

and than he hylde hys pece.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4303

And on the morne than sir Gawayne departed frome the ermyte
CMMALORY-M4,651.4304

and bytaught hym unto God.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4305

And by adventure he mette wyth sir Agglovale and sir Gryfflet, two
knyghtes of the Rounde Table, CMMALORY-M4,651.4306

and so they three rode four dayes withoute fyndynge of ony adventure.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4307

And at the fifth day they departed CMMALORY-M4,651.4308

and everych hylde as felle them by adventure.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4309

HERE LEVITH THE TALE OF SYR GAWAYNE AND HYS FELOWYS CMMALORY-M4,651.4310

AND SPEKITH OF SIR GALAHAD.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4311

So whan sir Galahad was departed frome the Castell of Maydyns he rode
tyll he com to a waste forest, CMMALORY-M4,651.4312

and there he mette with sir Launcelot and sir Percivale.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4313

But they knew hym nat, CMMALORY-M4,651.4314

for he was new dysgysed.  CMMALORY-M4,651.4315

Ryght so hys fadir, sir Launcelot, dressed hys speare CMMALORY-M4,651.4316

and brake hit uppon sir Galahad, CMMALORY-M4,651.4317

and sir Galahad smote hym so agayne that he bare downe horse and man.
CMMALORY-M4,651.4318

And than he drew his swerde CMMALORY-M4,651.4319

<P_652>

and dressed hym unto sir Percyvall CMMALORY-M4,652.4321

and smote hym so on the helme that hit rooff to the coyff of steele,
CMMALORY-M4,652.4322

and had nat the swerde swarved sir Percyvale had be slayne.
CMMALORY-M4,652.4323

And with the stroke he felle oute of hys sadyll.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4324

So thys justis was done tofore the ermytayge where a recluse dwelled.
CMMALORY-M4,652.4325

And whan she saw sir Galahad ryde she seyde,'God be with the, beste
knyght of the worlde!  CMMALORY-M4,652.4326

A, sertes,'seyde she all alowde, that sir $Launcelot and Percyvall myght

Whan sir Galahad herde hir sey so he was adrad to be knowyn,
CMMALORY-M4,652.4328

and therewith he smote hys horse with his sporys CMMALORY-M4,652.4329

and rode a grete pace toward them.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4330

Than perceyved they bothe that he was sir Galahad, CMMALORY-M4,652.4331

and up they gate on their horsys CMMALORY-M4,652.4332

and rode faste aftir hym.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4333

But within a whyle he was oute of hir syght, CMMALORY-M4,652.4334

and than they turned agayne wyth hevy chere CMMALORY-M4,652.4335

and seyde,'Lat us spyrre som tydynges,'seyde Percyvale,'at yondir
rekles. 'CMMALORY-M4,652.4336

'Do as ye lyst,'seyde sir Launcelot.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4337

So whan sir Percyvale com to the recluse she knew hym well ynoughe and
sir Launcelot both.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4338

But syr Launcelot rode overthwarte and endelonge a wylde foreyst
CMMALORY-M4,652.4339

and hylde no patthe but as wylde adventure lad hym.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4340

And at the last he com to a stony crosse whych departed two wayes in
waste londe, CMMALORY-M4,652.4341

and by the crosse was a stone that was a marble, CMMALORY-M4,652.4342

but hit was so durke that sir Launcelot myght nat wete what hyt was.
CMMALORY-M4,652.4343

Than sir Launcelot loked bysyde hym CMMALORY-M4,652.4344

and saw an olde chapell, CMMALORY-M4,652.4345

and there he wente to have founde people.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4346

And anone sir Launcelot fastenyd hys horse tylle a tre,
CMMALORY-M4,652.4347

and there he dud of hys shylde CMMALORY-M4,652.4348

and than he wente to the chapell dore CMMALORY-M4,652.4350

and founde hit waste and brokyn.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4351

And within he founde a fayre awter full rychely arayde with clothe of

but he coude fynde no place where he myght entir.  CMMALORY-M4,652.4356

Than was he passyng hevy and dysmayed, CMMALORY-M4,652.4357

and returned ayen CMMALORY-M4,652.4358

and layde hym downe to slepe uppon hys shylde tofore the crosse.
CMMALORY-M4,653.4364

And so he felle on slepe; CMMALORY-M4,653.4365

and half wakyng and half slepynge he saw commyng by hym two palfreyes, all
fayre and whyght, whych bare a lytter, and therein lyyng a syke knyght.
CMMALORY-M4,653.4366

And when he was nyghe the crosse he there abode stylle.
CMMALORY-M4,653.4367

All thys sir Launcelot sye CMMALORY-M4,653.4368

and behylde hit, CMMALORY-M4,653.4369

for he slepte nat veryly, CMMALORY-M4,653.4370

and he herde hym sey,'A, sweete Lorde!  Whan shall thys sorow leve me,
CMMALORY-M4,653.4371

and whan shall the holy vessell com by me wherethorow I shall be heled?
CMMALORY-M4,653.4372

For I have endured thus longe for litill trespasse, a full grete whyle!
'CMMALORY-M4,653.4373

Thus complayned the knyght CMMALORY-M4,653.4374

and allways sir Launcelot harde hit.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4375

So with that sir Launcelot sye the candyllstyk with the $six tapirs cam
before the crosse, CMMALORY-M4,653.4376

and he saw nobody that brought hit.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4377

Also there cam a table of sylver and the holy vessell of the Sankgreall
which sir Launcelot had sene toforetyme in kynge $Pescheors house.
CMMALORY-M4,653.4378

And therewith the syke knyght sette hym up, CMMALORY-M4,653.4379

and hylde up both hys hondys, CMMALORY-M4,653.4380

and seyde,'Fayre swete Lorde whych ys here within the holy vessell!  take
hede unto me, that I may be hole of thys malody!  'CMMALORY-M4,653.4381

And therewith on hys hondys and kneys he wente so nyghe that he towched
the holy vessell and kyst hit, CMMALORY-M4,653.4382

and anone he was hole.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4383

And than he seyde,'Lorde God, I thanke The, CMMALORY-M4,653.4384

for I am helyd of thys syknes! 'CMMALORY-M4,653.4385

So whan the holy vessell had bene there a grete whyle hit went unto the
chapell with the chaundeler and the lyght, so that sir Launcelot wyst
nat where hit was becom; CMMALORY-M4,653.4386

for he was overtakyn with synne, that he had no power to ryse agayne
the holy vessell.  Wherefore aftir that many men seyde hym shame,
CMMALORY-M4,653.4387

but he toke repentaunce aftir that.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4388

Than the syke knyght dressed hym up CMMALORY-M4,653.4389

and kyssed the crosse.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4390

Anone hys squyre brought hym hys armys CMMALORY-M4,653.4391

and $asked hys lorde how he ded.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4392

'Sertes,'seyde he,'I thanke God, ryght well!  CMMALORY-M4,653.4393

Thorow the holy vessell I am heled.  CMMALORY-M4,653.4394

But I have mervayle of thys slepyng knyght that he had no power to awake
whan thys holy vessell was brought hydir. 'CMMALORY-M4,653.4395

'I dare well sey,'seyde the squyre,'that he dwellith in som dedly synne
whereof he was never confessed. 'CMMALORY-M4,653.4396

<P_654>

'Be my fayth,'seyde the knyght,'whatsomever he be, he ys un-happy.
CMMALORY-M4,654.4398

For as I deme he ys of the felyship of the Rounde Table whych ys entird
in the queste of the Sankgreall. 'CMMALORY-M4,654.4399

'Sir,'seyde the squyre,'here I have brought you all youre armys save
youre helme and youre swerde, CMMALORY-M4,654.4400

and therefore, be myne assente, now may ye take thys knyghtes helme and
his swerde. 'CMMALORY-M4,654.4401

And so he dud.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4402

And whan he was clene armed he toke there sir Launcelottis horse,
CMMALORY-M4,654.4403

for he was bettir than hys, CMMALORY-M4,654.4404

and so departed they frome the crosse.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4405

Than anone sir Launcelot waked and sett hym up CMMALORY-M4,654.4406

and bethought hym what he had sene there and whether hit were dremys
or nat.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4407

Ryght so harde he a voyse that seyde,'Sir Launcelot, more harder than ys
the stone, and more bitter than ys the woode, and more naked and barer
than ys the lyeff of the fygge-tre!  CMMALORY-M4,654.4408

Therefore go thou from hens, CMMALORY-M4,654.4409

and withdraw the from thys holy places! 'CMMALORY-M4,654.4410

And whan sir Launcelot herde thys he was passyng hevy CMMALORY-M4,654.4411

and wyst nat what to do.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4412

And so departed sore wepynge CMMALORY-M4,654.4413

and cursed the tyme that he was $borne, CMMALORY-M4,654.4414

for than he demed never to have worship more.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4415

For tho wordis wente to hys herte, tylle that he knew where-fore he was
called so.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4416

Than sir Launcelot wente to the crosse CMMALORY-M4,654.4417

and founde hys helme, hys swerde, and hys $horse away.
CMMALORY-M4,654.4418

And than he called hymselff a verry wrecch and moste unhappy of all
knyghtes, CMMALORY-M4,654.4419

and there he seyde,'My synne and my wyckednes hath brought me unto
grete dis-honoure!  CMMALORY-M4,654.4420

For whan I sought worldly adventures for worldely de-syres I ever encheved
them CMMALORY-M4,654.4421

and had the bettir in every place, CMMALORY-M4,654.4422

and never was I discomfite in no quarell, were hit ryght were hit wronge.
CMMALORY-M4,654.4423

And now I take uppon me the adventures to seke of holy thynges,
CMMALORY-M4,654.4424

now I se and undirstonde that myne olde synne hyndryth me and shamyth me,
that I had no power to stirre nother speke whan the holy bloode appered
before me. 'CMMALORY-M4,654.4425

So thus he sorowed tyll hit was day, CMMALORY-M4,654.4426

and harde the fowlys synge; CMMALORY-M4,654.4427

than somwhat he was comforted.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4428

But when sir Launcelot myssed his horse and hys harneyse than he wyst
well God was displesed with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,654.4429

And so he departed frome the crosse on foote into a fayre <P_655>
foreyste, CMMALORY-M4,655.4430

and so by pryme he cam to an hyghe hylle CMMALORY-M4,655.4431

and founde an ermytage and an ermyte therein whych was goyng unto masse.
CMMALORY-M4,655.4432

And than sir Launcelot kneled downe CMMALORY-M4,655.4433

and cryed on oure Lorde mercy for hys wycked workys.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4434

So whan masse was done sir Launcelot called hym, CMMALORY-M4,655.4435

and prayde hym for seynte charite` for to hyre hys lyff.
CMMALORY-M4,655.4436

'With a good wylle,'seyde the good man, CMMALORY-M4,655.4437

and asked hym whethir he was of kyng Arthurs and of the felyship of the
Table Rounde.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4438

'Ye, forsoth, sir, CMMALORY-M4,655.4439

and my name ys sir Launcelot du Lake, that hath bene ryght well seyde off.
CMMALORY-M4,655.4440

And now my good fortune ys chonged, CMMALORY-M4,655.4441

for I am the moste wrecch of the worlde. 'CMMALORY-M4,655.4442

The ermyte behylde hym CMMALORY-M4,655.4443

and had mervayle whye he was so abaysshed.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4444

'Sir,'seyde the ermyte,'ye ought to thanke God more than ony knyght
lyvynge, CMMALORY-M4,655.4445

for He hath caused you to have more worldly worship than ony knyght that
ys now lyvynge.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4446

And for youre presumpcion to take uppon you in dedely synne for to be
in Hys presence, where Hys fleyssh and Hys blood was, which caused you
ye myght nat se hyt with youre worldely yen, CMMALORY-M4,655.4447

for He woll nat appere where such synners bene but if hit be unto their
grete hurte other unto their shame.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4448

And there is no knyght now lyvynge that ought to yelde God so grete
thanke os ye, CMMALORY-M4,655.4449

for He hath yevyn you beaute`, bownte`, semelynes, and grete strengthe
over all other knyghtes.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4450

And therefore ye ar the more beholdyn unto God than ony other man to
love Hym and drede Hym, CMMALORY-M4,655.4451

for youre strengthe and your manhode woll litill avayle you and God be
agaynste you. 'CMMALORY-M4,655.4452

Than sir Launcelot wepte with hevy harte CMMALORY-M4,655.4453

and seyde,'Now I know well ye sey me sothe. 'CMMALORY-M4,655.4454

'Sir,'seyde the good man,'hyde none olde synne frome me.
'CMMALORY-M4,655.4455

'Truly,'seyde sir Launcelot,'that were me full lothe to discover ,
CMMALORY-M4,655.4456

for thys fourtene yere I never discoverde one thynge that I have used,
CMMALORY-M4,655.4457

and that may I now wyghte my shame and my disadventures. '
CMMALORY-M4,655.4458

And than he tolde there the good man all hys lyff, and how he had loved
a quene unmesurabely and oute of mesure longe.  CMMALORY-M4,655.4459

'And all my grete dedis of armys that I have done for the moste party
was for the quenys sake, CMMALORY-M4,655.4460

and for hir sake wolde I do batayle were hit ryght other wronge.
CMMALORY-M4,655.4461

And never dud I batayle all only $for <P_656> Goddis sake, but
for to wynne worship and to cause me the bettir to be beloved,
CMMALORY-M4,656.4462

and litill or nought I thanked never God of hit. 'CMMALORY-M4,656.4463

Than sir Launcelot seyde,'Sir, I pray you counceyle me. '
CMMALORY-M4,656.4464

'Sir, I woll counceyle you,'seyde the ermyte,'$yf ye shall ensure me by
youre knyghthode ye shall no more com in that quenys fely-ship as much
as ye may forbere. 'CMMALORY-M4,656.4465

And than sir Launcelot promysed hym that he nolde, by the faythe of
hys body.  CMMALORY-M4,656.4466

'Sir, loke that your harte and youre mowth accorde,'seyde the good
man,'and I shall ensure you ye shall have the more worship than ever ye
had. 'CMMALORY-M4,656.4467

'Holy fadir,'seyde sir Launcelot,'I mervayle of the voyce that seyde to
me mervayles wordes, as ye have herde toforehonde.  'CMMALORY-M4,656.4468

'Have ye no mervayle,'seyde the good man,'thereoff, CMMALORY-M4,656.4469

for hit semyth well God lovith you.  CMMALORY-M4,656.4470

For men may undirstonde a stone ys harde of kynde, and namely one more
than another, CMMALORY-M4,656.4471

and that ys to undirstonde by the, sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,656.4472

for thou wolt nat leve thy synne for no goodnes that God hath sente the.
CMMALORY-M4,656.4473

Therefore thou arte more harder than ony stone, CMMALORY-M4,656.4474

and woldyst never be made neyssh nother by watir nother by fyre,
CMMALORY-M4,656.4475

and that ys the hete of the Holy Goste may nat entir in the.
CMMALORY-M4,656.4476

'Now take hede, CMMALORY-M4,656.4477

in all the worlde men shall nat fynde one knyght to whom oure Lorde hath
yevyn so much of grace as He hath lente the, CMMALORY-M4,656.4478

for He hathe yeffyn the fayrenes with semelynes; CMMALORY-M4,656.4479

also He hath yevyn the wytte and discression to know good frome ille.
CMMALORY-M4,656.4480

He hath also yevyn prouesse and hardinesse, and gevyn the to worke
so largely that thou hast had the bettir all thy dayes of thy lyff
where-somever thou cam.  CMMALORY-M4,656.4481

And now oure Lorde wolde suffir the no lenger but that thou shalt know
Hym whether $thou wolt other nylt.  And why the voyce called the bitterer
than the woode, CMMALORY-M4,656.4482

for wheresomever much synne dwellith there may be but lytyll swetnesse;
wherefore thou art lykened to an olde rottyn tre.  CMMALORY-M4,656.4483

'Now have I shewed the why thou art harder than the stone and bitterer
than the tre; CMMALORY-M4,656.4484

now shall I shew the why thou art more naked and barer than the fygge-tre.
CMMALORY-M4,656.4485

Hit befelle that oure Lorde on Palme Sonday preched in Jerusalem,
CMMALORY-M4,656.4486

and there He founde in the people that all hardnes was herberowd in them
, CMMALORY-M4,656.4487

and there He founde in all <P_657> the towne nat one that wolde herberow
Hym.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4488

And than He wente oute of the towne CMMALORY-M4,657.4489

and founde in myddis the way a fygge-tre which was ryght fayre and well
garnysshed of levys, CMMALORY-M4,657.4490

but fruyte had hit none.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4491

Than oure Lorde cursed the tre that bare no fruyte; CMMALORY-M4,657.4492

that betokenyth the fyg-tre unto Jerusalem that had levys and no fruyte.
CMMALORY-M4,657.4493

So thou, sir Launcelot, whan the Holy Grayle was brought before the,
He founde in the no fruyte, nother good thought nother good wylle,
and defouled with lechory. 'CMMALORY-M4,657.4494

'Sertes,'seyde sir Launcelot,'all that ye have seyde ys trew,
CMMALORY-M4,657.4495

and frome hensforewarde I caste me, by the grace of God, never to be so
wycked as I have bene but as to sew knyghthode and to do fetys of armys.
'CMMALORY-M4,657.4496

Than thys good man joyned sir Launcelot suche penaunce as he myght do
and to sew knyghthode, CMMALORY-M4,657.4497

and so assoyled hym, CMMALORY-M4,657.4498

and prayde hym to abyde with hym all that day.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4499

'I woll well,'seyde sir Launcelot, CMMALORY-M4,657.4500

'for I have nother helme, horse, ne swerde. 'CMMALORY-M4,657.4501

'As for that,'seyde the good man,'I shall helpe you or to-morne at evyn
of an horse and all that longith unto you. 'CMMALORY-M4,657.4502

And than sir Launcelot repented hym gretly of hys myssededys.
CMMALORY-M4,657.4503

HERE LEVITH THE TALE OF SIR LAUNCELOT CMMALORY-M4,657.4504

AND BEGYNNYTH OF SIR PERCYVALE DE GALIS.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4505

<heading>

III.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4507

SIR PERCEVAL CMMALORY-M4,657.4508

<$$heading>

Now seyth the tale that whan sir Launcelot was ryddyn aftir sir Galahad
, the whych had all thes adventures aboven seyd, sir Percivale turned
agayne unto the recluse where he demed to have tydynges of that knyght
that sir Launcelot folowed.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4510

And so he kneled at hir wyndow, CMMALORY-M4,657.4511

and the recluse opened hit CMMALORY-M4,657.4512

and asked sir Percivale what he wolde.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4513

'Madam,'he seyde,'I am a knyght of kyng Arthurs courte
CMMALORY-M4,657.4514

and my name ys sir Percivale de Galis. 'CMMALORY-M4,657.4515

Whan the recluse herde his name she had grete joy of hym,
CMMALORY-M4,657.4516

for mykyll she loved hym toforn passyng ony other knyght;
CMMALORY-M4,657.4517

she ought so to do, CMMALORY-M4,657.4518

for she was hys awnte.  CMMALORY-M4,657.4519

And than she commaunded the gatis <P_658> to be opyn, CMMALORY-M4,658.4520

and there he had grete chere, as grete as she myght make hym or ly in
hir power.  CMMALORY-M4,658.4521

So on the morne sir Percyvale wente to the recluse CMMALORY-M4,658.4522

and asked her if she knew that knyght with the whyght shylde.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4523

'Sir,'seyde she,'why woll ye wete? 'CMMALORY-M4,658.4524

'Truly, madam,'seyde sir Percyvale,'I shall never be well at ease tyll
that I know of that knyghtes felyship and that I may fyght with hym,
CMMALORY-M4,658.4525

for I may nat leve hym so lyghtly, CMMALORY-M4,658.4526

for I have the shame as yette. 'CMMALORY-M4,658.4527

'A, sir Percyvale! 'seyde she,'wolde ye fyght with hym?
CMMALORY-M4,658.4528

I se well ye have grete wyll to be slayne, as youre fadir was thorow
outerageousnes slayne. 'CMMALORY-M4,658.4529

'Madam, hit semyth by your wordis that ye know me. ' CMMALORY-M4,658.4530

'Yee,'seyde she,'I well oughte to know you, CMMALORY-M4,658.4531

for I am your awnte, allthoughe I be in a poore place.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4532

For som men called me somtyme the Quene of the Wast Landis,
CMMALORY-M4,658.4533

and I was called the quene of moste rychesse in the worlde.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4534

And hit pleased me never so much my rychesse as doth my poverte`.
'CMMALORY-M4,658.4535

Than Percyvale wepte for verry pite` whan he knew hit was hys awnte.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4536

'A, fayre nevew,'seyde she,'whan herde you tydynges of youre
modir? 'CMMALORY-M4,658.4537

'Truly,'seyde he,'I herde none of hir, CMMALORY-M4,658.4538

but I dreme of hir muche in my slepe, CMMALORY-M4,658.4539

and therefore I wote nat whethir she be dede other alyve. '
CMMALORY-M4,658.4540

'Sertes, fayre nevew, youre modir ys dede, CMMALORY-M4,658.4541

for aftir youre departynge frome her she toke such a sorow that anone
as she was confessed she dyed. 'CMMALORY-M4,658.4542

'Now god have mercy on hir soule! 'seyde sir Percyvale.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4543

'Hit sore forthynkith me; CMMALORY-M4,658.4544

but all we muste change the lyff.  CMMALORY-M4,658.4545

Now, fayre awnte, what ys that knyght?  CMMALORY-M4,658.4546

I deme hit be he that bare the rede armys on Whytsonday. '
CMMALORY-M4,658.4547

'Wyte you well,'seyde she,'that this ys he, CMMALORY-M4,658.4548

for othirwyse ougth he nat to do but to go in rede armys.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4549

And that same knyght hath no peere, CMMALORY-M4,658.4550

for he worchith all by myracle, CMMALORY-M4,658.4551

and he shall never be overcom of none erthly mannys hande.
CMMALORY-M4,658.4552

'Also Merlyon made the Rounde Table in tokenyng of rowndnes of the worlde,
CMMALORY-M4,658.4553

for men sholde by the Rounde Table undirstonde the <P_659> rowndenes
signyfyed by ryght.  CMMALORY-M4,659.4554

For all the worlde, crystenyd and hethyn, repayryth unto the Rounde
Table, CMMALORY-M4,659.4555

and whan they ar chosyn to be of the felyshyp of the Rounde
Table they thynke hemselff more blessed and more in worship
than {they_think_themself_if} they had gotyn halff the worlde.
CMMALORY-M4,659.4556

'And ye have sene that they have loste hir fadirs and hir modirs and
all hir kynne, and hir wyves and chyldren, for to be of youre felyship.
CMMALORY-M4,659.4557

Hit ys well seyne be you, CMMALORY-M4,659.4558

for synes ye departed from your modir ye wolde never se her, ye founde
such felyship at the Table Rounde.  CMMALORY-M4,659.4559

'Whan Merlyon had ordayned the Rounde Table he seyde,"By them whych sholde
be felowys of the Rounde Table the trouth of the Sankgreall sholde be
well knowyn. "CMMALORY-M4,659.4560

And men asked hym how they myght know them that sholde best do and to
encheve the Sankgreall.  CMMALORY-M4,659.4561

Than he seyde,"There sholde be three whyght bullis sholde encheve hit,
CMMALORY-M4,659.4562

and the two sholde be maydyns CMMALORY-M4,659.4563

and the thirde sholde be chaste.  CMMALORY-M4,659.4564

And one of thos three shold passe hys fadir as much as the lyon passith
the lybarde, both of strength and of hardines. "CMMALORY-M4,659.4565

'They that herde Merlion sey so seyde thus: CMMALORY-M4,659.4566

"Sitthyn there shall be such a knyght, thou sholdyst ordayne by thy
craufftes a syge, that no man sholde sytte in hit but he all only that
shold passe all other knyghtes. "CMMALORY-M4,659.4567

Than Merlyon answerde that he wold so do, CMMALORY-M4,659.4568

and than he made the Syge Perelous <em> in the <$$em> whych Galahad sate
at hys mete on Whyttsonday last past. 'CMMALORY-M4,659.4569

'Now, Madam,'seyde sir Percyvale,'so much have I herde of you that be my

CMMALORY-M4,659.4570

And for Goddis love, fayre awnte, can ye teche me $where I myght
fynde hym?  CMMALORY-M4,659.4571

For much I wolde love the felyship of hym. 'CMMALORY-M4,659.4572

'Fayre nevew,'seyde she,'ye muste ryde unto a castell, the whych ys
called Gooth, where he hath a cousyn jermayne, CMMALORY-M4,659.4573

And as he techith you, sewith afftir as faste as ye can;
CMMALORY-M4,659.4575

Than departed sir Percivale frome hys awnte, aythir makyng grete sorow.

And anone he was ware of an house closed well with wallys and depe dyches

Than sir Percivale aspyed that therein was a man or a woman,
CMMALORY-M4,660.4591

And ever he hylde up hys hondys agaynst oure Lordis Body

'Sir,'seyde the good man,'ye have herde much of Joseph of Aramathy ;

And whan the good man undirstood hys name he made grete joy of hym.

And he mette in a valey aboute twenty men of armys whych bare in a beere

and smote the formyste horse and man to the erth.  CMMALORY-M4,661.4644

And whan his speare was brokyn he sette hys honde to hys swerde

And whan sir Percyvale saw hym chace them so, he made grete <P_662>

But ever sir Galahad rode fast, that at the last he past oute of hys

'A, fayre frende,'seyde sir Percivale,'as ever y may do for you, and

'Sir,'seyde the yoman,'I am ryght hevy for you, CMMALORY-M4,662.4664

'CMMALORY-M4,662.4666

'That woll I nat,'seyde sir Percivale.  CMMALORY-M4,662.4667

And so they departed, CMMALORY-M4,662.4668

and sir Percivale sette hym downe under a tre CMMALORY-M4,662.4669

And as he sate there cam a knyght rydynge on the horse that the yoman

And anone the yoman com rydynge and pryckyng aftir as fast as he myght

and asked sir Percivale if he saw ony knyght rydyng on hys blacke steede.
CMMALORY-M4,662.4674

'Ye, sir, forsothe.  Why aske ye me, sir? 'CMMALORY-M4,662.4675

'A, sir!  that steede he hath benomme me with strengthe,
CMMALORY-M4,662.4676

wherefore my lorde woll sle me in what place somever he fyndith me.
'CMMALORY-M4,662.4677

'Well,'seyde sir Percyvale,'what woldist thou that I ded?
CMMALORY-M4,662.4678

Thou seest well that I am on foote.  CMMALORY-M4,662.4679

But and I had a good horse I sholde soone brynge hym agayne. '
CMMALORY-M4,662.4680

'Sir,'seyde the yoman,'take my hakeney CMMALORY-M4,662.4681

and I shall sew you on foote to wete how that ye shall spede. '
CMMALORY-M4,662.4683

<P_663>

Than sir Percivale bestrode the hakeney CMMALORY-M4,663.4685

and rode as faste as he myght, CMMALORY-M4,663.4686

and at the last he saw that knyght.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4687

And than he cryde,'Knyght, turne agayne! 'CMMALORY-M4,663.4688

And he turned CMMALORY-M4,663.4689

And there he had a grete falle CMMALORY-M4,663.4692

and the other rode hys way.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4693

And than sir Percivale was wood wrothe CMMALORY-M4,663.4694

Whan sir Percivale saw he wolde nat turne he kest away shylde, helme

and seyde,'Now I am a verry wreche, cursed and moste unhappy of all

So in thys sorow there he abode all that day tyll hit was nyght,
CMMALORY-M4,663.4702

and than he was faynte CMMALORY-M4,663.4703

and leyde hym downe CMMALORY-M4,663.4704

and slepte tyll hit was mydnyght.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4705

And than he awaked CMMALORY-M4,663.4706

and saw before hym a woman whych seyde unto hym ryght fyersely,' sir
Percivale, what dost thou here? 'CMMALORY-M4,663.4707

'I do nother good nother grete ille. 'CMMALORY-M4,663.4708

'If thou wolt ensure me,'seyde she,'that thou wolt fulfylle my wylle

sir Percivale was glad of hir profer CMMALORY-M4,663.4710

and ensured hir to fulfylle all hir desire.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4711

'Than abydith me here, and I shall go fecche you an horse. '
CMMALORY-M4,663.4712

And so she cam sone agayne CMMALORY-M4,663.4713

and brought an horse with her that was $inkly black.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4714

Whan sir Percyvale behylde that horse he mervaylde that he was so grete
and so well apparayled.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4715

And natforthan he was so hardy CMMALORY-M4,663.4716

he lepte uppon hym CMMALORY-M4,663.4717

and toke none hede off hymselff.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4718

And anone as he was uppon hym he threst to hym with hys spurres,
CMMALORY-M4,663.4719

and so rode by a foreste; CMMALORY-M4,663.4720

and the moone shoone clere, CMMALORY-M4,663.4721

and within an owre and lasse he bare hym four dayes journey thense untyll
he com to a rowghe watir whych rored, CMMALORY-M4,663.4722

and that horse wolde have borne hym into hit.  CMMALORY-M4,663.4723

And whan sir Percivale cam nye the brymme he saw the watir so boysteous
he doutted to passe over hit, CMMALORY-M4,663.4724

and than he made a sygne of <P_664> the crosse in hys forehed.
CMMALORY-M4,664.4725

Whan the fende felte hym so charged he shooke of sir Percivale,
CMMALORY-M4,664.4726

and he wente into the watir cryynge <em> and rorynge <$$em> and makying
grete sorowe, CMMALORY-M4,664.4727

and hit semed unto hym that the watir brente.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4728

Than sir Percivale perceyved hit was a fynde, the whych wolde have
broughte hym unto perdicion.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4729

Than he commended hymselff unto God, CMMALORY-M4,664.4730

and prayde oure Lorde to kepe hym frome all suche temptacions.
CMMALORY-M4,664.4731

And so he prayde all that nyght tylle on the morne that hit was day,
CMMALORY-M4,664.4732

and anone he saw he was in a wylde mounteyne whych was closed with the
se nyghe all aboute, that he myght se no londe aboute hym whych myghte
releve hym, but wylde bestes.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4733

And than he wente downe into a valey, CMMALORY-M4,664.4734

and there he saw a serpente brynge a yonge lyon by the necke,
CMMALORY-M4,664.4735

and so he cam by sir Percivale.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4736

So with that com a grete lyon cryynge and $roryng aftir the serpente.
CMMALORY-M4,664.4737

And as faste as sir Percivale saw thys he hyghed hym thydir,
CMMALORY-M4,664.4738

but the lyon had overtake the serpente CMMALORY-M4,664.4739

and began batayle with hym.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4740

And than sir Percivale thought to helpe the lyon, CMMALORY-M4,664.4741

for he was the more naturall beste of the two, CMMALORY-M4,664.4742

and therewith he drew hys swerde CMMALORY-M4,664.4743

and sette hys shylde afore hym, CMMALORY-M4,664.4744

and there he gaff the serpente suche a buffett that he had a dedely
wounde.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4745

Whan the lyon saw that, he made no sembelaunte to fyght with hym
CMMALORY-M4,664.4746

but made hym all the chere that a beest myghte make a man.
CMMALORY-M4,664.4747

Whan sir Percivale perceyved hit he kyst downe his shylde whych was
brokyn, CMMALORY-M4,664.4748

and than he dud of hys helme for to gadir wynde, CMMALORY-M4,664.4749

for he was gretly chaffed with the serpente; CMMALORY-M4,664.4750

and the lyon wente allwey aboute hym fawnynge as a spaynell,
CMMALORY-M4,664.4751

and than he stroked hym on the necke and on the sholdirs
CMMALORY-M4,664.4752

and thanked God of the feliship of that beste.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4753

And aboute noone the lyon toke hys lityll whelpe CMMALORY-M4,664.4754

and trussed hym CMMALORY-M4,664.4755

and bare hym there he com fro.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4756

Than was sir Percivale alone.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4757

And as the tale tellith, he was at that tyme, one of the men of the
worlde whych moste beleved in oure Lorde Jesu Cryste, CMMALORY-M4,664.4758

for in tho dayes there was but fewe folk at that tyme that beleved
perfitely; CMMALORY-M4,664.4759

for in tho dayes the sonne spared nat the fadir no more than a straunger.
CMMALORY-M4,664.4760

And so sir Percivale comforted hymselff in oure Lorde Jesu
CMMALORY-M4,664.4761

and besought Hym that no temptacion sholde brynge hym oute of Goddys
servys, but to endure as His trew champyon.  CMMALORY-M4,664.4762

Thus whan sir <P_665> Percyvale had preyde he saw the lyon com towarde
hym CMMALORY-M4,665.4763

and cowched downe at his feet.  CMMALORY-M4,665.4764

And so all that nyght the lyon and he slepte togydirs.
CMMALORY-M4,665.4765

And whan sir Percivale slepte he dremed a mervaylous dreme; that two
ladyes mette with hym, and that one sate uppon a lyon, and that other
sate uppon a serpente; and that one of hem was yonge, and that other
was olde, and the yongist, hym thought, seyde,'sir Percyvale, my lorde

CMMALORY-M4,665.4766

And if thou be overcom thou shalt nat be quytte for losyng of ony of

but thou shalt be shamed for ever to the worldis ende. '
CMMALORY-M4,665.4768

And than he asked her what was hir lorde, CMMALORY-M4,665.4769

and she seyde'the grettist lorde of the worlde'.  CMMALORY-M4,665.4770

And so she departed suddeynly, that he wyst nat where.
CMMALORY-M4,665.4771

Than com forth the tothir lady, that rode uppon the serpente,
CMMALORY-M4,665.4772

and she seyde,'sir Percivale, I playne unto you of that ye have done

and I have nat offended unto you. 'CMMALORY-M4,665.4774

'Sertes, madam,'seyde he,'unto you nor no lady I never offended.
'CMMALORY-M4,665.4775

'Yes,'seyde she,'I shall sey you why.  CMMALORY-M4,665.4776

I have norysshed in thys place a grete whyle a serpente whych pleased

Sey me for what cause ye slew hym, CMMALORY-M4,665.4779

for the lyon was nat youres. 'CMMALORY-M4,665.4780

'Madam, I know well the lyon was nat myne, CMMALORY-M4,665.4781

but for the lyon ys more of jantiller nature than the serpente, therefore
I slew hym, CMMALORY-M4,665.4782

and $me $semyth {TEXT:mesemyth} I dud nat amysse agaynst you.
CMMALORY-M4,665.4783

Madam,'seyde he,'what wolde ye that I dud? 'CMMALORY-M4,665.4784

'I wolde,'seyde she,'for the amendis of my beste that ye becam my

And than he answerde CMMALORY-M4,665.4786

and seyde,'That woll I nat graunte you. 'CMMALORY-M4,665.4787

'No? 'seyde she. 'Truly, ye were never but my servaunte syn ye resseyved

Therefore I you ensure, in what place that I may fynde you

'CMMALORY-M4,665.4789

And so she departed fro sir Percivale CMMALORY-M4,665.4790

and leffte hym slepynge, <P_666> whych was sore travayled of hys avision.
CMMALORY-M4,666.4791

And on the morne he arose CMMALORY-M4,666.4792

and he was passynge fyeble.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4794

Than was sir Percivale ware in the see where com a shippe saylyng toward

'Doute ye nat,'seyde the good man, CMMALORY-M4,666.4804

'and ye be so trew a knyght as the Order of Shevalry requyrith, and of
herte as ye ought to be, ye shold nat doute that none enemy shold slay
you. 'CMMALORY-M4,666.4805

'What ar ye? 'seyde sir Percyvale.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4806

'Sir, I am of a strange contrey, CMMALORY-M4,666.4807

and hydir I com to comforte you. 'CMMALORY-M4,666.4808

'Sir,'seyde sir Percivale,'what signifieth my dreme that I dremed thys
nyght? 'CMMALORY-M4,666.4809

And there he tolde hym alltogydir.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4810

'She which rode uppon the lyon, hit betokenyth the new law of Holy
Chirche, that is to undirstonde fayth, good hope, belyeve and baptyme ;
CMMALORY-M4,666.4811

for she semed yonger $than that othir hit ys grete reson,
CMMALORY-M4,666.4812

for she was borne in the Resurreccion and the Passion of oure Lorde
Jesu Cryste.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4813

And for grete love she cam to the to warne the of thy grete batayle that
shall befalle the. 'CMMALORY-M4,666.4814

'With whom,'seyde sir Percivale,'shall I fyght? ' CMMALORY-M4,666.4815

'With the moste douteful champion of the worlde, CMMALORY-M4,666.4816

for, as the lady seyde, but if thou quyte the welle thou shalt nat be
quytte by losyng of one membir, CMMALORY-M4,666.4817

but thou shalt be shamed to the worldis ende.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4818

And she that rode on the serpente signifieth the olde law,
CMMALORY-M4,666.4819

and that serpente betokenyth a fynde.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4820

And why she blamed the that thou slewyst hir servaunte, hit betokenyth
nothynge $aboute the serpente ye slewe; CMMALORY-M4,666.4821

that betokenyth the devyll that thou rodist on to the roche.
CMMALORY-M4,666.4822

And whan thou madist a sygne of the crosse, there thou slewyst hym
CMMALORY-M4,666.4823

and put away hys power.  CMMALORY-M4,666.4824

And whan she asked the amendis and to becom hir man, than thou saydist
nay, CMMALORY-M4,666.4825

that was to make the beleve on her and leve thy baptym. '
CMMALORY-M4,666.4826

So he commaunded sir Percivale to departe, CMMALORY-M4,666.4827

and so he lepte over <P_667> the boorde, CMMALORY-M4,667.4828

and the shippe and all wente away CMMALORY-M4,667.4829

he wyste nat whydir.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4830

Than he wente up into the roche CMMALORY-M4,667.4831

and founde the lyon whych allway bare hym felyship, CMMALORY-M4,667.4832

and he stroked hym uppon the backe CMMALORY-M4,667.4833

and had grete joy of hym.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4834

Bi that sir Percivale had byddyn there tyll mydday he saw a shippe
com saylyng in the see as all the wynde of the worlde had dryven hit,
CMMALORY-M4,667.4835

and so hit londid undir that rocche.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4836

And when sir Percivale saw thys he hyghed hym thydir CMMALORY-M4,667.4837

and founde the shippe coverde with sylke more blacker than ony bere`
, CMMALORY-M4,667.4838

and therein was a jantillwoman of grete beaute`, CMMALORY-M4,667.4839

and she was clothe rychly, CMMALORY-M4,667.4840

there myght be none bettir.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4841

And whan she saw sir Percivale she asked hym who brought hym into thys
wylderness'where ye be never lyke to passe hense, CMMALORY-M4,667.4842

for ye shall dye here for hunger and myscheff. 'CMMALORY-M4,667.4843

'Damesell,'seyde sir Percivale,'I serve the beste man of the worlde,
CMMALORY-M4,667.4844

and in Hys servyse He woll nat suffir me to dye, CMMALORY-M4,667.4845

for who that $knockith shall entir, CMMALORY-M4,667.4846

and who that askyth shall have, CMMALORY-M4,667.4847

and who that sekith Hym, He hydyth Hym not unto Hys wordys. '
CMMALORY-M4,667.4848

But than she seyde,'Sir Percivale, wote ye what I am? '
CMMALORY-M4,667.4849

'Who taught you my name? 'now seyde sir Percivale.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4850

'I knowe you bettir than {that_I_know_you} ye wene: CMMALORY-M4,667.4851

I com but late oute of the Waste Foreyste where I founde the Rede Knyght
with the whyghte shylde.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4852

'A, fayre damesell,'seyde he,'that knyght wolde I fayne mete
withall. 'CMMALORY-M4,667.4853

'Sir knyght,'seyde she,'and ye woll ensure me by the fayth that ye
owghe unto knyghthode that ye shall do my wyll what tyme I somon you,
and I shall brynge you unto that knyght. 'CMMALORY-M4,667.4854

'Yes,'he seyde,'I shall promyse you to fullfylle youre desyre.
'CMMALORY-M4,667.4855

'Well,'seyde she,'now shall I telle you.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4856

I saw hym in the Waste Foreyste chasyng two knyghtes unto the watir
whych ys callede Mortayse, CMMALORY-M4,667.4857

and they drove into that watir for drede of dethe.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4858

And the two knyghtes passed over, CMMALORY-M4,667.4859

and the Rede Knyght passed aftir, CMMALORY-M4,667.4860

and there hys horse was drowned, CMMALORY-M4,667.4861

and he thorow grete strenghte ascaped unto the londe. '
CMMALORY-M4,667.4862

Thus she tolde hym, CMMALORY-M4,667.4863

and sir Percivale was passynge glad thereoff.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4864

Than she asked hym if he had ete ony mete late.  CMMALORY-M4,667.4865

'Nay, madam, truly I yeete no mete nyghe thes three dayes,
CMMALORY-M4,667.4866

but <P_668> late here I spake with a good man that fedde me with hys
good wordys <em> and holy <$$em> CMMALORY-M4,668.4867

and refreyshed me gretly. 'CMMALORY-M4,668.4868

'A, sir knyght, that same man,'seyde she,'ys an inchaunter and a
multiplier of wordis, CMMALORY-M4,668.4869

for and ye belyve hym, ye shall be playnly shamed and dye in thys roche
for pure hunger and be etyn with wylde bestis.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4870

And ye be a yonge man and a goodly knyght, CMMALORY-M4,668.4871

and I shall helpe you and ye woll'CMMALORY-M4,668.4872

'What ar ye,'seyde sir Percivale,'that proferyth me thus so grete
kyndenesse? 'CMMALORY-M4,668.4873

'I am,'seyde she,'a jantillwoman that am diseryte, whych was the rychest
woman of the worlde. 'CMMALORY-M4,668.4874

'Damesell,'seyde sir Percivale,'who hath disheryte you?
CMMALORY-M4,668.4875

For I have grete pite` of you. 'CMMALORY-M4,668.4876

'Sir,'seyde she,'I dwelled with the grettist man of the worlde,
CMMALORY-M4,668.4877

and he made me so fayre and so clere that there was none lyke me.
CMMALORY-M4,668.4878

And of that grete beawte` I had a litill pryde, more than I oughte to
have had.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4879

Also I sayde a worde that plesed hym nat, CMMALORY-M4,668.4880

and than he wolde nat suffir me to be no lenger in $his company.
CMMALORY-M4,668.4881

And so he drove me frome myne herytayge CMMALORY-M4,668.4882

and disheryted me for ever, CMMALORY-M4,668.4883

and he had never pite` of me nother of none of my counceyle nother of
my courte.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4884

And sitthyn, sir knyght, hit hath befallyn me to be so over-throwyn and
all myne, CMMALORY-M4,668.4885

yet I have benomme hym som of hys men and made hem to becom my men,
CMMALORY-M4,668.4886

for they aske never nothynge of me but I gyff hem that and much more.
CMMALORY-M4,668.4887

Thus I and my servauntes $werre ayenste hym nyght and day,
CMMALORY-M4,668.4888

therefore I know no good knyght nor no good man but I gete hem on my
syde and I may.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4889

And for that I know that ye ar a good knyght I beseche you to helpe me,
and for ye be a felowe of the Rounde Table, wherefore ye ought nat to
fayle no jantillwoman which ys disherite and she besought you of helpe.
'CMMALORY-M4,668.4890

Than sir Percivale promysed her all the helpe that he myght,
CMMALORY-M4,668.4891

and than she thanked hym.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4892

And at that tyme the wedir was hote.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4893

Than she called unto her a jantillwoman CMMALORY-M4,668.4894

and bade hir brynge forth a pavilion.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4895

And so she ded CMMALORY-M4,668.4896

and pyghte hit uppon the gravell.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4897

'Sir,'seyde she,'now may ye reste you in thys hete of thys day.
'CMMALORY-M4,668.4898

Than he thanked her, CMMALORY-M4,668.4899

and she put of hys helme and hys shylde.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4900

And there he slepte a grete whyle.  CMMALORY-M4,668.4901

<P_669>

And so he awoke CMMALORY-M4,669.4903

and asked her if she had ony mete, CMMALORY-M4,669.4904

and she seyde'yee, ye shall have inowghe. 'CMMALORY-M4,669.4905

And anone there was leyde a table, CMMALORY-M4,669.4906

and so muche meete was sette thereon that he had mervayle,
CMMALORY-M4,669.4907

for there was all maner of meetes that he cowde thynke on.
CMMALORY-M4,669.4908

Also he dranke there the strengyst wyne that ever he dranke, hym thought
, CMMALORY-M4,669.4909

and therewith he was chaffett a lityll more than he oughte to be.
CMMALORY-M4,669.4910

With that he behylde that jantilwoman, CMMALORY-M4,669.4911

and hym thought she was the fayryst creature that ever he saw.
CMMALORY-M4,669.4912

And than sir Percivale profird hir love CMMALORY-M4,669.4913

and prayde hir that she wolde be hys.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4914

Than she refused hym in a maner when he requyred her, for cause he sholde
be the more ardente on hir.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4915

And ever he sesed nat to pray hir of love.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4916

And when she saw hym well enchaffed, than she seyde,'Sir Percivale ,
wyte you well I shall nat fulfylle youre wylle but if ye swere frome
henseforthe ye shall be my trew servaunte, and to do nothynge but that
I shall commaunde you.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4917

Woll ye ensure me thys as ye be a trew knyght? 'CMMALORY-M4,669.4918

'Yee,'seyde he,'fayre lady, by the feythe of my body! '
CMMALORY-M4,669.4919

'Well,'seyde she,'now shall ye do with me what ye wyll,
CMMALORY-M4,669.4920

and now, wyte you well, ye ar the knyght in the worlde that I have moste
desyre to. 'CMMALORY-M4,669.4921

And than two squyres were $commaunded to make a bedde in myddis of the
pavelon, CMMALORY-M4,669.4922

and anone she was unclothed and leyde therein.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4923

And than sir Percivale layde hym downe by her naked.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4924

And by adventure and grace he saw hys swerde ly on the erthe $naked,
where in the pomell was a rede crosse and the sygne of the crucifixe
$therin, CMMALORY-M4,669.4925

and bethought hym of hys knyghthode and hys promyse made unto the good
man tofornehande, CMMALORY-M4,669.4926

and than he made a sygne in the forehed of hys.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4927

And therewith the pavylon turned up-so-downe CMMALORY-M4,669.4928

and than hit chonged unto a smooke and a blak clowde.
CMMALORY-M4,669.4929

And than he drad sore CMMALORY-M4,669.4930

and cryed alowde,'Fayre swete Lorde Jesu Cryste, ne lette me nat
be shamed, which was nyghe loste had nat Thy good grace bene!
'CMMALORY-M4,669.4931

And than he loked unto her shippe CMMALORY-M4,669.4932

and saw her entir therein, which seyde,'Syr Percivale, ye have betrayde
me. 'CMMALORY-M4,669.4933

And so she wente with the wynde, rorynge and yellynge, that hit semed
all the water brente after her.  CMMALORY-M4,669.4934

<P_670>

Than sir Percivale made grete sorow CMMALORY-M4,670.4936

and drew hys swerde unto hym CMMALORY-M4,670.4937

and seyde,'Sitthyn my fleyssh woll be my mayster I shall punyssh hit.
'CMMALORY-M4,670.4938

And therewith he rooff hymselff thorow the thygh, that the blood sterte
aboute hym, CMMALORY-M4,670.4939

and seyde,'A, good Lord, take thys in recompensacion of that I have
myssedone ayenste The, Lorde! 'CMMALORY-M4,670.4940

So than he clothed hym CMMALORY-M4,670.4941

and armed hym CMMALORY-M4,670.4942

and called hymself wrecche of all wrecchis: CMMALORY-M4,670.4943

'How nyghe I was loste, and to have lost that I sholde never have gotyn
agayne, that was my virginite`, CMMALORY-M4,670.4944

for that may never be recoverde aftir hit ys onys loste. '
CMMALORY-M4,670.4945

And than he stopped hys bledyng wound with a pece of hys sherte.
CMMALORY-M4,670.4946

Thus as he made hys mone he saw the same shippe com from the Oryente
that the good man was in the day before.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4947

And thys noble knyght was sore ashamed of hymselff, CMMALORY-M4,670.4948

and therewith he fylle in a sowne.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4949

And when he awooke he wente unto hym waykely, CMMALORY-M4,670.4950

and there he salewed the good man.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4951

And than he asked sir Percivale,'How haste thou done syth I departed?
'CMMALORY-M4,670.4952

'Sir,'seyde $he,'here was a jantillwoman CMMALORY-M4,670.4953

and ledde $me into dedly synne. 'CMMALORY-M4,670.4954

And there he tolde hym $all $togidirs {TEXT:alltogidirs}.
CMMALORY-M4,670.4955

'Knew ye nat that mayde? 'seyde the good man.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4956

'Sir,'seyde he,'nay, but well I wote the fynde sente hir hydir to shame
me. 'CMMALORY-M4,670.4957

'A, good knyght,'seyde he,'thou arte a foole, CMMALORY-M4,670.4958

for that jantill woman was the mayster fyende of helle, which hath pouste`
over all other devyllis.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4959

And that was the olde lady that thou saw in thyne avision rydyng on the
serpente. 'CMMALORY-M4,670.4960

Than he tolde sir Percivale how oure Lord Jesu Cryste bete hym oute of
hevyn for hys synne, whycch was the moste bryghtist angell of hevyn,
CMMALORY-M4,670.4961

and therefore he loste hys heritaige.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4962

'And that was the champion that thou fought withall, whych had overcom
the, had nat the grace of God bene.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4963

Now, sir Percivale, beware CMMALORY-M4,670.4964

and take this for an insample. 'CMMALORY-M4,670.4965

And than the good man vanysshed.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4966

Than sir Percivale toke hys armys CMMALORY-M4,670.4967

and entirde into the shippe, CMMALORY-M4,670.4968

and so he departed from thens.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4969

SO LEVITH THYS TALE CMMALORY-M4,670.4970

AND TURNYTH UNTO SIR LAUNCELOT.  CMMALORY-M4,670.4971
