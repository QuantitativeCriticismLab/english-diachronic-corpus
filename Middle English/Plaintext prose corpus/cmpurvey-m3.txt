CAP. I. CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.5

the xiiij. book is Esdre, that comprehendeth Neemye,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.17

and al is o bok anentis Ebreyes, as Jerom seith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.18

but anentis Grekis and Latyns these ben twey bookis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.19

and the xv. is Hester, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.20

the xvj. is Joob, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.21

the xvij. is the Sauter; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.22

the xviij. book, xix. and xx. ben the iij.

the first is Prouerbis, either Parablis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.24

the ij. is Eclesiastes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.25

and the iij. is Songis of Songis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.26

the xxi. book, xxij. xxiij. and xxiiij. ben
the foure grete prophetis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.27

Isaie is the first, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.28

Jeremye is the ij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.29

Ezechiel is the iij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.30

and Daniel is the fourth; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.31

the xxv. book is o book of xij. smale prophetis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.32

Osee is the first, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.33

Joel is the ij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.34

Amos is the iij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.35

Abdie is the iiij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.36

Jonas is the fyuethe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.37

and Michee is the vj.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.38

Naum is the vij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.39

Abacuk is the viij.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.40

Sofonye is the ix.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.41

Aggeye is the x.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.42

Sacharie is the xi.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.43

and Malachie is the xij.; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.44

and alle these xij. smale prophetis ben o book, and in this ordre.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.45

And what euer book in the olde testament is out of these fyue and twenty
byfore seid, shal be set among apocrifa, that is, with outen autorite
of bileue; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.46

therfore the book of Wisdom and Eclesiastici and Judith and Tobie be
not of bileue.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.47

The first book of Machabeies was founden write in Ebreu,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.48

and the ij. book of Machabeyes was writen first in Grek.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.49

Jerom seith al this sentence in the prologe on the first book of Kyngis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.50

Also the book of Baruc and the pistle of Jeremye ben not of the autorite
of the bible anentis Ebreyes, ne the preyer of Manasses, as Jerom
witnessith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.51

and how mich of the book of Hester and of Daniel is of autorite anentis
Ebreyes, and in Ebreu lettre, it is told in the same bookis by Jerom
hym self; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.52

netheles Jerom, in suynge Ebreyes, comprehendith alle these bookis in
xxij.; CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.53

for Ebreies maken oo book of the first and ij. book of Kyngis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.54

and clepen it Samuel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.55

and thei maken oo book of the iij. and iiij. book of Kyngis
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.56

and clepen it Malachym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.57

and thei comprehenden in oo book the ij. bookis of Paralipominon.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.58

But certis, litel charge is of this rikenyng, whether the bookis of
Kyngis ben noumbred foure, as Latyns doen, either tweyn, as Ebreies doen.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.59

Also litel charge is, whether Paralipominon be departid in ij.
bookis, as Latyns vsen, either be oo book aloone, as Ebreis doen;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,1.60

and so of the first book of Esdras and of Neemye, litel charge is,
whether thei ben tweyne, as Latyns and <P_I,2> Grekis vsen, other oon
aloone, as Ebreyes vsen.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.61

Netheles it semeth, that Latyns and Grekis han more reson in this rikenyng
than Ebreies han, CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.62

but hou euer these bookis ben noumbrid, alle these ben of autorite of
bileue, either of cristen feith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.63

Thanne if the first book of Esdre and the book of Neemye ben noumbrid for
tweyne, as Grekis and Latyns vsen, and if men taken Judith for a book
of holy Scripture, as the general congregacioun of clergie dide at the
Seyne of Nicene, as Jerom witnessith in the prologe on Judith, thanne in
the olde testament ben xxvij. bookis of bileue.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.64

Also Eclesiastici was writen in Ebreu, CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.65

and the book of Wisdom is not anentis Ebreies, CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.66

but sowneth Grek eloquence, CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.67

and summe olde writers affermen, that the Jew Filo made it.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.68

Therfore as holy chirche redith Judith and Tobie and the bookis of
Machabeies, but resceyueth not tho among holy Scripturis, so the chirche
redith these ij. bookis Eclesiastici and Sapience to edifying of
the peple, not to conferme the autorite of techingis of holy chirche;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.69

Jerom seith this pleynly in the prologe on Prouerbis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.70

Also Jerom translatide the first book of Esdre and Neemye,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.71

and biddith that no man delite in the dremis of the iij. and
iiij. book of Esdre that ben apocrifa, that is, not of autorite
of bileue; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.72

for anentis Ebreies the wordis of Esdre and of Neemye ben driuen in to
o book; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.73

and the bookis of the olde testament, that ben not anentis Ebreies,
and ben not of the noumbre of holy writ, owen to be cast fer awey;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.74

Jerom seith this in the prolog of Esdre.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.75

And therfore translatide not the thridde neither the fourthe book of
Esdre, that ben apocrifa; but onely the first, and of Neemye, that ben
rikened for twey bookis anentis Grekis and Latyns, and ben of autorite
of bileue.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.76

Netheles apocrifa ben seid in twey maners, CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.77

as Catholicon seith on this word apocrifa; a book is seid apocrifum,
either for the autor is vnknowen, and the treuthe therof is opyn;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.78

and hooly chirche resseyueth sich a book not to preuyng of feith, but
to lernyng of vertues; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.79

and siche ben the bookis of Judith and other, whiche Seynt Jerom noumbrith
in the prologe on Regum; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.80

either a book is seid apocrifum, for me doutith of the treuthe therof;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.81

and holy chirche resceyueth not siche bookis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.82

and siche ben the book of the +gong childhed of the Sauyour, and the book
of the takyng up of the body of Seynt Marye to heuen; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.83

Catholicon seith this on that word apocrifa.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.84

But sothely alle the bookis of the newe testament, that is, foure
gospelleris, Matheu, Mark, Luk, and Jon; xij. pistelis of Poul,
vij. smale pistils, the Dedis of Apostlis, and the Apocalips ben
fulli of autorite of bileue; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.85

therfore cristen men and wymmen, olde and +gonge, shulden studie fast
in the newe testament, CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.86

for it is of ful autorite, and opyn to vndirstonding of simple men,
as to the poyntis that be moost nedeful to saluacioun; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.87

and the same sentence is in the derkiste placis of holy writ, whiche
sentence is in the opyn placis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.88

and ech place of holy writ, bothe opyn and derk, techith mekenes and
charite; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.89

and therfore he that kepith mekenes and charite hath the trewe
vndirstondyng and perfectioun of al holi writ, as Austyn preuith in his
sermoun of the preysing of charite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.90

Therfore no simple man of wit be aferd vnmesurabli to studie in the text
of holy writ, for whi tho ben wordis of euerlastyng lif, as Petir seide
to Crist in the vj. chapitre of Jon; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.91

and the Holy Gost stirede hooly men to speke and write the wordis of
hooly writ for the coumfort and saluacioun of meke cristen men, as Petir
in the ij. pistle in the ende, and Poul in xv. chapitre
to Romayns witnessen.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.92

And no clerk be proude of the verrey vndirstondyng of holy writ, for
whi verrey vndirstonding of hooly writ with outen charite, that kepith
Goddis heestis, makith a man depper dampned, as James and Jhesu Crist
witnessen; CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.93

and pride and couetise of clerkis is cause of her blindenes and eresie,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,2.94

and priueth hem fro verrey vndir-stondyng <P_I,3> of holy writ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.95

and maken hem go quyk in to helle, as Austyn seith on the Sauter, on
that word, Descendant in infernum viventes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.96

<heading>

CAP. II. CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.98

<$$heading>

THE old testament is departid in to thre parties, in to moral
comaundementis, iudicials, and cerimonyals.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.100

Moral comaundementis techen to holde and preise and cherishe vertues,
and to fle and repreue vicis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.101

and these comaundementis bynden euer, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.102

and han strengthe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.103

for tho ben groundid in charite and reson, and in lawes of kynde.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.104

Judicials techen domes and peynes for orrible synnes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.105

and the iudicials of Moises lawe weren ful iust and profitable for men,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.106

for tho weren ordeined of God, that may not erre in his domes, and lawis,
and workis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.107

Netheles sithen Crist was maad man, and ordeyned lawe of mercy and of
charite, and wole not the deth of a sinful man, bot repentaunce and
saluacioun, cristen men ben not bounden to kepe the iudicials of Moyses
lawe, that was endid in the tyme of Cristis passioun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.108

But +git cristen lordis that han the swerd, and ben Goddis vikers, in
xiij. c=o=. to Romayns, moun punishe men, that trespassen
openly, in catel and bodyly prisoun, and somtyme bi bodily deth, whanne
the synne may not ellis be distried, neither the comynte may ellis be
stablishid in pees, as the foure doctours and other latter preuen opynly
by holy writ and resoun; CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.109

but looke that this be don for charite and comyn profit, with mercy and
compassioun of bretheren, not for couetise, nether pride, neither for
veniaunce of a mannes owne wrong.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.110

Cerymonials techen figuris and sacramentis of the olde lawe, that
figureden Crist and his deth, and the misteries of holy chirche in the
lawe of grace; CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.111

and these cerimonials ceessiden outirly, as to obligacioun, in the tyme
of Cristis deth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.112

and ben noyful and dampnable to men that kepen tho, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.113

and for that the gospel is prechid and knowen generally;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.114

for if tho cerymonyes ben kept now, the kepers of tho knowlechen,
that Crist is not +git comen, neither suffrid deth for mankynde;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.115

and this knowleching is opyn heresie; for whi the treuthe and fredom of
the gospel suffisith to saluacioun with out keping of cerymonyes maad
of God in the old lawe, and mych more with out cerimonyes of sinful men
and vnkunnynge, that ben made in the tyme of Antecrist, and of vnbyndyng
of Sathanas, in xx. c=o=. of Apocalips.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.116

Therfore as it is opyn eresie to seie, that the gospel with his treuthe
and fredom suffisith not to cristen mennes saluacioun with outen kepyng
of cerimonyes of Goddis lawe +gouen to Moyses, so it semith opyn heresie
to seie, that the gospel with his treuthe and fredom suffisith not to
saluacioun of cristen men with out kepyng of ceremonyes and statutis
of sinful men and vnkunnynge, that ben maad in the tyme of Sathanas and
of Antecrist.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.117

CAP. III. CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.119

<$$heading>

SYMPLE men of wit moun be edified mych to heuenly lyuyng bi redyng and
knowyng of the olde testament, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.121

for in the bigynnyng of Genesis they moun knowe, hou God made heuen and
erthe and alle creaturis of nou+gt, CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.122

and made man to his owne ymage and licnesse, and to haue blisse in body
and soule with outen ende.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,3.123

Also men moun knowe, hou sore God punishide Adam and Eue for brekyng
of his comaundement; and hou Abel plesid God by feith, mekenesse and
charite; and hou Caym displeside hym by synnes, and specialli by enuye ,
hatrede and manquellyng.  Also hou Noe was loued of God, and al the world,
outaken viij. persones, was distried for synne; and hou for pride
and other synnes God departid many langagis, that no man vndirstood other
in the tour of Babel; and hou feithful and obedient to God Abraham was,
that he +gede out of his lond in to a straunge cuntre, and was redy to
sle his owne sone Isaac at the wille of God, and gat therfore mich reward
of God; and hou God distried Sodom and Gommor, and other thre cytees,
for leccherye and <P_I,4> other synnes, that tho weren sunkun doun;
and the dede see is now where tho grete cytees weren.  Also hou trewe
and obedient to God weren Isaac and Jacob and Joseph, and hou God kepte
hem in alle perels.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.124

Al this proces of Genesis shulde stire cristen men to be feithful,
and for to drede and loue God, and in alle thingis do his wille.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.125

Also in Exodi men moun knowe, hou God kept his simple peple in Egipt , and
encresside hem gretly in that lond, vndir the persecucioun and tirauntrie
of Farao, and deliueride hem by many miraclis, and punishid Farao and his
peple with ten stronge veniauncis, and fedde hem meruelously in desert
xl. +geris, where no duelling of men was bifore, and made hem to
ouercome the strong peple of Amalech.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.126

Aftir this God tau+gte hem wyis gouernayle, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.127

and bitook to hem the ten comaundementis and other iudicials, to punishe
gretly opyn grete synnes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.128

Also they weren ful bisy to make a costlew tabernacle to the onour of
God, by his bidding and techyng, that figuride holi chirche and vertues
in mennes soulis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.129

At the laste God took gret veniaunce on hem for idolatrie, whanne thei
forsoken the feith and worshipyng of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.130

and onoureden +goten calues bi stiryng of the deuel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.131

And thanne Moyses was a trewe mediatour bitwix God and the sinful peple
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.132

and seide thus to God, for gret trist of his mercy and ri+gtfulnes, and
for gret charite to the peple,"either for+giue thou this trespas to hem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.133

either do me out of thi book in which thou hast writen me;"
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.134

and for this deuout preier and greet charite of Moyses God sparede the
synful pepil, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.135

and distryede not sodeynly al the pepil, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.136

but took hem to mercy and grace.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.137

And this proces of Exodi shulde make men trysty in Goddis help, and
to be trewe in his loue, and eschewe his offence with al her my+gtis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.138

The iij. book clepid Leuitici techith men sacrificis due to God,
and for synnes of the peple, in the tyme of the olde testament, and
that no man vnworthi shulde ney+ge to the seruise and sacrifice of God.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.139

These sacrificis owen not to be kept now, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.140

for tho figureden the passioun and deth of Crist, and remissioun
of synnes bi the blood and merit of Crist, in the lawe of grace.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.141

Also this book techith men to absteyne fro wedlok of ny+g kyn and affynyte
, with ynne the ij. degre, CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.142

and ordeyneth peyne of deeth for ydolatrie, and weddyng with ynne the
ij. degre of consanguynyte and affynite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.143

At the last this book techith men to kepe Goddis heestis, and for to loue
her nei+gboris and to do equyte to hem, and werkis of mercy to nedy men;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.144

and comaundith iust wey+gtis and mesures, and domes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.145

and forbedith strongly ydolatrye and wicche craftis and false coniouryngis
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.146

and tellith prosperite that shal come to hem that kepen Goddis
heestis, and veniaunce and peyne to hem that breken Goddis heestis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.147

And this proces of Leuitici shulde make cristen men aferd to breke Goddis
heestis, and ioyful to kepe tho to lyf and deth, for reward of God in
euerlastyng blisse.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.148

The iiij. book clepid Numeri tellith the noumbre of peple led out
of Egipt, bothe of lewid men and of prestis and of dekenys; and how God
kept hem longe in the orrible desert, and punisshide hem alle bi deeth,
out taken Caleph and Josue, for grucchyng and mystriste to Goddis word,
and punisshide Marie, Moyses sistyr, with lepre, for bacbytyng of Moyses,
the mylde seruaunt of God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.149

Also whanne God wolde haue distryed the peple for grucchyng a+gens hym,
Moyses preyede with al his herte for the peple that wolde stoone hym
to deeth.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.150

Also God techith there, that he that doth ony synne by pride shal be
deed, and that he that brak the sabot, +ghe by gaderyng of stickis,
shulde be stooned of alle the peple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.151

Also God punisshide soore Chore, Dathan, and Abyron, that weren rebel
a+gens Moyses and Aaron, and made discencioun in the peple, so that the
erthe openyde, and deuouride hem with here tabernaclis, and al her catel,
and thei +geden doun quyke in to helle.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,4.152

+Git whanne the <P_I,5> peple grucchide a+geyns Moyses and Aaron, and
wolde sle hem vniustly, and God killide mony thousendis of the peple
herfore, Moyses bad Aaron preye, and offre encense for the peple;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.153

and so he ceesside the veniaunce.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.154

Also God techith there, that prestis shulen haue the firste fruytis and
the first boren thingis, and part of sacrificis and avowis and offringis
; and dekenys shulen haue tithis of the peple, and +giue her tithis,
that is, the tenthe part of tithis whiche thei token of the peple, to
the hi+gest prest, and prestis and dekenys shulen holde hem apayed with
her spiritual part of tithis and offryngis, and take no possessioun in
the lond of her britheren, CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.155

for God hymself shal be the part and eritage of prestis, in the myddys
of the sones of Israel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.156

Also for Moyses and Aaron bileueden not fully to Goddis word, but doutiden
of his byheest at the water of a+genseying, God suffride not hem for to
entre in to the lond of byheest, CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.157

but bothe weren deed in desert.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.158

Also in this book ben told the duellyngis of the children of Israel in
desert, and the batels whiche thei hadden a+geyns hethen men; and of
Balaam hou he was huyrid to curse Goddis peple, and hou God compellyd hym
to blesse his peple, and to seye profesie of Crist.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.159

And for the peple of Israel dide fornicacioun and idolatrie, God bad
Moyses hange alle the princis a+gens the sunne, that the strong veniaunce
of God were turned awey fro the peple of Israel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.160

And for as myche as Fynees the prest killide a duke of Israel, that
dide fornicacioun with an hethen womman, and dide this for feruent
loue to God, he gat of God euerlastyng presthod for hym and his seed,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.161

and turned awey Goddis wraththe fro the children of Israel.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.162

Also there is tau+gt, who shal be eyr of a man; and of halydayes,
and sacrificis, and offryngis maade in tho; and whiche avowis shulen
be holden, and whiche not; and of batels; and hou the preyes shulden
be departid among the peple, and what shulde falle to the prest; and
hou the lond of byheest shulde be departid to xij. lynagis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.163

and dekenys shulden haue citees to enhabite in tho, and the subarbees
to here sheep and beestys; CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.164

and citees of refuyt shulden be ordeyned for hem that shedden
blood vnwilfully, not of purpos, neithir hatrede byfore goynge;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.165

and he that is gilty of mannis deeth shal be slayn with outen ony
redempcioun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.166

This proces of Numeri shulde stire cristen men for to loue here enemyes ,
and do good to hem, as Moyses and Aaron diden, and to kepe Goddis heestis,
and shede not mannis blood vniustly.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.167

The fyfthe book clepid Deutronomye is a rehersyng and confermyng of al
the lawe biforegoyng, CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.168

and styrith men gretly to kepe and teche Goddis heestis, and adde no
thing to tho, neither drawe awey ony thing fro tho; CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.169

and first it techith, that wise men and my+gty shulen be maad iugis
, and deme iustly the pore and the riche; aftirward hou the Jewis
ouercamen Seon, the kyng of Hesebon, and token his lond and alle the
goodis therynne in to her owne possessioun, and dedyn in lyk maner to
Og the kyng of Basan, and to his lond and goodis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.170

Ferthermore God comaundith men to kepe hise heestis, and adde no thing
therto, neither drawe ony thing ther fro, and that they drede and loue
God of al her herte, and al her soule, and al her strengthe, and eschewe

heestis to here sones, and thenke on tho heestis in hous and weye,
slepynge and wakynge.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.171

Also God comaundith his peple to eschewe weddyngis of hethen men
and wymmen to her children, lest they ben drawen to idolatrye,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.172

and bihetith many blessyngis to hem and miche encresyng of goodis,
if thei kepen treuly hise comaundementis, and that strong veniaunce
and distryyng shal come on the Jewis, if thei doen ydolatrie, and ben
vnobedient to God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.173

Also God biddith hem haue mynde, that they weldiden the lond of byheest
, not for her owne ri+gtfulnesse and strengthe, but for the synnes of
men that duelliden therynne, and for the ooth of God which he made to
Abraham and to other hooly men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,5.174

And thanne God remembrith to hem many grete synnis, to make hem war that
thei trespase no more, but that thei drede God <P_I,6> and loue hym in
alle her hert and soule, kepe hise comaundementis, and swere by his name,
and loue pilgrymes either comelyngis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.175

Eft God biddith hem haue hise wordis in her hertis and wittis, and
haue tho for a singne in the hondis, and bytwyxe her y+gen, and that
they teche her sones to bithenke on the wordis of God euere, and that
they write the wordis of God on the postis and +gatis of her hous; and
tellith and +giueth his blessyng to hem, if thei kepen hise heestis,
and +giueth his curs to hem, if they breken hise heestis, and worshipen
aliene goddis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.176

Also they shulen distrye the placis wherynne hethen men diden ydolatrie,
and distrye her auters, ymagis, woodis and ydols; CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.177

and thei shulen make her sacrifices, and offre her tithis, and the firste
fruytis, and +giftis and avowis in the place which the Lord hath chose
to his name, CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.178

and this was the temple of Jerusalem.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.179

Also a prophete, either a feynere of dremys, that wole styre men to
do ydolatrye shal be slayn, and so shal a frend either citee that doth
idolatrye, eithir styrith other men therto.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.180

Also thou shalt paye tithis of alle fruytis that growen in erthe, of
whete, of wyn, and of oyle, and the first boren thingis of neet and
sheep; CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.181

and in the thridde +gere thou shalt departe an othir tithe of alle thingis
that growen to thee, and kepe it with ynne thine +gatis, to susteyne
the dekene, pylgrym outher comelyng, fadirles child either modirles,

Also in the vij. +geer shal be remissioun of dette to citeseynes
and kynnesmen, netheles not to a pylgrym and comelyng, CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.183

for he may be compellid to paye.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.184

Outirly a nedy man and begger shal not be among Goddis peple;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.185

but pore men shulen not fayle in the lond, CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.186

therfore ryche men shulen helpe hem with loue, and helpe hem wilfully
in here nede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.187

Thanne God techith of thre grete solempnetees, of pask, of the feeste
of woukis either pentecost, and of the feeste of tabernaclis; and that
maystris and iugis shulen be ordeyned in alle +gatis either citees by
ech lynage, to deme the peple by iust doom, and take not +giftis nether
persones.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.188

Ferthermore God techith, that who euer is conuyct by tweyne eithir thre
witnessis, that he hath do idolatrie, he shal be stoonyd, first by the
witnessis, and thanne by al the pepil.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.189

He that is proud and wole not obeye to the comaundement of the hi+ge
prest , and to the doom of the iugis, in that that thei techen Goddis
lawe, shal be deed.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.190

Thanne God techith, what maner kyng the pepil shal make, and what shal
be his office.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.191

Aftirward God techith, that prestis and dekenys, and alle that ben of
the same lynage, shulen not haue part and eritage with the residue pepil
of Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.192

for they shulen ete the sacrifices of the Lord, and the offringis of hym,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.193

and thei shulen take noon othir thing of the possessioun of her bretheren
; for whi God hym self is her eritage.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.194

Ferthermore God forbedith idolatrie, and to enquere coniourers, and to
kepe dremys and chiteryng of briddis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.195

and comaundith that no wicche neithir enchaunter be, and that men take
not councel at hem that han spiritis in cloos, neithir at false dyuynours,
neithir axe of deede men the trouthe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.196

Also God shal reise a profete of her brethir, that is Crist the Sauyour
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.197

and he that hath not hise wordis shal be punishid.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.198

A profete that wole speke by pride in the name of God that thing that
God bad not hym, eithir bi the name of othir goddis, shal be slayn.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.199

Also vj. citees of refuyt eithir of fraunchise shulen be, that
he that sleeth a man, not by hatrede but a+gens his wille, be saued,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.200

and he that sleeth a man bi hatrede and bifore castyng, shal be slayn
with oute mercy, eithir raunsoun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.201

He that is conuict to have seid fals witnessyng a+gens his brothir,
shal haue the same peyne to which his brothir shulde be put, if he hadde
be gilty.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.202

Also prestis shulen coumforte hem that gon to iust batel, to haue trist

han newly byldyd an hous, eithir newly plauntid a vyne, eithir newly
weddid a wyf, and not vsid hir, go not to batel; CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.203

and first werryours shulen profre pees to a citee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,6.204

and if the citee +gelde it self, men ther <P_I,7> ynne shulen lyue vndir

ellis alle men ther ynne shulen be slayn; CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.206

and this is vndirstonden of tho citees that be not +gouen in to

And there is teld the departyng of preyes, and what trees shulen be kit
doun in bisegynge.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.208

Also God techith what shal be doon, whanne a man is founden slayn,
and the sleer is vnknowun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.209

A child rebel to the fadir and modir, and that +giueth hym silf to
glotenye, leccherye and drunkennesse, shal be stoonyd of al the citee.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.210

A man shal kepe the oxe and sheep of his brothir, that is strayed awey,
and bringe it a+gen to his brothir, and so of other beestis and of ech

and if thou knowist not, whose tho ben, thou shalt kepe tho stille,
tyl thi brothir seke and resseyue tho.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.212

Who euer doth avoutrie, shal be deed; CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.213

if a man defoulith a virgyne, he shal wedde hir, and +giue l.
siclis of siluer to her fadir.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.214

Thou shalt not take a seruaunt to his lord, which seruaunt fledde to
thee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.215

bot he shal duelle with thee in a place that plesith hym.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.216

Noon hoore shal be of the dou+gtris of Israel, neithir a lechour of the
soones of Israel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.217

Thou shalt not leene to thi brothir for vsure.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.218

If a man hatith his wife, he shal write and +giue to hir a libel of

but this is forbedun of Crist in the gospel of M=t=.v=to=.  ca=o=.
and xix ca=o=.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.220

Whanne a man hath take late a wyf, he shal not go to batel,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.221

neithir ony comyn office shal be put on hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.222

but oon +geer he shal be glad with his wif, and take heede to his hous.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.223

He that proloyneth his brothir, which is a fre man, and sillith hym,
shal be slayn.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.224

Thou shalt +gelde at ny+gt to a pore man his weed, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.225

and in the same day thou shalt paye to a nedy traueylour his huyre.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.226

Fadris shulen not be slayn for the sones, neithir sones for the fadris.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.227

Whanne thou repist corn in the feeld, and for+getist an handful, thou
shalt not turne a+gen to take it, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.228

but thou shalt suffre that a comelyng, fadirles child and wydewe
take it awey; and so of gaderyng of olyues and of gaderyng of grapis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.229

Whanne twey men ben at debatyng, and the wif of oon wole delyuere hir
housbond fro the hond of the strenger, and take hym by the preuy membris ,
sche shall leese her hond withouten eny mercy.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.230

And there God forbedith false wei+gtis and mesures, a more and a lesse.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.231

Also dekenes schulen pronunce and seie with hi+g vois to alle the men of
Israel, he is cursid that doth ydolatrie, eithir brekith eny comaundement

and al the peple schal seie, Amen.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.233

Also God biheetith greet prosperite to his peple, if thei kepe his

and thei schulen be blessid in citee and in feeld, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.235

CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.239

and if thei kepen not Goddis heestis, thei schulen be cursid in cite
and feeld, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.240

the fruit of her wombe, and alle thingis that perteynen to hem schul be

God schal sende hem hungir, thirst, pestilence, feuer and coold
, brennynge and heete, and corupt eir, til thei perischen;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.242

enemyes schulen haue victorie, and conquere hem, and take hem presoners
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.243

and +git God schal punysche hem with huge veniaunce, that alle that

Natheles if whanne alle these veniances ben fallen on hem, thei repenten

in al her herte and al her soule, the Lord shal haue mercy on hem, and
bringe hem a+gen to hire lond fro alle folkis, among whiche thei weren
scaterid, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.245

and God schal blesse hem, and make hem to be of more noumbre than {of}
her fadris weren, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.246

and schal turne alle the cursis on her enemyes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.247

and God schal +geue to hem aboundaunce in alle werkis of her hondis,
and in alle thingis that perteynen to hem.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.248

Moises spac alle these wordis to al the puple of Israel,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.249

and bad hem drede not her enemyes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.250

for God schal go bifore his peple, and ouercome her enemyes.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,7.251

And Moises ordeyned Josue to be ledere of the peple bifore al the
multitude of the sones <P_I,8> of Israel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.252

Moises wroot this lawe CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.253

and +gaf it to prestis, the sones of Leuy, and to the eldre men of Israel,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.254

and bad hem rede the wordis of this lawe bifore al Israel, in the heeringe

to the feith of Jewis, that thei heere and lerne and dreede oure Lord God,
and kepe and fille alle the wordis of this lawe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.255

Moises bi Goddis comaundement wroot a greet song, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.256

and tau+gte it the children of Israel, that it schulde be into witnessing
a+gens hem; CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.257

and Moises clepide togidere alle the eldre men and techeris,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.258

and clepide heuene and erthe into witnessing a+gens hem;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.259

and whanne Moises hadde fillid alle the wordis of this greet song,
he styede into an hil, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.260

and was deed there, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.261

and God biryede him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.262

and man knew not his sepulcre til into this day.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.263

Cristen men schulde myche reede and heere and kunne this book of

CAP. IV. CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.266

<$$heading>

The vj. book, which is clepid Josue, tellith in general, that
Josue brou+gte the peple into the lond of biheeste, and departide it
bi lott to hem; and first how God bihi+gte to Josue that noon schulde
mowe a+genstonde him and his peple in alle the daies of his lijf;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.268

and God bihi+gte that Josue schulde departe bi lot to his peple the lond
of biheest; CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.269

and God comaundide him to kepe al the lawe, and bowe not fro it, but
thenke therinne bi daies and ny+gtis, that he kepe and do tho thingis
that ben writen therinne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.270

Aftir this Josue sente aspies to bihoolde the lond and the citee of
Jerico; CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.271

and thei entriden in to the hous of a comun womman Raab,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.272

and weren sauid there bi counceil and helpe of the womman.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.273

Thanne Josue bad the prestis take the arke of boond of pees of the Lord,
and goo bifore the peple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.274

and thei diden so.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.275

And whanne the prestis camen with the arke to the brinke of Jurdan,
the greet watir of Jurdan wente awey to the deed se, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.276

and the hi+gere wateris stooden stille as a wal, so that the peple
passide bi the drie botme, and the prestis stoodin on the drie erthe in
the myddis of Jurdan.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.277

Also Josue bad xij. men of xij. lynagis of Israel take
xij. greete stoonis fro the botme of Jordan, and sette tho in
Galgalis, where the peple settide tentis in the ny+gt aftir the passage
of Jurdan, and take xij. stoonis of the lond, and putte in the
myddis of Jordan, where the arke hadde stoonde; CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.278

and bad that fadris schulden teche hire children, hou thei passiden bi
the drie botme of Jurdan, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.279

for God driede the watris theroffe, as he hadde do before in the reed
se, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.280

and the prestis and princis and al the peple obeyede to Josue.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.281

Thanne Josue circumcide the peple that was vncircumcidid xl.
+geer in desert, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.282

and the peple made paask in the xiiij. day of the monthe at
euentid; CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.283

and Josue si+g an aungel of the Lord, which aungel was prince of Goddis
oost.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.284

Also the stronge wallis of Jerico felden doun at Goddis ordynaunce,
whanne the prestis brayeden with vij. trumpis, and alle the
peple criede an hi+g in the vij. day of cumpassing of the citee.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.285

And the peple of Israel distroiede and brente the citee and alle thingis
therinne, outaken Raab and tho that weren in her hous, and outtaken gold
and syluer, and vessels of bras and yroun, whiche thei haleweden in to
the tresorie of the Lord.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.286

Also for Achar dide a+gens Goddis bidding, and took to himself a thing
reserued to Goddis vs, he was stoonid and brent, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.287

and alle hise goodis weren brent with hym; CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.288

and til this punysching was doon on hym, the peple of Israel my+gte not
stoonde, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.289

but was ouercomen of hire enemyes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.290

After this punysching of Achar Josue took the citee of Hay,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.291

and killede the king and al the peple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.292

and distroiede and brente the citee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.293

and hangide the king therof in a iebat.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.294

Thanne Josue bildide an auter to God in the hill of Hebal,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.295

and offride theronne brent sacrifice and peesible sacrificis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,8.296

and wroot the Deutronomye of Moyses lawe on <P_I,9> stoonis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.297

And first he blesside the peple of Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.298

and aftir these thingis he redde alle the wordis of blessing and
of cursing, and alle thingis that weren writen in the book of lawe;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.299

he lefte noo thing vntouchid of these thingis whiche Moises hadde
comaundid, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.300

but he declaride alle thingis bifore al the multitude of Israel, to
wymmen and litel children, and to comelyngis that dwelliden among hem.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.301

Also men of Gabaon feyneden hem to be of fer cuntre, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.302

and bi this fraude thei gaten of Josue and other princis pees and lijf;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.303

and for this fraude thei and alle hire successouris weren maad boonde
, to bringe woode and watir to the seruise of the auter and of al the
multitude of Israel for euere.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.304

Also Josue by Goddis help ouercam v. greete kingis in oo day,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.305

and made hise princis trede on the neckis of these kingis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.306

and aftirward hangide these kingis in v. iebatis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.307

and he ouercam alle the kingis and her peplis that dwelliden in the lond
of biheest, that weren xxxj. kingis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.308

and departide the lond of biheest to xij. lynagis of Israel bi lot,
and citees of refuyt, and citees to prestis and dekenes to dwelle inne,
as God comaundide.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.309

This processe of Josue schulde stire cristene men to haue greet trist
in God, and dreede noo man neither peple, as longe as thei seruen treuly
Almy+gty God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.310

The vij. book clepid Judicum tellith that the puple of Israel
was reulid with iugis, either domysmen, aftir the deeth of Josue, and
sumtyme bi a womman Delbora.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.311

Whanne the peple felde to greete synnes, and specialy to ydolatrie
, God sente aduersaries on hem that turmentiden the Jewis ful sore,
and killide many thousendis of hem, and heeld othere vndir tribute and
greet thraldam.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.312

And whanne the peple repentide vereily, and criede to God with al her
herte, he sente help to hem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.313

and reiside a iuge that ouercam her enemyes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.314

and reulide hem wel in pees and in Goddis lawe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.315

This prosces of Judicum schulde stire cristene men for to flee synne,
and loue God that doith so greet mercy to hem that repentyn verili.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.316

This book comprehendith the storie of Ruth, that was an hethene womman,
and lefte her nacoun, and ydolatrie, and bileeuede in God, and kepte
his lawe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.317

Therfore sche was weddid to a noble man of the Jewis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.318

and is set in the genelogie either kynrede of oure Sauyour.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.319

This story schulde stire alle men to forsake her synne, and serue God
treuly in al hire lijf, for reward of heuenly blisse.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.320

The first book of Kingis tellith, how the prest Ely and his sones
weren repreued and slayn, for thei gouerneden yuele Goddis peple,
and for her synne and necligence the peple dide myche synne, and was
ouercomen of hethene men, and the arke of God was taken of hethene men,
and thei killeden manye thousindis of the Jewis; and how the trewe chijld
Samuel was a feithful prophete of the Lord, and gouernede wel the peple
in Goddis seruise and ri+gtfulnesse, and dide noon extorcioun, neither
took +giftis of eny man, neither coueitide eny mannis good, but dide
alle thingis in his offis iustly bifore God and man.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.321

And whanne Samuel was eeld, he settide his sones iuges of Israel;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.322

and for thei bowide aftir auarice, and tooken +giftis, and peruertiden
doom, the peple axiden a king on hem, to greet indignacoun of God and
harm of hemself.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.323

Thanne Saul that was pore and meke, and sou+gte the assis of his fadir,
was maad king, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.324

and dide wel a lytel while, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.325

and aftirward for his pride and coueitise he was repreued of God, and
pryued fro the reume, bothe he and his kyn; CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.326

and pore Dauith was chosen king bi Goddis ordynaunce for his meeknesse,
mersy, and charite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.327

Dauith sparyde Saul his enemye, that pursuede him to deeth vniustly,
and was a traitour and blasfemere of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.328

and not oonly sparide him twyes bitaken in to his hoondis, whanne he
my+gte haue slayn him, and +git ascapide harmles, CMPURVEY-M3,I,9.329

but also lettide hise men to smyte hym, whanne thei my+gten haue slayn

And +git the wickid tyraunt Saul pursuede him for enuye,

and +geldide peyne to Saul for his tyrauntrie and wickidnesse,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.335

and made him to be slayn of hethene men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.336

This processe of the firste book of Kingis schulde stire prestis to be
not necligent in her offis, neither to be coueytous, and styre seculer

The ij. book of Kingis tellith first, hou Dauith biweylide greetly

and Dauith killede the man of Amalech that killede Saul outirly, aftir
the deeth wounde of Saul, and brou+gte to Dauith the coroune and bye

and thanne was longe werre bytwixxe Hisboseth, sone of Saul, and bitwixe

Also Dauith killide Baana and Rechab, that killeden bi treesoun Hisboseth

Aftir this the noble king Dauith hadde twyes victorie of Filisteis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.355

Thanne Dauith took xxx. thousind chosen men of Israel to

CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.359

therfore Dauith thougte to bylde an hous to the ark of God.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.360

Thanne God telde to Dauith that his sone schulde bylde this hous,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.361

and the trone of the reume of Dauith schal be stable withouten ende;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.362

and this is fillid in Crist.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.363

Thanne Dauith hadde victorie of many londis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.364

and made tho tributarie to Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.365

and God kepte Dauith in alle thingis, to whiche he +ged forth.

and he took meekly his repreuyng, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.373

and knoulechide that he synnede a+gens God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.374

and God for+gaf the synne, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.375

but swerd and persecusioun +gede neuere awey fro his hous,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.376

for God killede the sone of Bersabee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.377

and oo sone of Dauith killede another, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.378

and Absolon his sone roos a+gens him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.379

and droof him out of Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.380

and sou+gte with stronge oost to slee him.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.381

Thanne Dauith +gede out of Jerusalem on his feet, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.382

and sti+gide with bare feet into the hi+gnesse of the hille of Olyuete,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.383

and wepte, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.384

and al his peple wepte bittirly.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.385

And Dauith mekede him to God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.386

and seide,"+gif God seith to me, thou pleesist not me, I am redy,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.387

do he that that is good bifore himself. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.388

Thanne Semey, that was of the kyn of Saul, dispiside Dauith,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.389

and clepide him a manquellere, and a man of Belial, and a rauenour of
the rewme, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.390

and he curside Dauith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.391

and castide stoonis and erthe a+gens Dauith, and a+gens alle the
seruauntis of king Dauith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.392

and whanne Abisay wolde slee this cursere, Dauith bad him suffre Semey
to curse him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.393

and seide, God comaundide hym that he curse Dauith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.394

And the kyng seide to Abysay and to alle his seruauntis,"Loo!  my sone

suffre +ge him to curse bi comaundement of the Lord; if in caas the
Lord bihoolde my turment, and +gelde good to me for this cursing to day.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.397

Aftirward Absolon defoulide opynly his fadris wijfes bifore al Ysrael.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.398

Thanne Achitofel +gaf a fel counceyl, to pursue Dauith in that ny+gt
with xij. thousandis of men, and sle him bifore that he were war;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,10.399

but this counceil was <P_I,11> distroied bi Goddis wille, and bi a wijs
conuceil of Chusy, the frend of Dauith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.400

Thanne Absolon gaderide al the power of Israel to make opyn werre a+gens

natheles Dauith for pite and charite comaundide thre princis of his
oost to kepe Absolon alyue, that he my+gte repente, and be sauid.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.402

And whanne Dauith knew that Absolon was slayn, he made so gret sorewe,
that almest he was deed, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.403

and al the peple was in poynt to forsake Dauith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.404

Thanne for this perel Dauith lefte his moornyng, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.405

and sat opinly in the +gate, to conforte al his oost.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.406

After this the counceil of al Israel cam to Dauith, that thei wolde
brynge him in to his rewme worschipfully; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.407

and Dauith for+gaf the opyn tresoun to hem that thei hadden do bifore,

and stiride swetly, men of Juda, that weren specialy his traytouris,

and he for+gaf the souereyn tresoun to Amasa, that was of his owne kyn,
and was prince of the oost of Absalon to slee Dauith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.411

and Dauith swor to make this Amasa prince next Joab, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.412

and for+gaf the synne and cursing and tresoun to Semey,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.413

and swor that he shulde not dy+ge.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.414

+Git bifore that Dauith cam to Jerusalem, a new debate roos bitwixe the
men of Israel and the men of Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.415

for this bringing a+gen of the king was not teld first to men of Israel
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.416

and bi stiring of Syba, a man of Belial, that was of kyn of Saul, al
Israel was departid fro Dauith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.417

and suede this Syba; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.418

and in this tyme Joab killyde bi tresoun the noble kny+gt Amasa.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.419

Thanne this Syba passide bi alle the lynagis of Israel til into Habela,
and into Bethmaka, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.420

and alle chosen men weren gaderid to him.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.421

And Joab and his oost bysegeden these citees, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.422

and wolde distroie the greet citee Habela, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.423

and a wijs woman of the citee sauid it bi hire counceil,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.424

and made Syba to be slayn, and al the peple to be sauid on bothe sydis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.425

Also vij. men of the kyn of Saul weren slayn of Gabaonytis,
bi suffring of Dauith, and bi counceil of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.426

for Saul killede wickidly the men of Gabaon; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.427

and for this synne of Saul hungir was maad thre +geer in the daies of
Dauith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.428

and aftir this veniaunce don on the hous of Saul, God dide mersy to

Thanne is set a greet song of Dauith, which he spac to God, whanne he
hadde delyuered him fro the hond of alle his enemyes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.430

thanne sueth the noumbre of stronge men of Dauith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.431

At the laste Dauith for pride and a+gens the lawe noumbride the peple

and therfore lxx. thousind of men weren deed bi pestilence.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.433

Thanne Dauith repentide him sore, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.434

I biseche that thin hond be turnid a+gens me, and a+gens the hous of my

Thanne God sente his profete Gad to hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.440

and bad him make an auter, and offre brent sacrifices and peesible

The prosces of this ij. book ou+gte to stire kingis and lordis to

CAP. V. CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.446

<$$heading>

The thridde book of Kingis tellith first, how Adonyas, sone of Dauith ,
wolde haue, regned, and Dauith in his lijf ordeynede Salomon to be king,
and he regnede bifore the deeth of Dauith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.448

Thanne Adonyas fledde for dreede to the tabernacle of God,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,11.449

and heeld <P_I,12> the corneer of the auter, tyl Salamon seide, that if
he were a good man, he schulde not dye; CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.450

ellis, if yuel were founden in him, he schulde di+ge.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.451

Thanne Dauith, in the tyme of his dy+ginge, chargide Salamon to kepe
wel Goddis lawe, and to quyte to the sones of Bersellay the trewthe
and kyndnesse of her fadir, and to punysche Joab for his trecherouse
manquelling of Abner and of Amasa in the tyme of pees, and to punysche
wisely Semey for his wrste {COM:sic} cursing, which he dide to Dauith.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.452

Aftir these thingis Salamon made Adonyas to be slayn, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.453

for he purposide gilefully to be king.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.454

And Salamon castide awey Abiathar, that he was not the prest of the Lord,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.455

and exylide him also, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.456

for he assentide to Adonyas, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.457

and was traytour to the king.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.458

Also Salamon comaundide Joab to be slayn in the taber-nacle at the auter
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.459

for he hadde slayn gilefully twey princis in pees, withoute wyting of
Dauith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.460

and the king ordeynede Sadoch prest for Abiathar.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.461

Thanne the king comaundide Semey, that he schulde not go out of Jerusalem
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.462

and if he passide the stronde of Cedron, he schulde be deed;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.463

and Semey acceptide this; CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.464

and for he passide these boundis, the king comaundide him to be slayn,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.465

and so he was slayn by comaundement of the king.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.466

Aftir these thingis the rewme was confermed in to the hondis of Salamon
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.467

and he weddide the dou+gter of Faroo, king of Egipt.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.468

Thanne God bad Salamon axe of him, what hym lykide, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.469

and he axide that God schulde +geue to him wijs herte, that he my+gte deme
his peple, and make discrescyoun eithir departyng bitwixe good and yuel.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.470

And this axing pleeside God ful myche, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.471

therfore God +gaf to him a wijs herte and vndirstondinge, in so
myche that noon bifore hym was lyk hym, neithir schal rise aftir hym.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.472

Also God +gaf to him richesse and glorie, that noon among kingis was
lyk him in alle daies bifore.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.473

Thanne for Salamon +gaf a wijs sentense of dom bitwixe twey comen
wymmen, that passide the wit of comun men, thei dredden the king,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.474

and seyin that Goddis wisdom was in him to make dom.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.475

Thanne is toold the worschipeful meyne and houshoold of Salamon.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.476

Aftir these thingis Salamon bildide a noble hous to himself, and a
famouse temple to God in Jerusalem.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.477

And aftir that the temple was fully maad, alle the eldre men and princis
of lynagis and dukis of meynes of the children of Israel weren gaderid
to king Salamon in Jerusalem, to bringe the arke of God fro Syon in to
his owne place in the temple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.478

Thanne the king axide of God manye preieris, and profitis for hem that
preieden deuoutly in the temple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.479

and God grauntide tho.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.480

Aftir these thingis God halewide the temple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.481

and certyfiede to Salamon, that if he kepte alle his comaundementis,
he shulde sette the trone of Salamons rewme on Israel withouten ende;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.482

and if the pepel of Israel and her children kepen not Goddis heestis,
but worschipen alyen goddis, he schal do awey Israel fro the face of
lond which he +gaf to hem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.483

and God schal caste awey fro his si+gt the temple which he halewide to
his name, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.484

and Israel schal be into a prouerbe and fable either tale to alle peplis
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.485

and this hous schal be into ensaumple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.486

Aftir this the qwene of Saba cam to Salamon, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.487

and hadde greet aray of men and of jewelis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.488

and +gaf manye jewelis to Salamon, and he a+geen to hire.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.489

Also Salamon tau+gte hire alle thingis that sche hadde in hire herte,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.490

and sche blessid God and Salamon and his seruauntis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.491

and +gede into hire lond.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.492

Thanne Salamon made manye scheeldis and bokelers of gold,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.493

and made a greet trone of yuer, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.494

and clothide it with fyn gold.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.495

Thanne king Salamon was magnified ouer alle kyngis of erthe in richessis
and wisedom, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.496

and al erthe desyride to see his face, and to heere his wisdom, which
his God hadde +goue in his herte.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.497

Aftir alle these thingis Salamon, whanne he was eeld, louede gretly
manye hethene wymmen, CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.498

and hadde a thousind wijues, principal and secundaries,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.499

and thanne his herte was bischrewid and peruertid bi tho wymmen, that
he suede alyen goddis, and worschipide hem.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.500

Therfore God reiside an aduersarie to Salamon in his lijf,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,12.501

and departide <P_I,13> his rewme in the tyme of Roboam his sone,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.502

and +gaf ten lynagis to Joroboam his seruaunt, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.503

and kepte oo lynage to his sone for the merit of Dauith his fadir.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.504

And this departyng bifelde myche, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.505

for Roboam forsook the counceil of eelde and wijse men,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.506

and suede the counceil of +gunge men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.507

and spac harde wordis to the peple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.508

Thanne Roboam gaderide proudly al the hous of Juda, and the lynage of
Beniamyn, an c. thousind and iiij. score thousind of
chosen men and werrouris, that thei schulden fi+gte a+gens the hous
of Israel, and bringe a+gen the rewme to Roboam, the sone of Salamon;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.509

but God forbed this werre to Roboam and al his peple, for whi this word
of departyng of the rewme was don of God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.510

Thanne Jeroboam made ij. golden caluys, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.511

and bad Israel worschipe tho, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.512

and sti+ge no more to Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.513

and seide,"Israel, lo!  these ben thi goddis, that ledden thee out of
the lond of Egipt;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.514

and he made vnworthi prestis of the laste men of the peple, that were
not of the sones of Leuy, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.515

and he made templis in hi+ge placis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.516

Also whanne Jeroboam stood on the auter and castide encense, a man of
God cam fro Juda bi the word of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.517

and seide,"A sone, Josias bi name, schal be born to the hous of Dauith,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.518

and he schal sle on this auter the prestis of hi+ge placis, that brenne
now encense in this autir, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.519

and he schal brenne boonys of men on this auter;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.520

and the prophete +gaf this singne, that the auter schal be cleft, and
the asche therinne schal be sched out.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.521

Thanne Jeroboam heeld forth his hond, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.522

and bad take that prophete, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.523

and his hond was drie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.524

and hee my+gte not drawe it a+gen, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.525

and bi preier of the prophete the hond was heelid.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.526

And singne bifelde on the auter, as the prophete seide;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.527

and for that prophete eet breed in that place a+gens Goddis bidding,
+ghe bi disseit of a fals prophete, the trewe prophete of God was slayn
of a lyoun in the wey homward.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.528

Aftir these wordis Jeroboam turnede not a+gen fro his worste weie,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.529

but a+genward of the laste peples he made prestis of hi+ge placis,
who euere wolde, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.530

fyllede his hond, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.531

and was maad prest of hi+ge placis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.532

and for this cause the hous of Jeroboam synnede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.533

and was distroied, and doon awey fro the face of erthe.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.534

Aftir this the prophete Ahia, that was blynd for eelde, knew the wijf
of Joroboam, that feynede hire to be anothir womman, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.535

and he bifore seide to hire, that hire syk sone schulde di+ge in hir
entryng in to hir hous, and that the hous of Jeroboam schulde be distroied
outtirly for his synnes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.536

and Israel schal be dryuen out of his good lond for the synnes of Joroboam
, that synnede, and made Israel to do synne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.537

Also the peple of Juda dide ydolatrie; CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.538

therfore the king of Egipt took awey the tresouris of Goddis hous, and of
the kingis hous, and the golden scheeldis of Salamon, for whiche Roboam
made scheeldis of bras.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.539

And batail was bitwixe Roboam and Jeroboam in alle daies.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.540

Thanne Abia regnede thre +geer on Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.541

and +gede in alle the synnes of his fadir.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.542

Aftir him roos king Asa in Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.543

and he dide ri+gtfulnesse bifore God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.544

and dide awey idolatrie and sodomytis fro the lond, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.545

and his herte was perfit with God in alle daies.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.546

And schortly amonge alle the kingis of Israel was noon feithful to God;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.547

summe weren goode amonge the kingis of Juda; CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.548

and this figurith, that among men of hooly chirche be summe goode,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.549

but among eretikis is noon good outtirly, as Jerom seith.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.550

Aftir manye yuele kingis of Israel roos Acab, the worste of alle bifore
hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.551

and he weddide Jesabel, an hethene womman, the dou+gtir of Mechaal,
king of Sydonyes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.552

and Achab dide manyfoold idolatrie.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.553

Thanne roos Elie the prophete, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.554

and seide to Acab, that in thre +geer and an half neither reyn neither
dew schal be.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.555

Aftir this the prophete Elye hidde himself in the stronde of Carith,
a+gens Jordan, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.556

and drank watir, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.557

and was fed of rauenys there, whiche brou+gten to him breed and flesch
in the euentid and morewtid, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.558

and aftir that the stronde was dried up, God bad Elye go into Sarepta
of Sydoneyes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.559

and there he was fed of a widewe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.560

and the pot of mele and the pot of oile fallede not to the widewe,
til God +gaf reyn on the erthe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.561

Thanne Elie reiside to lijf the deed chijld of a womman, at whom he was
myche susteyned.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,13.562

And aftir manye daies God bad Elye schewe him to Acab, that God <P_I,14>
schulde +geue reyn on the lond; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.563

and Elie dide so; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.564

and greet hungir was in Samarie.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.565

Thanne Elie apperide first to Abdie, that dredde God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.566

and fedde an c. prophetis of God, whanne Jesabel killide the
prophetis of God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.567

and Elie swor to Abdie bi the Lord of oostis, that he wolde appere in
that day to Achab.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.568

Thanne Acab axide Elye,"Wher thou art he, that distrowblist Israel?
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.569

And Elie seide,"Not I distrowblide Israel, but thou and the hous of
thi fadir, that han forsaken Goddis heestis, and han sued Balym, han
distroublid Israel. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.570

Aftir this the prophete Elie conuyctid bi an opyn myracle viij.
c. and l. prophetis of Baal of opin ydolatrie,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.571

and killede hem alle with helpe of the peple, that bileeuede to God for
the greet myracle.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.572

And aftir this God sente greet rayn, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.573

and Elye ran bifore Acab to the citee Jesrael.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.574

Aftir these thingis Elye fledde for dreede of Jesabel, that manaside to
slee hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.575

and whanne he hadde fled into disert bi the jurney of oo day, he axide
of God to di+ge; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.576

and whanne he slepte, an aungel bad hym rise, and eete breed baken vndir
aischis, and drinke watir; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.577

and he +gede in the strengthe of that mete xl. daies and xl.
ny+gtis, til to Oreb the hil of God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.578

and whanne he was hid there in a denne, and seide, that he was left
aloone a prophete of the Lord, and thei sou+gten to slei him, God bad
him go to Damask, and anoynte Asahel king on Sirie, and anoynte Hieu king
on Israel, and anoynte Elisee a prophete for him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.579

and these thre schulden do veniaunce on trespasouris, and slee hem;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.580

and God lefte to himself vij. thousind of men in Israel, whois
knees were not bowid bifore Baal.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.581

Thanne it sueth how Elisee suede Elie.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.582

Aftir these thingis king Acab hadde twey greete and merueilous victories
a+gens Benadab, king of Sirie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.583

for he blasfemede God of Israel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.584

And for king Acab dide false mersy and killide not this blasfemere
Benadab, whom God bitook into hise hondis, God sente a prophete to Acab,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.585

and telde thus,"For thou suffredist a man wrthi the deth to go fro thin
hond, thi lijf schal be for his lijf, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.586

and thi peple schal be for his peple. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.587

Aftirward Jesabel the qwene made Nabath to be stonyd to deth bi false
witnesse, and assent of Acab, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.588

for he noolde chaunge neither sille his vyner to the king;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.589

and whanne Acab +gede doun to take possessioun of this vyner, God bad
Elye meete him, and seie thus,"Thou hast slayn CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.590

and hast take possessioun; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.591

the Lord seith these thingis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.592

in this place wherinne doggis lickiden the blood of Nabath, thei schulen
licke also thi blood. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.593

And Acab seide to Elye,"Wher thou hast founden me thin enemy?
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.594

And Elye seide,"I haue founde, for thou art seeld to do yuel in Goddis
si+gt, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.595

therfore God schal distroie and slee ech man of the house of Acab,
and +geue his hous as the hous of Jeroboam, and as the hous of Baasa,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.596

for Acab terride God to wraththe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.597

and made Ysrael to do synne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.598

Also doggis scholen ete Jesabel in the feeld of Jesrael;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.599

if Acab di+geth in the citee, doggis scholen ete him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.600

if he dieth in the feeld, briddis of the eir schulen ete him.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.601

Noon othir was such as Acab, that was seeld to do yuel bifore God;
forwhi Jesabel his wijf excitide him, and he dide abomynable ydolatrie.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.602

Thanne Acab dide ful greet penaunce, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.603

and was mekid bifore God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.604

therfore God brou+gte not yn this yuel in his daies, but in the daies
of his sone.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.605

In the thridde +geer aftir these thingis, aboute iiij. c.
prophetis of Baal conuceiled Acab to make werre a+gens the king of Syrie
for a citee clepid Ramoth of Galaad, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.606

and bihi+gten victorie and prosperite to Acab.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.607

But Mychee, oo prophete of God, telde to Acab in Goddis name, that the
spirit of leesingis disceyuede him bi his false prophetis, and that Acab
schulde be slayn in that bateil; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.608

and so it bifelde in deede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.609

but Mychee was dispisid and beten of the false prophetis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.610

and was prisonyd, purposid to be slayn of the king, whanne he cam a+geen
in pees; CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.611

and king Josophat, a good man, was in this bateile with cursid Acab,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.612

but Acab was slayn, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.613

and doggis lickeden his blood, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.614

and Josophat was sauid bi Goddis help.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.615

Thanne roos Ocosias, king of Israel, for Acab his fadir,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.616

and Ocosias worschipide Baal, CMPURVEY-M3,I,14.617

and terride God to ire bi alle thingis which <P_I,15> his fadir hadde do.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.618

This prosces of the iij. book of Kingis schulde stire kingis
and lordis, to be mersyful and pytouse on her sugetis that trespasen

CAP. VI. CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.621

<$$heading>

The iii.j book of Kingis tellith in general, how the rewme of Israel
and the rewme of Juda weren conquerid of hethene men, for manye synnes
which thei diden a+gens God and men, and weren obstynat, and dide not
fruytfull penance in due tyme.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.623

First it tellith in special, hou the wickid king Ocosyas sente to take
counceil at Belsabub, wher he my+gte lyue, and rekyuere of his syknesse
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.624

therfore God sente Elye, the prophete, to telle to him that he schulde
die, and go not doun of his bed.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.625

Thanne this king sent to Elye a prince on {COM:sic_means_"of"_or_"over"}
l. men, and l. men with hym, to clepe Elye to the king;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.626

and fijer cam doun fro heuene, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.627

and deuouride this prince, and l. men that weren with him,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.628

for in scorn thei clepiden Elye the man of God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.629

and in lyk manere fijer deuouride another prince, and l. men with
him; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.630

the thridde prince and hise l. that mekeden hem to God and to
the prophete, weren sauid on lyue.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.631

And God bad Elie go doun with hem to the king, and repreue him of his
synne, and telle to the king himself, that he schal die and go not doun
of his bed.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.632

Aftir this the prophete Elie schulde be rauyschid awey fro erthe,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.633

and Elisee knew this, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.634

and suede him in ech place til to rauysching; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.635

and Elie smoot with his mantel the watris of Jordon, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.636

and tho weren departid therbi, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.637

and Elie and Elysee +geden ouere bi the drie botme therof.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.638

Thanne Elie was rauyschid in a char of fijer fro Elisee,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.639

and sti+gede bi a whirlwynd in to heuene; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.640

and the double spirit of Elye restide on Elisee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.641

and with the mantel of Elye Elysee smoot twies the watris of Jordon,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.642

and in the secunde tyme tho weren departid, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.643

and Elysee passide ouere.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.644

Aftirward Elisee dwellide in Jerico, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.645

and heelide the watris fro bittirnesse and bareynesse, bi putting of
salt in the watir.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.646

Thanne Elysee sti+gede into Betel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.647

and as he sti+gede bi the weye, litle children +geden out of the citee ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.648

and seiden to him in scorn,"Thou ballard, sti+g up! " CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.649

and he curside hem in the name of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.650

and twey beeris +geden out of the forest, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.651

and to-renten of hem xlij. children.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.652

After these thingis Joram, the king of Israel, and Josophat, the king of
Juda, and also the thridde king, that was king of Edom, weren in desert,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.653

and hadden no watir, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.654

and weren in poynt of perisching.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.655

These thre kingis camen to Elisee for helpe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.656

and bi spirit of prophecie he bad hem make dychis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.657

and thei si+gen neither wynd neither reyn, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.658

and the botme of dychis was fillid of watris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.659

and he bifore seide that God schulde bitake Moab in to the hondis of
these kingis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.660

and thei schulden distroie citees, and feeldis, and trees;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.661

and thus it was don in dede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.662

Also Elysee multypliede a litil oile, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.663

and made a pore widewe fille manye vessels therof, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.664

and bad hir paie her dettis bi sum therof, and that sche and her sones
schulden lyue bi the residue therof.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.665

Aftirward Elysee biforeseide to a good womman, that herbouride him freely
and largely, that sche schulde consceyue a sone; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.666

and whanne Elisee knew, that this sone was deed, he sente his seruaunt
Giesi with his staaf to reise him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.667

and neither vois neither feeling was in the chijld.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.668

Thanne Elysee entride in to a closet, where the chijld lay deed,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.669

and preiede to God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.670

and lay on the chijld, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.671

and leide his mouth to the mouth of the chijld, and hise hondis on the
chijldis hondis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.672

and the chijld +goxide vij. sithes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.673

and openede his i+gen; CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.674

and Elisee bitook the chijld qwyk to his modir.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,15.675

Also Elysee, whanne hungir was in Galgala, heelyde the pot of noyful mete,
bi sendinge in of mele, that no <P_I,16> more bitternesse was in the mete.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.676

Thanne Elisee made a litil breed to suffice to an c. men,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.677

and thei leften relijfs.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.678

Whanne the king of Sirie sente lettris to the king of Israel, that
he schulde cure Naaman of his lepre, and the king of Israel to-rente
his clothis for sorewe, Elysee bad, that Naaman schulde be waischen
vij. sithes in the water of Jordan, and so he schulde be curid;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.679

and thus it was don in deede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.680

Thanne Naaman knoulechide, that noon other God is in al the erthe no
but oonly the God of Israel; CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.681

and Elisee took noo +gifte, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.682

+ghe freely profrede and preeside of Naaman.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.683

Thanne Giesy ran aftir Naaman, vnwytinge either not consentinge his
maistir, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.684

and made a lesing, that Elisee sente to him, that he schulde +geue a
talent of syluer and double chaunging clothis to twey +gunge men of the
sones of profetis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.685

And Naaman constreynede him to take the double that he axide,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.686

and ordeynede twey children to bere bifore him.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.687

But herfore Elisee seide, that the lepre of Naaman schulde cleue to
Giesi and to his seede withouten ende; CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.688

and Giesi +gede out fro Elisee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.689

and was a mesel as snow.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.690

Whanne the sonis of prophetis +geden to the wode, to hewe doun wode to
bylde placis to hem to dwellin inne, the irun of an axe felde doun in

and Elisee castide doun the tree, either helue, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.692

and the irun houede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.693

and was taken up therbi.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.694

Whanne the king of Sirie sette buschementis preuyly a+gens the king of
Israel, Elisee warned the king of Israel therof; CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.695

and whanne it was certified to the king of Sirie that Elisee telde his
preuytes to the king of Israel, the king of Sirie sente a greet multitude
of the oost to take Elysee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.696

and whanne the oost cumpaside the citee Dotaym, wherinne Elysee was,
God made this oost blynd at the preier of Elisee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.697

and so he ledde hem into the myddis of Samarie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.698

and whanne the king of Israel wolde slee hem, Elisee seide nay,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.699

but bad make redy a feeste to hem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.700

and late hem go in pees to her lord.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.701

And whanne ful strong hungre was in Samarie, that wymmen eetyn her owne
children, oo womman axide doom of the king a+gens another womman, that
wolde not bi couenaunt bringe forth hir chijld to be etyn, whanne thei
hadden eten the chijld of the first womman.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.702

Thanne the king, that weeride the heire nexte his body, to-rente his
clothis for sorwe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.703

and swoor strongly, that in that day he wolde girde of the heed of Elisee.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.704

Elisee biforeknew the comynge of this messanger to do this deede,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.705

and bad men close the dore, and suffre not him for to entre,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.706

for his lord comith anoon aftir him to reuoke his ooth and sentence.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.707

Thanne Elise seide in Goddis name, that to morewe in this tyme a buschel

And Elisee seide to a gret duk, that bileeuede not this word,"Thou schalt
see it with thin i+gen, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.709

and schal not ete therof;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.710

and thus it was in dede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.711

for whanne the oost of Sirie fledde by ny+gt, for drede that God made

and at the vij. +geeris ende the king restoride to hire alle

CMPURVEY-M3,I,16.720

Benadab, king of Sirie, sent Asael to Elisee to enqueere whether this

Joram, the sone of Josophat, dide yuel in Goddis <P_I,17> si+gt, as the
hous of Acab dide; CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.725

for the dou+gtir of Acab was his wijf; CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.726

but God nolde distroie Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.727

for Dauith his seruaunt, as he bihi+gte to him, to +geue a lanterne to

Aftir these thingis Elisee bad oon of the sones of prophetis anoynte Hyeu

and doggis schulen ete Jesabel in the feeld of Jesrael,

and noon shall berie hir. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.732

And Hieu killide Joram, king of Israel, and Ocosias, king of Juda,
and Jesabel the cursid quene; CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.733

and doggis etyn the flesch of Jesabel; CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.734

and hir flesch was a tord on the face of erthe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.735

Thanne Hieu made lxx. sones of Acab to be slayn of hir keperis,

and bi this feyning he gaderid to gidere alle the prophetis, and prestis ,

and so Hieu dide awey Baal fro Israel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.746

Natheles Hieu +gede not awey fro the synnes of Joroboam,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,17.747

Therfore of alle the kingis of Juda was noon lyk him aftir him, but

And Isaie seide, in Goddis name, that thei schulde not drede of thes
wordis of Assiriens, CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.861

for God schal sende a spirit to Senacharib, CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.862

and he schal turne a+gen into his lond; CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.864

Therfore God counfortide Ezechie bi the prophete Isaie, that he schulde

Therfor God seide bi Isaie to him, that daies schulen come, and

CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.882

And Ezechie seide,"The word of God is good; CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.883

oonly pees and treuthe be in my daies. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.884

Aftir Ezechie Manasses his sone regnede lv. +geer in Jerusalem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.885

and dide gret yuel in Goddis si+gt, and mychel ydolatrie;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,19.886

and the peple of Juda was disceyued of Manasses, that thei diden more

<$$heading>

The bookis of Paralypomynon ben ful nescessarie to vndirstonde the
stories of the elde testament, in so myche, as Jerom seith, that if eny
man withouten these bookis wole presume to haue the kunnynge of hooly
scripturis, he scorne himself, that is, disseyue eithir make himself
worthi to be scorned; for whi the stories left out in the bookis of
Kingis be touchid in these bookis, and vnnumberable questiouns of the
gospel ben declarid by these bookis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1000

The firste book of Paralypomynon tellith in the bigynnynge the
generacyouns fro Adam til to Jacob, and so forth til to Dauith,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1001

and touchith schortly manye stories of Saul, and of Dauith, and of
Salomon, in the ende therof; and how Dauith ordeynede prestis and dekyns
in her offis, and how and bi what seruise thei schulden serue God.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1002

The bigynnyng of the ij. book of Paralipomynon tellith hou Salomon
axide of God wisedom to deme his peple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1003

and God +gaf to him wisdom, and kunnyng, and richesse, and glorie, so
that noon among kingis neither bifore neither aftir him was lyk him.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1004

Thanne is toold how Salomon byldide the temple of Jerusalem, and an hous
to himself.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1005

Aftir this the queene of Saba cam to Salomon, CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1006

and brou+gte many precious iewelis to him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1007

and preuede his kunnynge and wisdom in many thingis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1008

And alle the kingis of the erthe desyreden to see the face of Salomon
, for to here the wisdom of God, which he hadde +goue in his herte.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1009

Aftir this it sueth hou Roboam departide the x. lynagis fro
the hous of Dauith bi his pride and harde wordis, and bi suynge of the
counceil of +gunge men; CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1010

and whanne the rewme of Juda was confermyd to him, he forsook the lawe
of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,21.1011

and al <P_I,22> Israel dide the same with him.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1012

Therfore God sente the king of Egipt with vnnoumbrable peple on hem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1013

and took awey the tresours of Goddis hous and of the kingis hous,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1014

and thei serueden the king of Egipt, to knowe the dyuersite of
Goddis seruise, and of the seruise of the rewme of the londis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1015

Aftir him regnede Abia, his sone, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1016

and he tretide wijsely with the peple of Israel, that thei schulde
forsake her synne, and werrey not a+gens Goddis puple and the rewme of
Juda; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1017

and for thei wolde proudly werreye a+gens the rewme of Juda, and a+gens
this good counceil of Abia, he killyde of hem bi Goddis help v.
hundrid thousynd of stronge men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1018

Aftir this counceil Abia di+gede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1019

and Asa his sone rengnede for him; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1020

and in the daies of Asa the lond was in reste x. +geer;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1021

and Asa dide that that was good and plesaunt in the si+gt of God,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1022

and he distroiede auteris of ydolatrie, and hi+ge placis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1023

and he brak ymagis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1024

and hewyde doun wodis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1025

and comaundide the peple of Juda to seeke the Lord God of her fadris,
and do his lawe, and kepe alle hise heestis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1026

He rengnide in pees, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1027

and byldide stronge citees with wallis, and touris, and +gatis, and
lockis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1028

and he hadde in his oost thre hundrid thousind of Juda, of men
beringe scheeldis and speris, and of Beniamyn ij. hundrid
thousind and lxx. thousind of men of armes, and of archeris.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1029

And he ouercam the king of Ethiopie, that cam with x. c.
thousind men and iij. c. charris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1030

and Asa hadde the victorie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1031

for in trist of Goddis help he cam a+gens this gret multitude.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1032

Thanne the prophete of God seide to Asa and al his peple,"The Lord is

for +ge weren with hym; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1034

if +ge seeken hym +ge schulen fynde; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1035

and if +ge forsaken him he schal forsake +gou; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1036

many daies schulen passe in Israel withoute veri God, and without prest,
and techere, and lawe; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1037

and whanne thei turnen a+gen in her angwische, and crien to God, and
seekyn him, thei schulen fynde him.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1038

Be +ge confortid, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1039

and +goure hondis be not maad vnstedfast, for whi mede schal be to +goure
werk. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1040

And whanne Asa hadde herd these wordis, and profecie, he was coumfortid
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1041

and dide awey alle ydols fro al the lond of Juda and of Beniamyn, and
fro the citees whiche he hadde take of Effraym.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1042

And he gaderide to gidere al the puple vndir him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1043

and he entride into Jerusalem, to make stronge the boond of pees, that
thei schulden seeke the Lord God of her fadris in al her herte and al
her soule, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1044

and he seide,"If eny man seekith not the Lord God of Israel,
di+ge he, fro the leeste til to the meeste, fro man til to womman.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1045

And thei sworen with al hire herte and with al hire wille,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1046

thei sou+gten God CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1047

and founden hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1048

and God +gaf reste to hem bi cumpas.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1049

And whanne the king of Israel werride a+gens Aza, Asa sente mychil gold
and syluer to the king of Syrie, to helpe him, and to werreye a+gens
the king of Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1050

and he dide so.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1051

Thanne God blamyde Asa greetly, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1052

for he triste in the king of Sirie, and not in God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1053

"And therfor the oost of the king of Sirie ascapide fro thin hond,
"seide God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1054

"and also bateiles schulen rise a+gens thee in present tyme. "
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1055

And Asa was wrooth a+gens the prophete, that telde this to hym,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1056

and puttide him in the stockis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1057

and God hadde ful gret indingnacoun on this thing, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1058

and killide full manye men of the puple in that tyme.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1059

And in the ende of his lijf Asa hadde ful greet syknesse of his feet,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1060

and in his syknesse he sou+gte not the Lord, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1061

but triste more in the craft of lechis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1062

And Asa di+gede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1063

and Josophat his sone regnede for hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1064

and was strong a+gens lsrael.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1065

And king Josophat ordeynede noumbris of kni+gtis in alle wallid citees
of Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1066

and ordeynede strong hooldis in the lond of Juda, and in the citees of
Effrahym, whiche Asa his fadir hadde take.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1067

And the Lord was with Josophat, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1068

and he +gede in the firste weies of Dauith his fadir,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1069

and he hopide not in Baalym, but in God Almy+gty, CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1070

and +gede in his comaundementis, and not bi the synnes of Israel.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1071

And God confermyde the rewme in the hond of Josophat,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1072

and he hadde ful many richessis and myche glorie; CMPURVEY-M3,I,22.1073

and whanne his herte hadde take trist for the weies of the Lord, he
dide aweye also hi+ge placis and woodis fro Judea, where the puple made
offring out of <P_I,23> Jeru-salem a+gens the lawe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1074

And Josophat in the iij. +geer of his rewme sente fyue
of his princis, that thei schulde teche in the citees of Juda;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1075

and he sente ix. deknes with hem, and ij. prestis with hem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1076

and thei hadden the book of Goddis lawe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1077

and tau+gten the peple in Juda; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1078

and thei cumpassiden alle the citees of Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1079

and tau+gten al the peple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1080

Therfore the drede of the Lord was maad on alle rewmys of londis that
weren bi the cumpas of Juda, and dursten not werreye a+gens Josophat.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1081

And he hadde redy at his hond xj. c. thousind and
lx. c. thousind of kni+gtis, and men of armys, and archers,
outaken othere whiche he hadde set in wallid citees, and in all Juda.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1082

And Filisteyis and Arabeyes brou+gten to Josophat +giftis and tributis,
and many thousindis of scheep and buckis of geet.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1083

And aftir this doinge Josophat was alyed to Acab, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1084

and +gede with hym to bateile into Ramoth of Galaad, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1085

and iiij. c. prophetis, that weren disseyued bi a spirit
of lesing, excitide Acab to this werre, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1086

and bihi+gte prosperite and victorie to him; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1087

but Mycheas, oo trewe prophete of God, telde to Acab that he schulde
di+ge in this bataile, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1088

and so it was indeede; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1089

and Josophat, that was in moost perel of this bateile, was sauid bi
Goddis help.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1090

Aftir this bateil Josophat turnede a+geen in pees to Jerusalem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1091

and a prophete of God mette him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1092

and seide,"Thou helpist the wickid man, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1093

and art ioyned in frenschip to hem that haten God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1094

and therfor thou disseruedist the wraththe of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1095

but goode werkis ben founden in thee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1096

for thou didest awey wodis fro the lond of Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1097

and madist redy thin herte to seeke the Lord God of thi fadris.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1098

Therfore Josophat dwellide in Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1099

and eft he +gide out to the peple fro Bersabe til to the hil of Effraym
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1100

and clepide hem a+gen to the Lord God of her fadris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1101

and he ordeynede iugis of the lond in alle stronge citees of Juda bi

and he comaundide thus to the iugis,"See +ge, what +ge owen to do,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1103

for +ge vsen the dom not of man but of the Lord, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1104

and what euer thing that +ge schal deme, schal turne into +gou;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1105

the dreede of the Lord be with +gou, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1106

and do +ge alle thingis with diligence; for whi neither wickidnesse,
neither taking of persoones, neither coueitise of +giftis, is anentis
+goure Lord God. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1107

And in Jerusalem Josophat ordeynede dekenes and prestis, and princis
of meynes of Israel, that thei schulde deme to the dwelleris therof the
doom and cause of God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1108

and he comaundide to hem CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1109

and seide,"Thus +ge schulen do in the drede of the Lord feithfully,
and in a perfit herte; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1110

ech cause that cometh to +gou of +goure britheren that dwellen in her

veniaunce come not on +gow, and on +goure britheren; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1111

therfore do +ge thus and +ge schule not do synne; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1112

and Amarie, +goure prest and bischop, schal be souereyn in these thingis
that perteynyn to God. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1113

Aftir these thingis the sones of Amon, and the sones of Moab, and
with men of Ydume, weren gaderid togidere to werrye a+gens Josophat.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1114

Thanne Josophat +gaf him al to beseche God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1115

and prechide fasting to al Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1116

and al Juda was gaderid to biseeche the Lord; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1117

and Josophat knoulechide, that he hadde not power to a+genstonde so
greet a multitude of enemyes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1118

Thanne God coumfortide him and his peple bi a prophete, that thei schulde
not dreede this greet multitude of enemyes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1119

for God himself schulde fi+gte and ouercome her enemyes, without strook
of his peple; CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1120

and so it was in dede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1121

At the laste, Josophat made frenschipe with Ocosie, king of Israel,
whois werkis weren ful yuele, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1122

and thei weren felowis to make schippis, that schulden go into Tarsis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1123

Therfor God bi his prophete seide to Josophat,"For thou haddist boond
of pees with Ocosie, God hath smyte thi werkis,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1124

and the schippis ben al to-broken CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1125

and my+gten not go into Tarsis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1126

Thanne di+gede Josophat, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1127

and Joram his sone rengnyde for hym.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1128

This Joram weddide the dou+gtir of Acab, CMPURVEY-M3,I,23.1129

and killide <P_I,24> hise owne britheren, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1130

and +gede in the weies of the kingis of Israel, as the hous of Acab
hadde do; CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1131

and he dide ydolatrie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1132

and made the dwelleris of Jerusalem and also Juda to breke Goddis lawe.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1133

Therfor Edom and Lobna +geden awey fro his lordschipe,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1134

for he hadde forsake the Lord God of his fadris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1135

and therfore God reiside a+gens him Filisteys and Arabeys, that coosteyen
with Ethiopiens, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1136

and thei distroieden the lond of Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1137

and token awey al the catel that was founden in the hous of the king,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1138

and tooken awey his wijf and sones, outaken Joachas the +gungeste.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1139

And God smoot Joram with vncurable sorewe of wombe twey +ger, so that
he rotid on erthe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1140

and castide out hise entrailis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1141

and di+gede in worst syknesse.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1142

And his sone Ocosias rengnyde for him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1143

and dide yuele as the hous of Acab, for whi his modir excitide him to

and thei of the hous of Acab weren his councelers into his deth,

After these thingis Joas waas maad king, bi the helpe of Joiada the

and he sente prophetis to hem, that thei schulden turne a+gen to God,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1165

and thei nolde heere these profetis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1166

And Sacarie, the prest and sone of Joiada, repreuede hem for this synne,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1167

and thei stonyden hym to deth in the purseynt of Goddis hous, by
comaundement of the king.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1168

<$$heading>

Amasie dide good in party, but not in a parfit herte,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1185

and he killide hem that hadden slayn the king his fadir,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1186

but he killide not her sones, as God bad in the lawe.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1187

This Amasie foond in al Juda and Beniamyn fro xx. +geer and

CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1189

And a man of God seide to Amasie,"A!  thou king, the oost of Israel go
not out with thee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1190

for the Lord is not with Ysrael, and with alle the sones of Effraym ; that
if thou gessist that bateilis stonden in the strengthe of oost, the Lord
schal make thee to be ouercomen of thin enemyes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1191

for it is propir to God for to helpe, and for to turne into fli+gt.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1192

Therfore Amasie departyde awey the oost of Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1193

and tristily ledde forth his puple to bataile; CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1194

and he hadde the victorie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,24.1195

And aftir this victorie Amasie worschipide the goddis of Edom,

"CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1198

Whanne the prophete spac these thingis to him, he answeride to the
prophete,"Wher thou art a counceler of the king?  CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1199

ceese thou, lest perauenture I slee thee. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1200

Therfore the prophete +gede awey, CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1201

for thou hast doo this yuel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1203

and ferthermore thou assentidist not to my counceil:"
CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1204

for bi pride he terride the king of Israel to werre, CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1206

and nolde ceese for heleful counceil of the king of Israel.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1207

Therfore the king of Israel ouercam the puple of Juda,

for God helpide him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1227

and made him stronge.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1228

But whanne he was maad stronge, his herte was reisid into his deth,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1229

and he dispiside his Lord God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,25.1230

and aftir that he was angwischid, he preiede his Lord God,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,27.1374

and he dide penaunce gretly bifore the God of his fadris,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,27.1375

and he preiede hertily, CMPURVEY-M3,I,27.1376

and God herde his preier, CMPURVEY-M3,I,27.1378

and brou+gte him a+gen in to Jerusalem, into his rewme.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,27.1379

And Manasses knew that the Lord himself is God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,27.1380

CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1387

Manasses di+gede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1388

and Amon his sone regnide for him ij. +ger in Jerusalem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1389

CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1409

and so thei diden in deede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1410

And Elchie, the gret prest, +gaf to Saphan, the scriueyn and solempne
messenger, the book of Goddis lawe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1411

and he bar it to the king; CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1412

and whanne the king hadde herd the wordis of the lawe, he to-rente hise

and he comaundede Elchie and othere grete men to goo, and preie the Lord
for the king, and for the resydues of Israel and of Juda, on alle the
words of the book of Goddis lawe;"for whi greet veniaunce of God hath
droppid on vs, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1414

for oure fadris kepten not the wordis of God, that thei diden alle
thingis that ben writen in this book. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1415

Therfore Elchie, and thei that weren sent togidere of the king, +geden
to Olda, a profetesse, the wijf of Sellum; CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1416

and God seide bi hir that he schal bringe in on this place and dwelleris
therof yuelis, and alle cursinges that ben writen in this book of Goddis

for thei forsoken God CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1418

and sacrificiden to alyen goddis, to terre him to wrathfulnesse, in alle
the werkis of her hondis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1419

"but for thou, king of Juda, herdist the wordis of the book, and were
meekid in Goddis si+gt, and weptist and to-rentist thi clothis, I haue
herd thee,"seith God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1420

"and thou schalt be born in to thi sepulcre in pees, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1421

and thin i+gen schulen not see al the yuel which Y schal bringe in on
this place, and on the dwelleris therof. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1422

And whanne Josie hadde herd these wordis, he clepide togidere alle the
eldre men of Juda and of Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1423

and he sti+gide in to Goddis hous, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1424

and alle men of Juda and the dwelleris of Jerusalem sti+giden togidere,
prestis and deknis, and al the puple fro the leeste til to the moste,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1425

and in audiense of hem the king redde in Goddis hous alle the wordis of
the book; CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1426

and he stood in his trone, eithir seete of doom, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1427

and smoot boond of pees bifore God, that he schulde go aftir God, and

and al his soule, and do tho thingis that ben writen in that book whiche
he hadde red.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1428

And he chargide gretly on this thing alle men that weren founden in
Jerusalem and Beniamyn; CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1429

and the dwelleris of Jerusalem diden bi the couenaunt of the Lord God
of her fadris.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1430

Therfore Josie dide awey alle abomynaciouns fro alle the cuntreys of
the sones of Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1431

and made alle men, that weren residue in Israel, to serue her Lord God;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1432

in alle the daies of his lijf thei +geden not awey fro the Lord God of
her fadris.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1433

Aftirward Josie made pask in Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,28.1434

and <P_I,29> ordeynede prestis in hire officis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1435

and bad hem mynystre in Goddis hous, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1436

and bad dekenis serue God and his puple Israel, and make hem redy bi hire
housis and kinredis in the departing of ech, as Dauith, king of Israel,
comaundide, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1437

and bad hem serue in the seyntuarie, bi the meynes and cumpanyes and
dekenis, and that thei be halewid, and offre pask, and make redy her
britheren therto.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1438

And Josie made such a pask, that noon was lyk in Israel, fro the daies
of Samuel the prophete, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1439

neithir eny of the kingis of Israel made pask, as Josie dide, to prestis,
and dekenes, and to al Juda and Israel, and to the dwelleris of Jerusalem;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1440

for he +gaf to al the puple that was founden in Jerusalem in the
solempnite of pask, xxx. thousinde lambrin and kidis and othere
scheep, and iij. thousind of oxun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1441

Aftir that Josie hadde reparelid the temple, Necao, king of Egipt,
sti+gide to fi+gte in Cartamys, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1442

and Josie +gede forth a+gens him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1443

and the king of Egipt seide to Josie,"I come not to day a+gens thee,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1444

but I fi+gte a+gens another hous, to whiche God bad and made me go in
haste; CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1445

therfore ceese, thou king of Juda, to day a+gens God, which is with me,
lest he sle thee. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1446

Josie nolde turne a+gen, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1447

but made himself redy to bataile a+gens the king of Egipt,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1448

and assentide not to the wordis of the king of Egipt, spoken bi Goddis
mouth.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1449

Therfore Josie was slayn of the king of Egipt, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1450

and the peple of the lond made Joacas his sone king in Jerusalem.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1451

He regnide iij. moonthis in Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1452

and the king of Egipt puttide him doun, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1453

and condempnide the lond of Juda in an c. talentis of syluer,
and in a talent of gold, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1454

and made Eliachym his brothir kyng for him on Juda and Jerusalem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1455

and turnide his name Joachym.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1456

He regnide xj. +geer in Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1457

and dide yuel bifore God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1458

Therfore Nabugodonosor took him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1459

and ledde him boundyn with chaynes into Babilone, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1460

and baar thidir the vessels of Goddis temple; CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1461

and Joakin his sone rengnide for him iij. moonthis and x.
daies in Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1462

and dide yuel in Goddis si+gt.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1463

Thanne Nabugodonosor sente men that ledden hym into Babilone and bare
out the preciouseste vessels of Goddis hous; CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1464

and Nabugodonosor made Sedechie king on Juda and Jerusalem.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1465

He rengnide xj. +geer in Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1466

and dide yuel in Goddis si+gt, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1467

neithir was aschamyd of the face of Jeremye, the prophete, that spac to

He brak the ooth maad too Nabugodnosor; CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1469

therfore Nabugodnosor cam CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1470

and took hym, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1471

and ledde him and alle the vessels and the tresouris of Goddis hous and

And Cirus, king of Perseys, comaundide to be prechid, +ghe bi

CAP. X. CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1479

<$$heading>

This proces of Paralypomynon in the j. and ij. book schulde
stire cristene kingis and lordis to distroie synne, and loue vertu, and
make Goddis lawe to be knowe and kept of her puple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1481

for heere thei mown se, hou sore God punschide yuele kingis, that lyueden
yuele, and drowen the puple to idolatrie, either other gret synnes,
and hou greetly God preyside, rewardide, and cherischide good kinges,
that lyueden wel, and gouernede wel the puple in Goddis lawe, and opin
resoun, and good conscience.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1482

And thou+g kingis and lordis knewen neuere more of hooly scripture than
iij. stories of the ij. book of Paralypomynon and of Regum
, that is, the storie of king Josophat, the storie of king Ezechie,
and the storie of king Josie, thei my+gte lerne sufficiently to lyue
wel and gouerne wel hire puple bi Goddis lawe, and eschewe al pride,
and ydolatrie, and coueitise, and other synnes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,29.1483

But alas!  alas!  alas!  where king Jozophat sente hise princis,
and dekenes, and prestis, to ech citee of <P_I,30> his rewme with
the book of Goddis lawe, to techen opinly Goddis lawe to the puple,
summe cristene lordis senden general lettris to alle her mynistris,
and leegemen eithir tenauntis, that the pardouns of the bisschopis
of Rome, that ben opin leesingis, for thei graunten many c.
+geeris of pardoun aftir domes day, be prechid generaly in her rewmes
and lordschipis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1484

and if eny wijse man a+genseith the opin errouris of anticrist, and teche
men to do her almes to pore nedy men, to ascape the peynes of helle,
and to winne the blisse of heuene, he be prisoned, as a man out of
cristen bileue, and traytour of God, and of cristen kingis and lordis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1485

And where king Ezechie made him ful bisy to clense Goddis hous, and do
awey al vnclennesse fro the sentuarie, and comaundide prestis to offre
brent sacrifice on Goddis auteer, and ordeynede dekenis in Goddis hous
to herie God, as Dauith and other prophetis ordeyneden, summe cristene
lordis in name, and hethene in condiscouns defoulen the sentuarie of God,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1486

and bringin in symonient clerkis, ful of coueitise, eresie, and ypocrisie,
and malice, to stoppe Goddis lawe, that it be not knowen and kept,
and frely prechid; CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1487

and +git summe cristene lordis holden many prelatis and curatis in
her courtis and in seculer offis a+gens Goddis lawe and mannis opinly,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1488

and withholden hem fro her goostly offis and helping of cristen soulis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1489

and where king Josie prechide opinly Goddis lawe in the temple to al
the puple, and castide awey idolis, and brente the boonis of prestis
, that diden idolatrie, summe cristen lordis in name not in dede,
preisen and magnifien freris lettris, ful of disceit and leesingis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1490

and make hire tenauntis and meyne to swere bi herte, boonis, nayles,
and sydes, and other membris of Crist, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1491

and pursuen ful cruely hem that wolden teche treuly and freely the lawe
of God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1492

and preisen, mayntenen, and cherischen hem, that prechen fablis
, lesingis, and synful mennis tradiciouns, either statutis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1493

and letten greetly the gospel to be prechid, and holy writ to be knowen
and kept.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1494

But wite these vnwyse lordis, that Elye the prophete, oon aloone hadde the
treuthe of God, and king Acab with viij. c. and l.
prestis and prophetis of Baal hadde the false part; CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1495

and eft Mycheas, oon aloone prophete of God, hadde the treuthe a+gens
iiij. c. prophetis of Baal, that counceileden Acab go to
werre to his owne schenschipe and deth; CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1496

so now a fewe pore men and idiotis, in comparisoun of clerkis of scole,
mown haue the treuthe of holy scripture a+gens many thousinde prelatis
and religiouse, that ben +gouen to worldly pride and coueitise, symonie,
ypocrisie and other fleschly synnes, moost sithen these pore men desiren
oonly the treuthe and fredom of the hooly gospel, and of hooly scripture
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1497

and accepten manis lawis and ordynauncis, oonly in as myche as thei ben
groundid in holy scripture, eithir good resoun, and comyn prophit of
cristen puple; CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1498

and worldly prelatis and feyned relygious grounden hem on synful mennis
statutis, that sounnen pride and coueitise, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1499

and letten the treuthe and fredom of Goddis lawe to be knowen and kept,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1500

and bringen cristen puple in nedeles tharldam and greet cost.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1501

But it is for to drede ful sore lest kingis and lordis ben now in the
formere synnes of Manasses; CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1502

God graunte that thei repenten verily and make amendis to God and men,
as he dide, in the ende; CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1503

for thei setten idolis in Goddis hous, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1504

and exciten men to idolatrie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1505

and scheden innocent blood in many maners, as Manasses dide.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1506

First thei setten in her herte, that schulde be the temple and specialy
chaumbre of God, the idole of coueitise, either of glotonie, either of
pride, either of other greet synnes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1507

for seint Poul seith, that oure bodies ben the temple of the Hooly Goost,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1508

and eft he seith, that auarice is the seruise of idolis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1509

and eft he seith, that glotouns maken her bely her God;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1510

and God seith bi Job, that the deuil is king ouer alle the sones of
pride, CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1511

and Jhesu Crist seith, that the deuil is prince of this world,
that is, as Austin seith, of false men that dwellen in this world.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,30.1512

Thanne thei that setten pride, either coueitise, either glotonie, either
rauyn, in her herte, settyn idolis of <P_I,31> Baal, either of the deuil,
in the temple of God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1513

Specialy lordis setten idolis in Goddis hous, whanne thei maken vnworthi
prelatis either curatis in the chirche; for whi such vnable prelatis
either curatis ben idolis, as God seith in xj. c. of
Zacarie to an vnable prelat,"A!  thou schepherde, and idole, forsakinge
the floc;"wherfor Erchedekene in Rosarie, which is oon of the famouseste
doctouris, and of the popis lawe, writith thus, "an yuel prelat is seid
a rorynge lyoun, and a wolf rauysching prey; "CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1514

and in the xxxiiij. c. of Esechiel, he is seid to feede
him self and not the scheep; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1515

also he is seid to seke his owne profitis temporal, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1516

therfore he is not of Goddis children, as Austyn seith in
viij. cause, j. questioun, c=o=. sunt quidam,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1517

and for this thing power schal be taken awey fro him, as God seith in
the xxxiiij. c. of Ezechiel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1518

Also an yuel prelat is seid a wolf, as the lawe witnessith in

also for defaute of gouernaile he is seid a vnchaast dogge, as Austyn

also he is a crowe, either a rauen, for the blacknesse of synnes , as the
lawe witnessith there, in c=o=. non omnis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1521

also he is seid fonned salt, not prophitable to eny thing, as the lawe
witnessith there, in c=o=. non omnis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1522

also he is seid an hog, as the lawe witnessith in xliij.
distinctioun, in c=o=. in mandatis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1523

also he is seid a cherl of cherlysched of yuel lijf, as the
lawe witnessith in xlvij. distinctioun, in the bigynnyng;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1524

also he is seid a capoun, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1525

for he hath the manere of an hen, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1526

for as a capoun crowith not, so an yuel prelat crowith not in preching ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1527

also an yuel prelat gendrith not bi preching of Goddis word,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1528

neithir he fi+gtith for hise sogetis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1529

also as the capoun clepith not hennis, so an yuel prelat clepith not
pore men to mete; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1530

also as a capoun makith fat himself, so an yuel prelat makith fat himself.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1531

Therfore sithen he seekith plenteuousnesse, metis, and richessis, he
schal be put into the fijer of helle, as Jerom witnessith on Mychee,
and in the xxxv. distinctioun, c=o=. ecclesie principes.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1532

Erchedekene writith al this in xliij. distinctioun, in c=o=.
sit rector, on the word muti.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1533

Also a doumb prelat is an ydol, and not a very prelat;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1534

a doumb prelat is not a very prelat, sithen he vsith not the offis of
a prelat, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1535

bot he hath oonly the licnesse of a prelat, as an ydol that vsith
not the offis of a man is oonly lijk a man, but it is noo man;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1536

therfore suche doumbe prelatis moun ri+gtfully be seid symylacris, either
ydolis, of whiche it is seid in the vi. c=o=. of Baruk,
"the trees of hem ben maad fair of a carpenter, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1537

and tho ben araied with gold and syluer, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1538

and moun not speke,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1539

and thei that maken suche prelatis ben lijk hem, whiche makeris schulen be
dampned with suche prelatis, bi that word of Dauith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1540

"thei that maken tho ben maad lijk tho. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1541

But marke wel, that hethene men hadden symylacris of vj. kyndis ,
that is, of cley, of tree, of bras, of stoon, of syluer, and of gold;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1542

we moun fynd these vj. kyndis in yuel prelatis; for whi symylacris
of cley ben fleschly prelatis, of whiche God seith in the sautir,
"I schal do hem awey as the cley of streetis;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1543

symylacris of tree ben vnwise prelatis and boistous and without wit,
of which it is seid in holy scripture,"a tree is wlappid in siluer;
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1544

and these ben seid to be maad of nou+gt in to prelatis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1545

thes ben beestis clepid chymeres, that han a part of ech beest,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1546

and suche ben not no but oonly in opynyoun, either speche, and not in
dede, neither in kynde; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1547

symylacris of bras ben thei, that han oonly worldly eloquence, for whi
brasse +geueth greet soun, in i. pistle to Corinth, xiij. c.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1548

"if I speke in the langagis of men and of aungels, and I have not charite,
I am maad as bras sounnynge;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1549

symylacris of stoon ben thei, that ben broken fro ri+gtfulnesse and vertu,
for temporal strengthe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1550

these prelatis ben not the stoon which is set into the heed of the corner
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1551

but these ben the stoon of hirtyng and of sclaundre; CMPURVEY-M3,I,31.1552

symylacris of syluer ben thei that ben maad bi moneye, eithir
richessis, whiche prelatis seyn, what wolen <P_I,32> +ge +geue to vs,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1553

and we schulen bitraie Crist to +gou; CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1554

golden symylacris ben thei that ben maad oonly for worldly nobleie,
for whi gold singnefieth nobley, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1555

and therfore the heed of the ymage of Nabugodonosor was of gold in
ij. c. of Daniel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1556

Erchedekene tellith al this in xliij. distinctioun, c=o=.
sit rector, on the word mutus.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1557

Thou+g this doctour of the popis lawe be pleyn and scharp, he seith
treuthe sesonable, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1558

for the chirche now acordith with hooly writ, and resoun, and comun
doctouris of holy scripture; CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1559

for in xi. c. of Sacariee, God clepith an yuel prelat an
ydol, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1560

and in Ezechiel and other prophetis he licneth tyrauntis and raueynouris
to lyouns, woluis, beeris, and othere vnresonable beestis, to dispise
her synne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1561

Here lordis and other prelatis moun see in party, hou perilous
it is to ordeyne yuele prelatis eithir curatis in the chirche,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1562

for as seint Gregory seith, in i. part of Pastoralis, ij.
c=o=. noo man harmeth more in the chirche, than he that
doth weiwardly, and holdith the name of ordre, eithir of holynesse;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1563

and the lawe seith de electionibus, c=o=. nichil, that no thing
harmeth more the chirche of God, than {it_harms_the_church} that vnworthi
men be taken to the gouernaile of soulis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1564

and Grostede seith in his sermoun Premonitus a venerabili patre, that
to make vnable prelatis eithir curatis in the chirche of God, is to haue
come to the hi+gest degree of trespasis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1565

also in his sermoun Dominus noster Jhesus Cristus, he writeth thus to the
pope,"he that bitakith the cure of soulis to a man vnmy+gti, vnkunnynge,
either not wilful to kepe duly the soulis, is gilty of alle the soulis,
thou+g eny ascapith, and is sauid bi Goddis grace, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1566

and he that bitakith the cure of soulis to him that is opinly vnable
therto, techith to sette more pris bi vnresonable beestis than by
men , and for to loue more erthly thingis, that passyn schortly, than
everlastinge thingis, and more than the deeth and blood of Goddis sone ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1567

and he that +geueth thus the cure of soulis to vnable men, is werse than
Eroude, that pursuede Crist, and worse thanne Jewis and hethene men,
that crucifieden Crist. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1568

Grostede seith this pleynly, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1569

and preueth it opinly bifore the pope and al his clergie;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1570

and thei that procuren beneficis and richessis to men, haten hem to whiche
thei procuren thus, as if thei procured hem to be set in the cop of the
chirche, in whirlwijndis and greet tempestis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1571

Grostede seith this in his sermoun Scriptum est de leuitis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1572

and he that is necligent to drawe soulis out of the pit of synne, as
myche as he may, bi the ordre of lawe, and he that lettith him of his
werk, sleeth the soulis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1573

and he that settith more prijs bi a fleschly scheep than a goostly scheep
, that is, mannis soule, settith more pris bi a peny than bi the lijf
of Goddis sone, which is worth al this world.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1574

A recheles curat, and that sleeth sogettis bi yuel ensaumple,
and withdrawing of Goddis word, is worse than vnresonable beestis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1575

and he is wrse than the crucifieris of Crist, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1576

for he crucifieth him in hise membris.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1577

Goode counceilouris thei ben aloone, that ben wijse men, and drede
God, for whi alle coueitouse men ben foolis, and vnwijse men,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1578

and to be led bi the counceil of hem is to dispose of henne cotis bi the
counceil of foxis, and to dispose of foldis of scheep bi the counceil
of woluis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1579

Grostede seith this in a sermoun Premonitus a venerabili patre.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1580

See, +ge lordis and prelatis, that maken vnable curatis, for fleschly
affeccioun and +giftis, and specialy for pleyinge at the bere, and othere
vnleeful iapis, what tresoun +ge doon to God, and what harm to Cristis
chirche and +goure auaunseeis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1581

+ge maken orrible abomynacoun of discoumfort stoonde in the hooly place
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1582

for +ge make anticrist to stonde at the hi+ge auter, in the stede of
Crist, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1583

and trete the holy sacrament of Cristis flesch and his blood ful
vnworthily, CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1584

and as Parisience seith, whanne +ge maken a coueitouse prest to stonde
at the auter, +ge maken a maldworp stonde there, in the stede of Crist ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,32.1585

and whanne +ge maken a fonned bischop, that can not and loueth not
Goddis lawe, stonde <P_I,33> my-trid at the auter, +ge make an horned
asse stonde at the auter, in the stede of Crist; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1586

and so of othere vnresonable beestis, as lyouns, wluis, beeris, apis,
dragouns, hoggis, horsis, doggis; and othere viciouse prestis, proude,
coueitouse, raueynouris, wrathful, ypocritis, trecherouse, glotenouse,
lecherouse, enuyouse, and bacbiteris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1587

and +ge transfiguren Satanas into an aungel of li+gt, whanne +ge maken
curatis either prelatis, that ben contrarie to Crist, to ocupie the
offis of bischop, abbot, either of prest.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1588

Lordis and prelatis, that han sett suche idolis in Goddis hous, as
Manasses dide, sue +ge Manasses in very repentaunce, and making of
amendis to God and men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1589

Also lordis and prelatis exciten strongly men to ydolatrie,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1590

for thei sweren custumably nedelesly, and ofte vnavisily and fals, bi
the membris of God, of Crist, and bi seintis, in so myche that ech lord
and greet prelat comynly makith to him an ydole of sum seint, whom he
worschipith more than God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1591

for comunly thei sweren bi oure Lady of Walsingham, seint Joon Baptiste
, seint Edward, seint Thomas of Caunterbury, and such othere seintis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1592

and chargen more this ooth than thou+g thei sweren by the Hooly Trinite
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1593

and in al this thei onoren more these seintis than thei onouren the
Hooly Trinite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1594

Thou+g it were leeueful to swere bi seintis, this is ydolatrie, to charge
more an ooth maad bi suche seintis than bi God Almy+gty, either bi the
Hooly Trinite; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1595

natheles Crisostom witnessith on the v. c=o=. of Matheu,
that to swere bi eny creature, is to do idolatrie; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1596

for as Jerom there, and Decrees, in xxij. cause, j.
questione, c=o=. si quis per capitulum, and c=o=. next
bifore, and Decretals de jure jurando, c=o=. et si Christus,
witnessen pleynly, to swere bi a creature is a+gens Goddis comaundement
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1597

and therfore Crist in the v. c=o=. of Math.
, comaundith to swere, not bi heuene, neither bi erthe,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1598

and vndirstondith bi heuene and erthe creaturis of heuene and creaturis
of erthe; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1599

and in al the old lawe it is not founden, where God grauntith to
swere bi eny creature, but oonly bi his owne name, either bi himself;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1600

and therfore the wise man seith in the xxiij. c=o=. of
Ecclesiastici"a man that swerith mychil schal be fillid with wickidnesse
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1601

and veniaunce schal not go awey fro his hous;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1602

and eft he seith,"thi mouth be not customable to swering, for whi myche
fallyng is in it; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1603

the nemyng of God be not customable in thi mouth,"that is, to swere bi his
name in veyn, either fals, either for an yuel ende; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1604

"and be thou not medlid with the names of seintis,"that is, to swere bi
seintis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1605

"for thou schalt not be giltlees of hem. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1606

Here lordis and prelatis moun see how thei don opin ydolatrie, whanne
thei gessen to onoure seintis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1607

and hire opin deedis of ydolatrie and blasfemye ben opin bookis of
ydolatrie and blasfemye to hire sugetis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1608

therfore, as Gregory seith in ij. bok of Pastrals v.
c=o=., prelatis ben worthi so many dethis, hou manye ensaumplis
of perdiscoun thei senden to sogettis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1609

and in xxv. c=o=. of Numery, God bad Moises hange alle
the princis in iebatis a+gens the sunne, CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1610

for the peple of Israel dide leccherie and idolatrie bi ensaumple and
suffraunce of hem.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1611

Now in Engelond it is a comyn proteccioun a+gens persecuscioun of prelatis
and of summe lordis, if a man is customable to swere nedeles, and fals,
and vnauisid, bi the boonys, nailes, and sidis, and other membris of
Crist, and to be proud and leccherous, and speke not of Goddis lawe,
and repreue not synne aboute him; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1612

and to absteyne fro oothis nedeles and vnleeueful, and to eschewe pride,
and speke onour of God and of his lawe, and repreue synne bi weie of
charite, is matir and cause now whi prelatis and summe lordis sclaundren
men, and clepen hem lollardis, eretikis, and riseris of debate and of
tresoun a+gens the king; CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1613

now Manasses settith idolis opinly in the temple of God,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,33.1614

and sterith men gretly to do idolatrie, and cherischen hem that breken
opinly Goddis heestis, and punysche hem soore, as hethene men either
eretikis, that bisien hem to lerne, kepe, and <P_I,34> teche Goddis
heestis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1615

the iij. tyme lordis and prelatis bothe schedden innocent blood,
as Manasses dide, CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1616

for thei waastyn folily hire goodis in wakingis and pleyingis bi ni+gt,
and in rere-soperis and othere vanites, CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1617

and taken grete and vnmesurable taxis of the comyns; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1618

and lesse lordis and prelatis doon greet extorciouns to pore men,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1619

and taken pore mennis goodis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1620

and paien litil either nou+gt and out of tyme for tho.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1621

Therfore, as Mychee the prophete seith in iij. c., thei
hyilden pore men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1622

and eten her flesch; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1623

and Grostede declarith wel this in his dicte that bygynneth thus
, sint lumbi vestri precinti, and in the xiij. dicte;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1624

and God seith in the Sautir of suche tirauntis,"thei deuouren my puple
as the mete of breed. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1625

How myche blood lordis scheden in werris, for pride and coueitise, by
counceil of false prelatis, confessouris, and prechouris, it passith
mannis wit to telle fully in this lijf; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1626

but of scheding of blood and sleeing of pore men, bi withdrawing of
almes, and in +geuynge it to dede stockis, either stoonis, either to
riche clerkis and feyned religiouse, were to speke now, if a man hadde
the spirit of goostly strengthe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1627

Now men knelyn, and preien, CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1628

and offren faste to dede ymagis, that han neither hungir neither coold ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1629

and dispisen, beten, and sleen Cristen men, maad to the ymage and lycnesse
of the Holy Trynite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1630

What onour of God is this to knele and offre to an ymage, maad of synful
mannis hondis, and to dispise and robbe the ymage maad of Goddis hondis,
that is, a cristen man, either a cristen womman.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1631

Whanne men +geue not almes to pore nedy men, but to dede ymagis, either
riche clerkis, thei robbyn pore men of her due porcoun, and needful
sustenaunce assingned to hem of God himself; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1632

and whanne suche offereris to dede ymagis robben pore men, thei robben
Jhesu Crist, as he seith in xxv. c=o=. of Math.,
"that, that +ge diden to oon of these leeste of myne, +ge diden to me,
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1633

and if thei schulen be dampned that +geuen not mete and drinke, and othere
nescessaries to pore men, as Crist seith, where schulen thei become that
robben pore men, and so Jhesu Crist himself; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1634

and if these tweyne, that +geuen not lyflode, and that robben pore men
, schulen be dampned so depe in helle, where schulen false techeris,
stireris, and confessouris bicome, that stiren lordis and riche men to
robbe thus pore men, and to do this vndir the colour of excellent almes
and holynesse?  CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1635

But morne we sore for this cursidnesse, CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1636

and preie we to God with al oure herte, that sithen lordis and prelatis
suen Manasses in these opyn synnes, God stire hem to sue Manasses in very
penaunce, and make amendis to God and men, lest oure reume be conquerid
of aliens, either hethen men, for these opyn synnes and many moo.

CAP. XI. CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1639

<$$heading>

The firste book of Esdras tellith, how Cirus, king of Perseys, +gaf
lycence to Jewis to turne a+gen in to Jerusalem and Judee, and bylde the
temple of God in Jerusalem, and bad that other men in his rewme schulden
helpe to this bylding; CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1641

and he +gaf the vessels herto whiche Nabugodnosor hadde take awey fro
Jerusalem.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1642

Thanne is teld the noumbre of hem that turnede a+gen into Judee, vndir
Josue the prest, the sone of Josedech, and vndir Sorobabel, the duyk;
and hou thei bygunnen to bylde the auter and temple; and what letting
thei hadden of enemyes, and what coumfort of God, and of hise prophetis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1643

Thanne it is teld, what sorwe Esdras made, for the princis and prestis
and comyns token hethene wommen to wyues a+gens the lawe; and how the
princis and the puple repentiden mekely and verily, and maden amendis
to God and men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,34.1644

In the book of Neemye, which is clepid the ij. book of Esdras
, is teld, how Neemye gat graunt of the king to bylde the wallis
of Jerusalem, and how he and othere men, bothe prestis and othere,
princis and comyns, bildiden the wallis, and +gatis, and lockis, and
touris aboue, for defense a+gens <P_I,35> enemyes; and how the enemyes
of Jewis purposiden with strong hond to slee Jewis preuely, and distroie
hire werk.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1645

Thanne half the part of +gunge men made the werk, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1646

and half the part was redy to bateyle; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1647

with oon hond thei maden the werk, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1648

and with the other thei helden the swerd; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1649

and eche of hem that bildide was gird with his swerd.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1650

Thanne it sueth how Neemye, duk of the puple, dide freely his offis,
and took noo costis assingned to the duk, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1651

and he dide thus for the pouert of the puple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1652

Aftir this doinge Esdras redde in the book of Goddis lawe, fro
the morewitide til to noon bifore the multitude of men and wymmen,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1653

and dekenes made silence in the puple to here the lawe;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1654

and Esdras redde in the book of Goddis lawe fro the firste day til to
the laste.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1655

Thanne the children of Israel camyn togidere in fasting and in sackis,
either heiris, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1656

and erthe was on hem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1657

and the seed of the sones of Israel was departid fro ech alyen sone,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1658

and thei stoden bifore the Lord, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1659

and knoulechiden her synnes, and the wickidnessis of hire fadris,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1660

and thei risiden togidere to stonde, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1661

and thei redden in the book of lawe of hire God fouresithis in the day,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1662

and fouresithis in the ny+gt thei knoulechiden and heryeden hire Lord
God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1663

and dekenes cryeden with gret vois to hire Lord God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1664

and baddin the puple rise and blesse God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1665

Thanne sueth the solempne confessioun of Esdras, how he knoulechide
first the glorious werkis of God, and aftirward the orrible synnes of
al the puple, and of hire fadris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1666

and thanne al the peple made couenaunt, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1667

and swor to kepe Goddis lawe, and to bie not in the sabat and haliday
of hem that brou+gten viteilis to selle; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1668

and thei bihi+gten to paie the firste fruitis to prestis, and
tithis to the dekenes, and to bringe al this to the temple of God.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1669

At the laste Neemye suffride neither Jewis neither straungeris sille
neither bie in the sabotis, not oonly in Jerusalem, but neither in placis
ny+g the wallis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1670

and he rebuykede, and curside, and beet men, and made hem ballid, that
token alien wommen to be hire wyues, as of Asotus, of Amon, and of Moab;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1671

and chargide hem greetly in the Lord, that thei schulden not +geue hire
dou+gtris to the sones of hethen men, and take nou+gt of the dou+gtris
of hethen men to hire owne sones, and to hem self.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1672

This proces of Esdras and of Neemye schulde styre vs to be bisy to
biylde vertues in oure soule, aftir turnyng a+gen fro caitifte of synne,
and to fi+gte a+gens temptaciouns, and byilde faste vertues, as thei
fou+gten with oon hond a+gens enemyes, and biyldeden with the tothir
hond; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1673

and we schulden be ful bisy to kepe the gostely sabot in goode werkis
and herying of God, sithen thei were so besy to kepe the figuratif sabot.

Thou+g the book of Tobie is not of bileeue, it is ful deuout storie,
and profitable to the symple puple, to maken hem to kepe patience and
Goddis heestis, to do werkis of mercy, and teche wel hire children,
and to take wyues in the drede of God, for loue of children, and not al
for foul lust off body, neither for coueitise of goodis of this world;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1675

and also children moun lerne heere bi +gunge Tobie to be meke and obedient
, and redy to serue fadir and modir in her nede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1676

Therfore amonge alle the bookis of the elde testament symple men of wit
schulden rede and here ofte this book of Tobie, to be trewe to God in
prosperite and aduersite, and eschewe idolatrie, glotenye and coueitise ,
and to be pacient in tribulacoun, and go neuere awey fro the dreede and
loue of God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1677

Thou+g the seene of clerkis, either general gadering of clergie, hath
take the book of Judith among the noumbre of hooly scripturis, natheles
it is not of the canoun eithir feith of the bible anentis Ebreis ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1678

for thei resseyuen not the autoritie of this book; CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1679

natheles it was writen in Caldee langage, CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1680

and is noumbrid among stories, as Jerom witnessith on the prolog.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,35.1681

But natheles this book comendith chastite and abstinence, penaunce and
wideuhood of Judith, and her loue <P_I,36> which sche hadde to deliuere
Goddis puple fro her enemyes, and to kepe the feith and worschiping of
God among his peple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1682

Also this book comendith the feith and treuthe of Achior, that was
conuertid to Goddis lawe bi myracle of sleeing of Olofernes, bi the
hondis of the widewe Judith.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1683

Thanne Judith repreuede prestis CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1684

for thei temtide God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1685

and consentiden to deliuere the citee to enemyes, if God sente not helpe
to hem withinne v. daies, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1686

and goode prestis tooken meekly this repreuyng of a womman;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1687

and sche tau+gte hem hou thei schulden do penaunce for this trespas,
and coumforte the puple to triste in God, and abyde his mercy and help,
at his owne wille.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1688

Vs nedith not to excuse Judith fro lesingis and tresoun to Olofernes,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1689

but we moun fauorably excuse hire fro deedly synne in this doinge
, for the greet loue that sche hadde to Goddis peple, and to slee
Olofernes, a blasfemyere of God, and distroiere of his lawe and peple ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1690

and iustly God took this veniaunce on Olofernes, for his synnes and
harmes don to Goddis peple, and whiche he purposide to do, if he my+gte
lyue longe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1691

Of this proces proude werriouris schulden drede God, that made proud
Olofernes to be slayn of a womman, and al his greet oost to be scaterid
and distroied; CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1692

and cristen men schulden be coumfortid greetly, for to haue ful trist
in God, and in his helpe, that so my+gtily delyuerede his puple fro
so greet an enemy and strong oost, withouten perisching of his peple.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1693

And sithen Judith hadde so greet preising for hire doinge, that was
medelid with manye synnes, myche more preising schulen thei haue in
heuene, withouten ende, that putten forth hem silf to be martirid
for Goddis cause, with trewe meenes of pacience and of charite.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1694

The book of Ester tellith first, how the qwene Vasti was forsaken for
hire pride, and was departid fro mariage of king Assuerus, and hou Ester,
for hire meekenesse, bewte, and Goddis grace was maad qwene in the stide
of Vasty.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1695

Also the trewe Mardoche, the fadir in lawe of adopcioun of this womman
Ester, tau+gte hire to loue God, and kepe his lawe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1696

and sche was full meke and obedient to Mardochee, +ghe, whanne sche was
qwene, as to hire fadir in lawe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1697

Thanne Aaman, of the kinrede of Agag, conspyride bi sotil malice
to distroie al the peple of Jewis, in the lond of Assuerus,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1698

and hadde graunt of the king, at his owne wille, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1699

and the day of distroiyng and of sleeing of the Jewis was pupplischid
thour+g al the rewme.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1700

Thanne Mardochee and the Jewis diden greet penaunce, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1701

and maden gret sorwe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1702

and preieden God to helpe in that gret nede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1703

And Mardochee sente to Ester, that sche schulde do the same, and
goo to the king, in perel of hire lijf, to axe grace of him, and
reuoking of lettris and power grauntid to Aman, the enemy of Jewis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1704

And aftir myche fasting, penaunce, and preier, Estir bitook hirself to
Goddis disposicioun, and to perel of her deth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1705

and entride to the king, +ghe, a+gens the lawe of the lond, whanne sche
was not clepid, to axe mercy and help of the king, for hirsilf and al
hire puple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1706

And God turnede the feersnesse and cruelte of the king to mekenesse
, mersy, and benyngnite a+gens Ester, and the peple of Jewis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1707

And thanne he reuokide the power grauntid to Aaman, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1708

and leet hange him, as he purposide to haue hangid the trewe Mardochee ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1709

and +gaf general power to Jewis to slee alle hire enemyes in his empire.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1710

Aftir these thingis the king enhaunside Mardochee, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1711

and made him grettist next the king, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1712

and +gaf greet fraunchise and onour to the Jewis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1713

This story of Ester schulde stire men to be trewe to God and his lawe,
and putte awey pride and enuye, and euere triste in God in alle perrels
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1714

and tirauntis schulden be aferd to conspire a+gens Goddis seruauntis
, leest God take veniaunce on hem, as he dide on this man Aaman
, that conspiride the deeth and general distroiyng of Jewis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1715

The book of Job is ful sotil in vndirstonding, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1716

for Job argueth a+gens hise enemyes, that wolden bringe hym out of
cristen feith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1717

and concludith many errouris that suen of hire false bileeue and opynyon
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1718

and Job affermith not that al is soth that he spekith a+gens hise
aduersaries, CMPURVEY-M3,I,36.1719

but concludith hem in hire fals <P_I,37> bileeue, that many errouris
suen therof; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1720

and for I haue declarid in party in the glos hou the harde sentensis
of Job schulen be vndirstonden, therfore I passe ouer li+gtly now.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1721

First this book tellith the kyn of Job, and hise richessis, and holy
lijf of him and hise children; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1722

and aftirward it tellith what tribulacoun bifelde to Joob in his catel,
in hise children, and in his owne bodi, and hou paciently he suffride
this, and thankide God in alle hise dissesis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1723

Thanne his wijf, whom the deuel reseruede as a special instrument to him,
to disseyue Joob by his wif, as he disseyuede Adam bi Eue, counceld him
to blasfeme God, and therbi di+ge; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1724

and Joob repreuede hire foly, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1725

and seide, if we han resseyued goodis of Goddis hond, whi suffre we not
yuels, that is, peynes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1726

In alle these thingis Joob synnede not in hise lippis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1727

Thanne sueth the disputing bitwixe Joob and hise freendis, almest til
to the ende of the book.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1728

Job heeld strongly the treuthe of cristen feith, and specialy of the
rising a+gen of bodies at domis day; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1729

and hise freendis seiden many treuthis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1730

and medleden falsnesse, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1731

and euere purposiden an yuel ende and falsed, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1732

for thei helden that meede is +gouen oonly in this lijf for goode
werkis, and that no man is punyschid here, no but for synnes passid,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1733

and as a man is punyschid more than an other in this lif, so he hath
synned more than another man lesse punschid; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1734

but al this is fals, as Joob preuith, and God confermith in the ende.
For whi reward of goode deedis is myche more in the lijf to comynge,
thanne in present lijf, and a vertuose man is punyschid here for to haue
mede in heuene; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1735

and comunly a iust man hath more tribulacoun in this lijf thanne a
wickid man, as it is opin of Crist, that suffride heere myche dissese,
and of tyrauntis that han prosperite in this lijf.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1736

And therfore Joob telde opinly hise goode dedis to coumforte him a+gens
dispeir, to whiche hise frendis wolden bringe him; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1737

but Joob dide this ouer myche, and with sum pride, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1738

and iustifiede himself ouer myche, that hise freendis conseyueden that
he blasfemyde God, and preuede God vnri+gtful; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1739

and of thes twey poyntis Joob repentide in the ende.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1740

Thanne God for+gaf to him this litil synne, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1741

and appreued his trewe sentense, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1742

and dampnede the errour of hise aduersaries.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1743

Thanne Job preiede, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1744

and made sacrifice for hise aduersaries, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1745

and God herde him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1746

and dide mercy to hem; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1747

and God addide alle thingis double, that Joob hadde; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1748

and he hadde xiiij. thousind of scheep, and vj. thousind
of camelis, and a thousind +gockis of oxen, and a thousind femal assis,
and vij. sones, and iij. dou+gtris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1749

and Joob lyuede vij. score +geer aftir his turment,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1750

and si+g hise sones and the sones of his sones til to the fourthe
generacoun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1751

This proces of Job schulde stire men to be iust of lyuyng, and to be
pacient in aduersitees, as Joob was, and to be stedfast in cristen feith,
and answere wijsely and meekly to eretikis and aduersaries of oure feith,
as Petir and Poul techen, and euere be meke and ful of charite, and preie
for oure enemyes, and looke aftir meede in heuene, and not in erthe,
for oure good deedis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1752

The Sautir comprehendith al the elde and newe testament,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,37.1753

and techith pleynly the mysteries of the Trinite, and of Cristis
incarnacoun, passioun, rising a+gen, stying in to heuene, and sending
doun of the Holy Gost, and preching of the gospel, and the coming of
Antecrist, and the general <P_I,38> dom of Crist, and the glorie of
chosen men to blisse, and the peynes of hem that schulen be dampned in
helle; CMPURVEY-M3,I,38.1754

and ofte rehersith the stories of the elde testament,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,38.1755

and bringith in keping of Goddis heestis, and loue of enemyes.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,38.1756

Noo book in the eld testament is hardere to vndirstonding to vs Latyns,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,38.1757

for oure lettre discordith myche fro the Ebreu, CMPURVEY-M3,I,38.1758

and many doctouris taken litel heede to the lettre, but al to the goostly
vndirstonding.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,38.1759

Wel <P_I,39> were him that koude wel vndirstonde the Sautir, and kepe
it in his lyuyng, and seie it deuoutly, and conuicte Jewis therbi;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,39.1760

for manye men that seyn it vndeuoutly, and lyuen out of charite, lyen
foule on hemself to God, CMPURVEY-M3,I,39.1761

and blasfemen hym, whanne thei crien it ful loude to mennis eeris in
the chirche.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,39.1762

Therfore God +geue grace to vs to lyue wel in charite, <P_I,40> and
sey it deuoutly, and vndirstonde it treuly, and to teche it opinly to
Cristen men and Jewis, and bringe hem therby to oure Cristen feith,
and brennynge charite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,40.1763

The Prouerbis either Parablis of Salamon teche men to lyue iustly to
God and man.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,40.1764

Ecclesiastes techith men to forsake and sette at nou+gt alle goodis in
the world, and to drede God, and kepe hise heestis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,40.1765

The Songis of Songis techen men to sette al hire herte in the loue of
God, and of hire nei+geboris, and trewe preching, and wilful suffring
of peyne and deth, if nede be.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,40.1766

Prouerbis speken myche of wijsedom and keping of Goddis heestis
, in comendinge trewe teching, and in repreuyng fals teching,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,40.1767

and Prouerbis treten mychel of ri+gtfulnesse, and iust domes and
gouernaunce, and of punysching of auoutrie and othere falsenessis
CMPURVEY-M3,I,40.1768

<P_I,41>

and comenden myche iust lordis and sogetis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1770

and repreuen strongly wrongful lordis and rebel sogettis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1771

Also Prouerbis techen derkly the mysteries of Crist, and of hooly chirche,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1772

and techen myche wijsdom and prudence, for the soule and the body.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1773

Therfore lordis, and iugis, and comuneris also, and namely prestis,
schulden stodie wel this book, and rule hemself therbi, to saluacoun of
body and of soule.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1774

Ecclesiastes is a ful sotil book, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1775

for Salamon spekith in many persones, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1776

and concludith her entent and sentence, not in appreuyng the sentence
of fleschly men, that preisen more bodily goodis and lustis of the body
than heuenly goodis and lyking of vertues, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1777

and dampneth many errours of worldly men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1778

and schewith that al is vanite, til me come to the drede of God, and
keeping of hise heestis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1779

Therfore men moten bee wel war hou thei vndirstonden Salamon in this
book, that thei appreue noon errour, and dampne noo treuthe, for
mysconseyuing of Salamonys wordis, and the Hooly Goostis wordis in
this book.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1780

The Songis of Songis touchen derkly the staat of the synagoge, fro
the gooing out of Egipt til to Cristis incarnacoun and passioun;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1781

and thanne tho Songis touchen the staat of Cristis chirche, and of the
synagoge in the ende of the world, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1782

and treetyn hi+gly of loue to God and nei+gebore also;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1783

and this book is so sotil to vndirstonde, that Jewis ordeyneden,
that no man schulde stodie it, no but he were of xxx. +geer,
and hadde able wit to vndirstonde the goostly preuytees of this book;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1784

for sum of the book seemith to fleschly men to sounne vnclene loue of
leccherie, where it tellith hi+g goostly loue, and greet preuytees of
Crist and of his chirche.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1785

Therfore men moten be ful wel war to conseyue wel the wordis of the Holy
Goost in this book, and knowe whanne Crist spekith to the chirche, either
to the synagoge, and whanne the synagoge spekith to God, and whanne the
chirche spekith to Crist, and whanne God spekith to aungels, patriarkis,
and prophetis, and apostlis, and whanne these persones speken to the
synagoge either to the chirche, either a+genward.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1786

The book of Wijsedam, thou+g it be not a book of bileeue, techith myche
ri+gtfulnesse, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1787

and preisith wysdom, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1788

and repreuith fleschly men for hire false bileeue and yuel lyuynge,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1789

and comendith myche iust men, sad in bileeue and vertuouse lyuynge,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1790

and touchith myche of Cristis incarnacoun, his manheed and godheed
togidere, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1791

and dampneth gretly idolatrie, and fals worschiping of idolis, and
false goddis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1792

Thou+g Ecclesiastici be no book of bileeue, it techith myche wisdom and
prudence for soule and body, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1793

and hath myche the sentence of Prouerbis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1794

and comaundith men to thenke and speke of Goddis heestis, and for to
dreede God, and loue him, and euere haue mynde of deth, and of the
greet dom, to kepe men out of synne, and in parfit loue to God and man.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1795

Also it preisith myche almes and good preier, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1796

and repreuith gretly extorcouns, and wrong, and false oothis, and
false mesuris, and false wey+gtis, and al fraude, preuy and apert;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1797

at the laste it comendith goode men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1798

and herieth God, that delyuereth fro alle perrelis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1799

If this book be wel vndirstonden, it is profitable bothe to
goostly gouernours and bodily lordis, and iustisis and comyns also.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1800

The Prophetis han a general prologe for alle, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1801

and for I declaride sumdel the grete profetis, and in party the litil
prophetis, and thenke soone to make an ende, with Goddis help, of the glos
on the smale prophetis, I thenke now to passe ouer withouten eny tarying.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1802

The firste book of Macabeis tellith hou gret distruccioun and cruelte
Antioke the noble dide a+gens the Jewis, and hou many thousindis he
killide of hem, that wolden holde Goddis lawe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1803

and defoulide the temple of Jerusalem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,41.1805

and compellide men, for drede of deth, <P_I,42> to do idolatrie, and

CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1812

And thei diden mychel harm to the puple of Israel, CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1813

and who euere heeld the bookis of Goddis testament and kepte his lawe,

hooly men bifore goyng; CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1841

and he ordeynede Judas Macabeus to be duk of bateil, CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1842

and ordeynede Symount his sone to be fadir and prest to hem,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1843

for he was a man of counceil.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1844

Thanne ben teld many batels of Judas Macabeus a+gens hethene men, and
of grete victories bi Goddis help.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1845

Thanne Judas Macabeus made frenschipe with Romayns, for hire prudence,
ri+gtfulnesse and power.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1846

And whanne Judas was deed in bateile, the peple ordeynede Jonathas,
his brother, prince and duyk, for to holde werre a+gens hethen men.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1847

Thanne ben teld many bateiles of Jonathas, and victories whiche he hadde
a+gens hethen men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1848

Thanne Jonatas, aftir manye victories, sente to renule frenschip
with Romayns, and with Sparciatis, that weren of the kyn of Jewis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1849

and Jonathas and hise sones weren slayn at the laste, bi tresoun of
Trifon, that was an hethene man, and my+gty duyk.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1850

Thanne Symount was maad duyk of the peple, and in the stede of Judas
Macabeus and of Jonatas; CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1851

and he dide manye bateiles and stronge, CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1852

and hadde greet victories a+gens hethene men; CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1853

and Jewis hadden myche reste vndir hym; CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1854

and he made stronge hooldis and citees in Juda, CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1855

and he renulide frenschipe with Romayns and Sparciatis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1856

and hadde myche glorie of his folc, and of hethene kingis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1857

At the laste Symount and his twey sones weren slayn bi tresoun,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1858

and Jon, his sone, was prince of prestis, aftir his fadir day,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1859

and dide many bateiles a+gens hethene men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1860

The ij. book of Macabeis tellith myche the same sentence of the
first book, CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1861

and hath a fewe special poyntis, of Elyodorus, of Eleasarus, and of the
noble wydue and hire vij. sones.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1862

Eliodorus was sent of the hethen king to take awey the tresouris of the
temple of Jerusalem, and bere tho to the king, CMPURVEY-M3,I,42.1863

and thou+g the tresouris weren kept for the lijflode of widewis and
fadirles children, and summe weren another mannis goodis, Elyodorus
wolde algate bere <P_I,43> al to the king; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1864

but God made hym and his felowis soore aferd, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1865

and Eliodorus was beten almest to the deth, of a ferdful oon sittinge
on a hors, that hadde twey +gunge men aboute him; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1866

and Eliodorus was cast doun to the grounde, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1867

and was born out on a bere, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1868

and lay domb.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1869

And whanne the hi+gest prest offride sacrifice, and preiede for the
helthe of Eliodorus, God grauntide lijf to him, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1870

and he thankide God, and the hi+gest prest, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1871

and +gede to the king CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1872

and tolde to him hou it stood; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1873

and he witnesside to alle men the grete werkis of God, whiche he hadde
seyn with hise i+gen.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1874

Thanne is toold of the curside deedis of Jason the prest, that cam in by
symonye, and wolde bringe Jewis to idolatrie and sodomye, and to forsake
God and his lawe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1875

Thanne is teld of greet cruelte of Antioke, whiche he dide a+gens the
Jewis and the hooly place of Jerusalem; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1876

and God suffride this for the synnes of the peple, for whi God chees not
the folc for the place, but the place for the folc.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1877

Thanne Eleasarus ches to di+ge a scharp deeth, rathere than he wolde breke
Goddis lawe in a litil poynt, to ete pork, +ghe, to feyne to ete pork.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1878

Aftir this it sueth hou the blissid widewe and hire vij. sones
were martiride, for thei nolden breke Goddis lawe, and hou gloriously
the blessid modir coumfortid hem to take deeth with ioie for the lawe
of God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1879

This storie and proces of Macabeis schulde stire cristen men to holde
Goddis lawe to lijf and deth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1880

and if kni+gtis schulden vse the swerd a+gens eny curside men, thei
schulden vse it a+gens lordis and prestis principaly, that wolen compelle
men, for drede of prisoun and deth, to forsake the treuthe and fredom
of Cristis gospel; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1881

but God for his greet mercy +geue very repentance to hem, that thus
pursuen trewe men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1882

and graunte pacience, meekenesse, and charite to hem that ben thus
pursued!  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1883

Amen.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1884

Cap. XII. CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1886

<$$heading>

But it is to wite that holy scripture hath iiij. vndirstondingis;
literal, allegorik, moral, and anagogik.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1888

The literal vndirstonding techith the thing don in deede;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1889

and literal vndir-stonding is ground and foundament of thre goostly
vndirstondingis, in so myche as Austyn, in his Pistle to Vincent, and
othere doctouris seyn, oonly bi the literal vndirstond-ing a man may
argue a+gens an aduersarie.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1890

Allegorik is a goostly vndirstonding, that techith what thing men owen
for to bileeue of Crist either of hooly chirche.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1891

Moral is a goostly vndirstonding, that techith men, what vertues thei
owen to sue, and what vices thei owen to flee.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1892

Anagogik is a goostly vndirstonding, that techith men, what blisse thei
schal haue in heuene.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1893

And these foure vndirstondingis moun be taken in this word Jeru-salem;
for whi to the literal vndirstonding it singnefieth an erthly citee,
as Loundoun, either such another; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1894

to allegorie it singnefieth hooly chirche in erthe, that fi+gtith a+gens
synnes and fendis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1895

to moral vndirstondinge it singnefieth a cristen soule;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1896

to anagogik it singnefieth hooly chirche regnynge in blisse either in
heuene, and tho that ben therinne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1897

And these thre goostly vndirstondingis ben not autentik either of beleeue,
no but tho ben groundid opynly in the text of holy scripture , in oo
place other other, either in opin resoun that may not be distroied, either
whanne the gospelris either other apostlis taken allegorie of the eelde
testament, and confeermyn it, as Poul in the pistle to Galat.
in iiij. c=o=. preveth, that Sara, the free wijf and
principal of Abraham, with Isaac hir sone, singne-fieth bi allegorie
the newe testament and the sones of biheeste; CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1898

and Agar, the hand mayde, with hir sone Ismael, signefieth bi allegorie
the elde testament, and fleschly men that schulen not be resseyued in to
the eritage of God with the sones of biheeste, that holden the treuthe
and freedom of Cristis gospel with endeles charite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,43.1899

Also holy scripture hath <P_I,44> many figuratif spechis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1900

and as Austyn seith in the iij. book Of Cristen Teching, that
autouris of hooly scripture vsiden moo figuris, that is, mo fyguratif
spechis, than gramariens moun gesse, that reden not tho figuris in
holy scripture.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1901

It is to be war in the bigynnyng, that we take not to the lettre a
figuratif speche, CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1902

for thanne, as Poul seith, the lettre sleeth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1903

but the spirit, that is, goostly vndirstonding, qwykeneth;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1904

for whanne a thing which is seid figuratifly is taken so as if it be
seid propirly, me vndirstondith fleschly; CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1905

and noon is clepid more couenably the deth of soule, than whanne
vndirstonding, that passith beestis, is maad soget to the fleisch in
suynge the lettre.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1906

What euer thing in Goddis word may not be referrid propirly to oneste
of vertues neither to the treuthe of feith, it is figuratyf speche.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1907

Onestee of vertues perteyneth to loue God and the nei+gebore;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1908

treuthe of feith perteyneth to knowe God and the nei+gebore.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1909

Hooly scripture comaundith no thing no but charite, CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1910

it blamith no thing no but coueitise; CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1911

and in that manere it enfoormeth the vertues either goode condiscouns
of men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1912

Holy scripture affermith no thing no but cristen feith bi thingis passid,
present, and to comynge, CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1913

and alle these thingis perteynen to nursche charite, and make it strong,
and to ouercome and quenche coueitise.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1914

Also it is figuratijf speche, where the wordis maken allegorie, ether
a derk lycnesse, either parabl, CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1915

and it is figuratyf speche in i. c. of Jeremye,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1916

"to day I have ordeyned thee on folkis and rewmys, that thou draw
up bi the roote, and distroie, and bylde, and plaunte;"that is, that
thou drawe out elde synnes, and distroie circumstaunces either causis
of thoo, and bylde vertues, and plaunte goode werkis and customys.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1917

Alle thingis in holy scripture, that seemyn to vnwijse men to be ful
of wickidnesse a+gens a man himself, either a+gens his nei+gebore ben
figuratyf spechis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1918

and the preuytees, either goostly vndirstondinges, schulden be sou+gt
out of vs, to the feeding either keping of charite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1919

Such a reule schal be kept in figuratif spechis, that so longe it be
turned in mynde bi diligent consideracioun, til the expownyng either
vndirstonding be brou+gt to the rewme of charite; CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1920

if eny speche of scripture sounneth propirly charite, it owith not to
be gessid a figuratif speche; CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1921

and for-beedith wickidnesse, either comaundith profyt either good doynge ,
it is no figuratyf speche; CMPURVEY-M3,I,44.1922

if it seemith to comaunde cruelte, either wickidnesse, either to
forbede prophit, <P_I,45> either good doinge, it is a figuratijf speche.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1923

Crist seith,"If +ge eten not the flesch of mannis sone and drinke not
his blood, +ge schulen not haue lijf in +gou. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1924

This speche semith to comaunde wickidnesse either cruelte,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1925

therfore it is a figuratif speche, CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1926

and comaundith men to comune with Cristis passioun, and to kepe in mynde
sweetly and pro-fitably, that Cristis flesch was woundid and crucified
for vs.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1927

Also whanne hooly scripture seith,"If thin enemy hungrith, feede thou
hym, if he thurstith, +geve thou drinke to hym,"it comaundith benefice,
either good doinge.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1928

whanne it seith,"thou schalt gadere togidere coolis on his
heed,"it seemith that wickidnesse of yuel wille is comaundid.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1929

This is seid bi figuratijf speche, that thou vndirstonde, that the coolys
of fijer ben brennynge weylyngis, either moornyngis of penaunce, bi whiche
the pride of hym is mad hool, which sorwith, that he was enemy of a man
that helpith and releuith his wrecchidnesse.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1930

Also the same word either the same thing in scripture is taken sumtyme
in good, and sumtyme in yuel, as a lyoun singnefieth sumtyme Crist,
and in another place it singnefieth the devyl.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1931

Also sour dou+g is set sumtyme in yuel, where Crist seith," be +ge war
of the sour dou+g of Farisees, which is ypocrisie; "CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1932

sour dou+g is sett also in good, whanne Crist seith,"the rewme of heuenes
is lyk sour dou+g,"etc. CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1933

And whanne not oo thing aloone but tweyne, either mo, ben feelid, either
vndirstonden, bi the same wordis of scripture, thou+g that it is hid,
that he vndirstond that wroot, it is no perel, if it may be prevyd
bi othir placis of hooly scripture, that ech of tho thingis acordith
with treuthe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1934

And in hap the autour of scripture seith thilk sentense in the same
wordis which we wolen vndirstonde; CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1935

and certys the Spirit of God, that wrou+gte these thingis bi the autour
of scripture, bifore si+g withoute doute, that thilke sentense schulde
come to the redere, either to the herere, CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1936

+ghe, the Holy Goost purueyde, that thilke sentence, for it is groundid
on trewthe, schulde come to the redere, either to the herere, for whi
what my+gte be purueyed of God largiliere and plentyuousliere in Goddis
spechis, than {it_might_be_purveyed} that the same wordis be vndirstonden
in manye maners, whiche maners, either wordis of God, that ben not of
lesse autorite, maken to be preued.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1937

Austin in iij. book of Cristen Teching seith al this and myche
more, in the bigynnyng therof.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,45.1938

Also he whos herte is ful of charite conprehendith, withouten eny errour
, the manyfoold abundaunce and largest teching of Goddis Scripturis ,
for whi Poul seith,"the fulnesse of lawe is charite,"and in another
place,"the ende of lawe,"that is, the perfeccioun, either <P_I,46>
filling, of the lawe,"is charite of clene herte, and of good conscience,
and of feith not feyned,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1939

and Jhesu Crist seith,"thou schalt love thi Lord God of al thin herte ,
and of al thi soule, and of al thi mynde, and thi nei+gebore as thi self,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1940

for in these twey comaunde-mentis hangith al the lawe and prophetis.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1941

And as the roote of alle yuels is coueitise, so the roote of alle goodis
is charitee.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1942

Charite, bi which we louen God and the nei+gebore, holdith sykirly al
the greetnesse and largnesse of Goddis spechis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1943

Therefore if it is not leisir to seeke alle holy scriptures, to expounne
alle the wlappingis of wordis, to perse alle the preuytes of scripturis ,
holde thou charite, where alle thingis hangen, so thou schalt holde that
that thou lernydist there; CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1944

also thou schalt holde that that thou lernedist not, CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1945

for if thou knowist charite, thou knowist sum thing wheronne also that
hangith that in hap thou knowist not; CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1946

and in that that thou vndirstondist in scripturis, charite is opin,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1947

and in that that thou vndirstondist not, charite is hid,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1948

therfore he that hooldith charite in vertues, either in goode condiscouns
, hooldith bothe that that is opyn and that that is hid in Goddis wordis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1949

Austyn seith al this and myche more in a sermoun of the preysing of
charite.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1950

Also vij. reulis of Tyconye and of Austyn declaren many derke
thingis of hooly scripturis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1951

The first reule is of Jhesu Crist, and of his holy spirit;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1952

oo persoone of the heed and of the body, that is, of Crist and of holy
chirche, is schewid to vs in this reule, CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1953

for it is not seid in veyn to feithful men,"+gee ben the seed of
Abraham,"whanne ther is oo seed of Abraham, which seed is Crist.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1954

Doute we not, whanne scripture goith fro the hed to the body, either
fro the body to the heed, and natheles it goith not awey fro oon and the
same persone, for whi oo persone spekith in Isaie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1955

"he settide a myter to me as to a spouse, CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1956

and he onouride me as a spousesse with an ournement. "
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1957

And natheles it is to vndirstonde what of these tweyne acoordith to the
heed, that is, Crist, and what acordith to the body, that is, hooly
chirche, for whi a myter acordith to Crist, which is the spouse, and
an ournement acordith to hooly chirche, which is the spouse of Crist.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1958

The secunde reule, as Ticonye seith, is of the bodi of Crist, which bodi
is departid into tweyne, CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1959

but ceertis this bodi of Crist ou+gte not be clepid so,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1960

for treuly it is not the bodi of Crist, which shal not be with him
withouten ende, CMPURVEY-M3,I,46.1961

but it schal be seid of the veri bodi and of the medlid body of Crist,
either of the veri bodi and feyned body of Crist; for whi ypocritis
schulen be seid to be not with Crist, not oonly withouten ende, but also
now, thou+g thei seemyn to be in the chirche of Crist.  Wherfor this reule
my+gt be clepid thus, <P_I,47> that it were seid of the medlid chirche,
that is, that conprehendith chosen men to blisse, and also ipocritis,
that schulen be dampned.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1962

And this reule axith a waking either diligent redere;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1963

whanne it spekith of other men, it semith to speke now as to the same
men to whiche it spac bifore, CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1964

either it seemith to speke of the same men, whanne it spekith of othere
men; as if oo body be of euer either, for temporal medlyng, and for
comynyng of sacramentis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1965

To this reule it perteyneth, that the chirche seith in Songis,"I am
blac and fair as the tabernaclis of Cedar, as the skynnes of Salomon;
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1966

the chirche seide that sche is euer either, for temporal vnite withinne
oo net of goode fischis and of yuel fischis; for whi the tabernaclis of
Cedar parteynen to Ismael, that schal not be eir with the sone of the
free wijf.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1967

The thridde reule is of byheestis and of lawe; CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1968

this reule may be seid also of the spirit and lettre;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1969

it may be seid also of grace and of comaundement; CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1970

and Tyconie erride in seyinge, that werkis ben +gouen of God to vs for
meryt of feith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1971

but feith it silf is so of vs, that it is not of God to vs.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1972

The iiij. reule is of al and of party, whanne summ of a thing is
set for al, eithir a+genward al is set for a party.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1973

The v. reule is of tymes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1974

and this is bi a figure clepid synodoches, whanne a part is set for al,
either al is set for oo part.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1975

Oon euangelist seith, that it was don aftir viij. daies, whanne
the face of Crist schynede as the sunne, CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1976

and another gospeler seide, that it was don aftir vj. daies;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1977

euer either my+gte not be soth, that is seid of the noumbre of daies,
no but he that seide aftir viij. daies be vndirstonden to haue
sett for the hool day the last part of the day, sithen Crist bifore seide
it to come, and to haue set for the hool day the first part of the day,
in whiche he schewith, that the appering of Cristis face was fully don;
and that he that seide aftir vj. daies, rekynede alle the hool
daies and the myddil daies, and noon other.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1978

Bi this kynde of speche, bi which kinde al is singnefied by a part,
thilk questioun of Cristis rising a+gen is asoiled; CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1979

the laste part of the day, wherinne Crist suffride deth, is taken for
al the day with the ny+gt passid bifore, CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1980

and the first part of Sunday, in whos morewitide he roos a+gen, is taken
for al Sunday and the ny+gt bifore goynge; CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1981

and the Sabot with the hool ny+gt bifore goynge is al hool day and ny+gt.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1982

If these ny+gtis and daies be not taken thus, ther moun not be iij.
daies and iij. ny+gtis, in whiche he bifore seide, that he schulde
be in the herte of erthe.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1983

Also this reule of tymes is taken for lawful noumbris, as ben vij.
x. and xij. and suche moo, CMPURVEY-M3,I,47.1984

for ofte suche noumbris ben sett for al tyme, as this that Dauith seith,
"seuen sithis in the day I seide preysing, either herying, to thee,
"is noon othir thing <P_I,48> than this,"his herying be euere in my
mouth. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1985

Also bi an c. and xliii. in Apoc. is singne-fied the
vniuersite, either al the multitude, of seintis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1986

The vi. reule is of recapitulacoun, either rehersing a thing don
bifore, not in ordre, as it is sett; for whi summe thingis ben seid so ,
as if tho suen in the ordre of tyme, either ben teld bi contynuyng of
thingis, that is, that ben ioyned next togidere, whanne the telling
is clepid a+gen preuyly to the formere thingis, that weren left out;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1987

and if men vndirstonden not such seying bi this reule, thei erren;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1988

as in Genesis it is seid,"God plauntide paradys in Eden, at the eest,
and settide there the man that he foormyde, and God brou+gte forth +git
of erthe ech fair tre,"etc.; this is seid bi recapitulacoun.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1989

In lyk maner there"the lond was of oo lippe,"that is, speche, it is seid
bi recapitulacoun.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1990

The vij. reule is of the deuel and of his bodi,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1991

for he is heed of alle wickide men, that ben his body in a manere, and
schulen go with him in to the turment of euerlasting fijer, as Crist is
the heed of hooly chirche, which is his body, and schal be with hym in
rewme and glorie euerlastinge.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1992

Also thei that haue lykinge for to studie in holy writ, schulen be
chargid, that thei kunne the kyndis and maners of spekingis in holy
scriptures; CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1993

and thei that perseyue diligently CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1994

and holde wel in mynde, hou a thing is wont to be seid in holy scripturis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1995

Also that is souereyn help and moost nedful, preie thei, that God +geue
to hem the veri vndirstonding of holy scripture, CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1996

for thei reden in tho scripturis, aboute whiche thei ben studiouse,
that God +geueth wisdom, and kunnyng, and vndirstonding of his face,
that is, +gifte and grace.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1997

Also if her stodie is don with meek-nesse, and loue of cristen lore,
it is of God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1998

Austyn writith al this in the iij. book of Cristen Teching,
aboute the myddil, and in the ende.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.1999

Isidre, in the j. book of Souereyn Good, touchith these reulis
schortliere, CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2000

but I haue hym not now, CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2001

and Lyre, in the bigyn-nyng of the bible, touchith more opinly these
reulis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2002

but I haue him not now, CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2003

and Ardma-can, in the bigynnyng of his book de Questionibus Armenorum,
+geueth many goode groundis to vndirstonde holy scripture to the lettre,
and goostly vndirstonding also, CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2004

but I haue him not now.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2005

Also no thing may seme to be wijsere, no thing of more eloquence, than
is hooly scripture, and the autours therof, that weren enspijrid of God.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2006

And thei ou+gten not to speke in other manere than {in} thei diden,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2007

and the prophetis, and moost Amos, weren ful eloquent,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2008

and seint Poul waas ful eloquent in his pistlis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,48.2009

Also the autouris of hooly scrip-ture spaken derkly, that the preuyteis
therof ben hid fro vnfeithful men, and goode men ben exercisid, either
ocupied, and that in expounnynge hooly scripture thei haue a newe <P_I,49>
grace, diuerse fro the first autouris.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2010

Austin, in the bigynnyng of the iiij. book of Cristen Teching.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2011

Also, as the litle richessis of Jewis, whiche thei baren awey fro
Egipt, weren in comparisoun of richessis which thei hadden aftirward in
Jerusalem, in the tyme of Salomon, so greet is the prophitable kunnynge
of filosoferis bookis, if it is comparisouned to the kunnynge of hooly
scripturis; for whi what euer thing a man lernith withouten hooly writ,
if the thing lerned is veyn, it is dampned in holy writ, if it is
prophitable, it is foundid there.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2012

And whanne a man fyndith theere alle thingis whiche he lernyde pro-fitably
in other place, he schal fynde myche more plenteuously tho thingis
in hooly scrip-ture, whiche he lernede neuere in other place, but ben
lerned oonly in the wondirful hi+gnesse and in the wondirful meeknesse
of hooly scripturis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2013

Austin seith this in the ende of ij. book of Cristen Teching.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2014

Also hooly scripture conteyneth al prophitable treuthe, and alle othere
sciencis preuyly in the vertu of wittis, either vndirstondingis, as wynes
ben conteyned in grapis, as ripe corn is conteyned in the seed, as bowis
ben conteyned in the rootis, and as trees ben conteyned in the kernels.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2015

Grostede, in a sermoun Premonitus a venerabili patre.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2016

Also hooly scripture wlatith sofymys, CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2017

and seith, he that spekith sofistic-aly, either bi sofymys, schal be
hatful, CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2018

and he schal be defraudid in ech thing, as the wijse man seith in
xxxvij. c. of Ecclesiastici.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2019

If filosoferis, and moost the disciplis of Plato, seiden eny treuthis ,
and prophitable to oure feith, not oonly tho treuthis owen not to be
dred, CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2020

but also tho schulen be calengid into oure vs, eithir profijt, fro hem,
as fro vniust possessouris.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2021

And as Jewis token, bi autorite of God, the gold, and syluer, and
clothis of Egipcyans, so cristene men owen to take the trewe seyingis of
filosoueris, for to worschippe oo God, and of techingis of vertues, whiche
treuthis the filosoueris founden not, but diggeden out of the metals of
Goddis puruyaunce, which is sched euery where.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2022

So dide Ciprian, the swettest doctour and moost blessid martir,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2023

so diden Lactancius, Victori-nus, and Illarie, and Greekis withoute
noumbre.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2024

Austin in ij. book of Cristen Teching.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2025

Bi these reulis of Austin and bi iiij. vndirstondingis of hooly
scripture, and bi wijs know-ing of figuratijf spechis, with good lyuynge
and meeknesse, and stodyinge of the bible, symple men moun sumdel
vndirstonde the text of holy writ, and edefie myche hemself and other
men; CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2026

but for Goddis loue, +ge symple men, be war of pride, and veyn iangling
and chyding in wordis a+gens proude clerkis of scole and veyn religions
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2027

and answere +gee mekely and prudently to enemyes of Goddis lawe,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2028

and preie +ge hertly for hem, that God of his greet mercy +geue
to hem very knowing of scripturis, and meekenesse, and charite,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2029

and euere be +ge redy, what euer man techith eny treuthe of God, to take
that meekely, and with greet thankingis to God; CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2030

and if eny man in erthe, either aungel of heuene, techith +gou the
contrarie of holy writ, either eny thing a+gens resoun and charite,
fle fro him in that, as fro the foul deuel of helle, CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2031

and holde +ge stedfastly to lijf and deeth the treuthe and freedom of
the hooly gospel of Jhesu Crist, CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2032

and take +ge mekely mennis seyingis and lawis, onely in as myche as thei
acorden with holy writ and good conscience, and noo ferther, for lijf
neither for deth.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,49.2033

<P_I,50>

Cap. XIII. CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2036

<$$heading>

Also holy scripture is betere knowen bi licnesses and bi derknessis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2038

it doth awey anoyes, CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2039

and we owe to thenke and bileeue, that the thing that is writen in
holy scripture, +ghe, thou+g it be hid, either not knowen, is betere
and trewere than that {that_it_is} we moun vndir-stonde bi vsself;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2040

and worschipfully and heelfully the holy Goost mesuride so holy
scrip-turis, that in opyn placis he settide remedie to oure hungir,
and in derk placis he wipte awey anoies; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2041

for almest no thing is seyn in tho derknessis, which thing is not founden
seid ful pleynly in other placis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2042

Therfore bifore alle thingis it is nedeful, that a man be conuertid bi
Goddis drede, and be mylde bi pite, either cristen religioun; and that he
a+gensie not hooly scripture, wher it be vnderstonden, thou+g it smyte eny
synnes of oure, whether it be not vndirstonden, as if we moun vndirstonde
betere, either comaunde, either teche betere.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2043

Be the +gifte of drede and of pitee, me comith to degre of kunnyng,
for whi ech fructuous man of hooly scripturis exercisith himself in this
thing , and to fynde noon other thing in tho, than for to loue God for God
himself, and for to loue his nei+gebore for God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2044

Thanne thilke drede, bi which he thenkith on Goddis dom, and thilke
pite, bi which he must nedis bileeue and +geue stide to autorite of
holy bookis, conpellith hym to beweyle hymself, for whi this kunnyng
of good hope makith a man not to auaunce himself, but biweile himself;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2045

and bi this affeccioun, either good wille, he geetith with besy
preieris the coumfort of Goddis help, that he be not broken bi dispeir ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2046

and he bigynneth to be in the fourthe degre of goostly strengthe, in
whiche he hungrith and thirstith ri+gtfulnesse; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2047

thanne in the v. degree, that is, in the counceyl of mercy, he
purgith the soule, that makith noise and vnrestfulnesse of coueitise of
erthly thingis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2048

and thanne he dispisith filthis of soule, CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2049

and louith God and nei+geboris, +ghe enemyes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2050

bi this he sti+gith to the vj. degre, where he purgith the i+ge of
soule, bi which i+ge God may be seyn, as myche as he may be seyn of hem
that di+gen to this world, as myche as thei mowen; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2051

for in so myche thei seen God in her soule, thour+g feith and loue,
hou myche thei di+gen to this world; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2052

and in as myche as thei leuyn to this world, thei seen not God;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2053

and in this degre, wherinne a man di+gith to the world, he neither
preferrith, neither makith euene himself, neither his nei+gebore, with
the treuthe of hooly writ; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2054

therfore this hooly man schal be so symple and clene of herte, that
neither for plesaunce of men he be drawe awey fro treuthe, nether bi
cause to eschewe eny harmys of himself, that ben contrarie to this lijf
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2055

such a chiild sti+gith to verey wis-dom, which is the laste and the
vij., which he vsith in pees and in reste.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2056

Seint Austyn seith al this in the bygynnyng of the ij. book of
Cristen Teching.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2057

Heere is a blissid entring bi these vij. vertues to the
kunnyng of holy scripture in this lifj, to haue here reste of soule,
and aftirward ful reste of bodi and soule in heuene, withouten ende.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2058

Alas!  what don proude and coueitouse wrecchis at hooly scripture,
that seeken the world and fleschly eese, and wolen not conuerten hem
fro these cursidnessis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2059

thei disseyuen hemself, and the puple that gessen hem wijse men, whanne
thei ben opyn foolis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2060

and maken hem-self deppere dampned, and other men also that suen her
folye, and blasfemyn God.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2061

Thes worldly foolis schulden wite, that hooly lijf is a launterne to
bringe a man to very kun-nynge, as Crisostom seith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2062

and the drede and love of God is the bigynning and perfeccioun of kunnyng
and wijsdom; CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2063

and whanne these fleschly apis and worldly moldewerpis han neither
the bigynnyng of wijsdom, neither desyren it, what doon thei at
hooly scripture, to schenschipe of hemself and of othere men?
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2064

As longe as pride and coveitise of worldly goodis and onouris is rootid
in her herte, thei maken omage to Satanas, CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2065

and offren to him bothe bodi and soule, and al her witt and fynding.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,50.2066

Such foolis schulden thenke, that <P_I,51> wijsedom schal not entre into
an yvel willid soule, neither schal dwelle in a body soget to synnes;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2067

and Jhesu Crist seith, that the fadir of heuene hijdith the prevytees
of hooly scripture fro wijse men and prudent, that is wijse men and
prudent to the world, and in her owne si+gt, and schewith tho to meke
men; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2068

therfore worldly foolis, do +ge first penaunce for +goure synnes, and
forsake pride and coveitise, and be +ge meke, and drede +ge God in alle
thingis, and love him over alle other thingis, and +goure nei+geboris
as +goure self; and thanne +ge schulen profite in stodie of hooly writ.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2069

But alas!  alas!  alas!  the moost abo-mynacoun that ever was herd
among cristen clerkis is now purposid in Yngelond, bi worldly clerkis
and feyned religiouse, and in the cheef universitee of oure reume,
as manye trewe men tellen with greet weylyng.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2070

This orrible and develis cursednesse is purposid of Cristis enemyes
and traytouris of alle cristen puple, that no man schal lerne dyuynite,
nei-ther hooly writ, no but he that hath doon his fourme in art, that
is, that hath comensid in art, and hath ben regent tweyne +geer aftir ;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2071

this wolde be ix. +geer either ten bifore that he lerne hooly
writ, aftir that he can comunly wel his gramer, thou+g he haue a good
witt, and traueile ful soore, and haue good fynding ix. either
x. +geer aftir his gramer.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2072

This semith vttirly the deuelis purpos, that fewe men either noon schulen
lerne and kunne Goddis lawe; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2073

But God seith bi Amos, on thre greete trespasis of Damask and on the
iiij.,"I schal not conuerte him;"where Jerom seith, the firste
synne is to thenke yuelis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2074

the ij. synne is to consente to weyward thou+gtis,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2075

the iij. synne is to fille in werk, CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2076

the iiij. synne is to do not penaunce aftir the synne, and to
plese himself in his synne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2077

But Damask is interpretid drinkynge blood, either birling blood.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2078

Lord!  whether Oxunford drinke blood and birlith blood, bi sleeinge
of quyke men, and bi doinge of sodomye, in leesinge a part of mannis
blood, wherbi a chijld myte be fourmed, deme thei that knowen;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2079

and wher Oxunforde drinke blood of synne, and stirith othere men of
the lond to do synne, bi boold-nesse off clerkis, deme thei iustly,
that seen it at i+ge, and knowen bi experiens.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2080

Loke now wher Oxunford is in thre orrible synnes and in the fourthe,
on which God restith not til he punsche it.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2081

Sumtyme children and +gunge men arsistris weren deuout and clene as
aungels, in comparisoun of othere; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2082

now men seyn thei ben ful of pride and leccherie, with dispitouse oothis,
needles and false, and dispising of Goddis heestis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2083

sumtyme cyvylians and canonistris weren deuout, and so bisy on her
lernyng, that they tooken ful litil reste of bed; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2084

now men seyn that thei ben ful of pride and nyce aray, enuye , and
coueitise, with leccherie, glotonie and ydilnesse; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2085

sumtyme dyuynys weren ful hooly and deuout, CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2086

and dispisiden outtirly the world, CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2087

and lyueden as aungels in meeknesse, clennesse, souereyn chastite,
and charite, CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2088

and tau+gten treuly Goddis lawe in werk and word; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2089

now men seyn, thei ben as deligat of hir mouth and wombe, and as
coueitouse as othere worldly men, and flateren, and maaken leesingis
in preching, to eschewe bodyly persecuscoun, and to gete benefices.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2090

The firste grete synne is generaly in the vniuersite, as men dreden and
seen at i+ge; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2091

the ij. orrible synne is sodomye and strong mayntenaunce thereof ,
as it is knowen to many persones of the reume, and at the laste parlement.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2092

Alas!  dyuynys, that schulden passe othere men in clennesse and
hoolynesse, as aungels of heuene passen freel men in vertues, ben moost
sclaundrid of this cursid synne a+gens kynde.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2093

The iij. orrible synne is symonie, and forswering in the semble
hous, that schulde be an hous of ri+gtfulnesse and hoolynesse, where
yuelis schulde be redressid; CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2094

this symonie with portenauncis thereof is myche worse and more abomynable
than bodily sodomye.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,51.2095

+Git on these thre abomynacouns God wolde graciously conuerte clerkis,
if thei wolden do very penaunce, and +geve hem hooliche <P_I,52> to
vertues; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2096

but on the iiij. most abomynacoun purposid now to letten
Cristen men, +ghe prestis and curatis, to lerne freely Goddis lawe,
til thei han spendid ix. +geer either x. at art, that
conprehendith many strong errouris of hethene men a+gens Cristen bileeue
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2097

it seemith wel that God wole not ceese of veniaunce, til it and othere
ben punschid soore; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2098

for it seemith that worldly clerkis and feyned relygiouse don this,
that symple men of wit and of fynding knowe not Goddis lawe, to preche
it generaly a+gens synnes in the reume.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2099

But wite +ge, worldly clerkis and feyned relygiouse, that God bothe can
and may, if it lykith hym, speede symple men out of the vniuersitee
, as myche to kunne hooly writ, as maistris in the vniuersite;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2100

and therfore no gret charge, thou+g never man of good wille be
poisend with hethen mennis errouris ix. +geer either ten,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2101

but euere lyue wel CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2102

and stodie hooly writ, bi elde doctouris and newe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2103

and preche treuly and freely a+gens opin synnes, to his deth.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2104

See therfore what Jerom seith on Amos, CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2105

God bifore seith yuels to comynge, that men heere, and amende hemself,
and be delyuered fro the perel nei+ginge, either if that thei dispisen,
thei ben punschid iustiliere; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2106

and God, that bifore seith peynes, wole not punsche men that synnen,
but that thei be amendid.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2107

Jerom seith this in the ende of the j. book of Amos.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2108

God, for His gret mercy, graunte that clerkis here the greet veniaunce
manasid of God, and amende hemself treuly, that God punsche not hem;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2109

for if thei amenden not hemself, thei ben eretikis maad hard in her
synnes; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2110

but see what Jerom seith a+gens ere-tikis, and in comendinge of hooly
scripture; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2111

he seith thus on Amos,"Eretikis that seruen the wombe and glotonye,
ben clepid ri+gtfully fattest kyin, either kyin ful of schenschipe.
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2112

"We owen to take hooly scripture on thre maneris; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2113

first, we owen vndirstonde it bi the lettre, and do alle thingis that
ben comaundid to vs therinne; the ij. tyme bi allegorie, that is,
goostly vndirstonding; and in the iij. tyme bi blisse of thingis
to comynge. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2114

Jerom seith this in the ij. book on Amos, and in iiij.
c. of Amos.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2115

Natheles for Lyre cam late to me, see what he seith of the vndirstonding
of holy scripture; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2116

he writith thus on the ij. prologe on the bible:"Joon
seith in v. c. of Apoc.'I sy+g a book written
withinne and withouteforth in the hond of the sittere on the trone;
'CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2117

this book is holy scripture, which is seid writen without forth, as to
the literal vndirstonding, and withinne, as to the preuy and goostly
vndirstonding;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2118

and in the j. prologe he declarith iiij. vndirstond-ingis
of hooly writ in this manere: CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2119

"Holy writ hath this specialte, that vndir oo lettre it conteyneth many
vndirstondingis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2120

for the principal autour of hooly writ is God himself, in whos power
it is, not oonly to vse wordis to singnifie a thing as men don,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2121

but also he vsith thingis singnefied bi wordis to singnefie other thingis
; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2122

therfore bi the singnyfying bi wordis is taken the literal vndirstonding,
either historial, of holy scripture, CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2123

and bi the singnefying which is maad bi thingis is taken the preuy,
either goostly vndirstonding, which is thre maneres, allegorik, moral,
either tropologik, and anogogik.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2124

If thingis singnefied bi wordis ben referrid to singnefie tho thingis
that owen to be bileeued in the newe testament, so it is taken the sense
of allegorik; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2125

if thingis ben referrid to singnefie tho thingis whiche we owen to do,
so it is moral sense, either tropologik; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2126

If thingis ben referrid to singnefie tho thingis that scholen be hopid
in blisse to comynge, so it is ana-gogik sense.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2127

The lettre techith what is doon; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2128

allegorie techith what thou owist for to bileeue; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2129

moral techith what thou owist for to do; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2130

anagogic techith whedir thou owist to go; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2131

and of these iiij. sensis, either vndirstondingis, may be set
ensaumple in this word Jerusalem; CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2132

for bi the literal vndirstonding Jerusalem singnefieth a cyte, that was
sumtyme the cheef citee in the rewme of Jude, CMPURVEY-M3,I,52.2133

and Jerusalem was foundid first of <P_I,53> Mel-chisedech,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2134

and aftirward it was alargid, and maad strong bi Salomon;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2135

bi moral sense it singnefieth a feithful soule, bi which sense it is
seid in lij. c. of Isaie,'rise thou, rise thou, sette
thou Jerusalem;'CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2136

bi sense allegorik it singnefieth the chirche fi+gtinge a+gens synnes
and feendis, bi which sense it is seid in xxj. c. of
Apoc.,'I si+g the hooly citee newe Jerusalem comynge doun fro
heuene, as a spouse ourned to hire housbonde;'CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2137

bi sence anagogik it singnefieth the chirche rengninge in blisse,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2138

bi this sence it is seid in iiij. c. to Galat. '
thilke Jerusalem which is aboue, which is oure modir, is free;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2139

and as en-saumple is set in oo word, so it might be set in oo resoun,
and as in oon, so and in othere. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2140

CAP. XIV. CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2143

<$$heading>

Natheles alle goostly vndirstondinges setten bifore, eithir requyren,
the literal vndir-stonding, as the foundement; wherfore as a bylding
bowing awey from the foundement is disposid to falling, so a goostly
expociscoun, that discordith fro the literal sense, owith to be arettid
vnseemely and vncouenable, either lesse seemely, and lesse couenable;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2145

and ther-fore it is nedful to hem, that wolen profite in the stodie of
holy scripture, to bigynne at the vndirstonding of literal sence, moost
sithen bi the literal sense aloone, and not bi goostly sencis may be maad
an argument, either preef, to the preuyng, either declaring , of a doute,
as Austin seith in his Pistle to Vincent Donatiste.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2146

Seint Isidre, in the firste book of Souereyn Good xx.
c. settith vij. reulis to expounne hooly scripture,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2147

and summe clepen these reulis the keies of scripture,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2148

for bi these rulis the vndirstonding of scripture is openid in many
thingis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2149

The firste reule is of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and of his goostly body ,
which is holy chirche, for whi for the knytting togidrere of the heed to
the body hooly scripture spekith sumtyme of euer either vndir oo resoun,
as vndir oo persone, and passith fro oon to anothir, CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2150

in ensaumple in lxj. c=o=. of Isaie it is seid,"He clothide
me with clothis of helthe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2151

and he compasside me with clothing of ri+gtfulnesse, as a spouse maad
fair with a coroune, and as a spousesse ourned with hire brochis;"
for whi this that is seid"as a spouse,"etc. is vndirstonden of
Crist, and this that sueth"as a spousesse"etc. is vndir-stonden
of holy chirche.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2152

Also in the j. c. of Songis it is seid,"Kisse he me with
the cosse of his mouth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2153

for thi tetis ben betere than wyn;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2154

for whanne it is seid,"kisse he me"etc., it is the word of the
spousesse desiringe to haue the spouse; CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2155

and this that sueth,"for thi tetis,"etc. is the word of the spouse,
preising the spousesse; wherfore in such thingis, knyt so togidere bi
resoun biforeseid, a prudent redere owith to perseyue what accordith to
the heed, and what to the body.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2156

The ij. reule is of the very body and of the feyned body of
oure Lord Jhesu Crist, for whi hooly chriche, which is the goostly
body of Crist, is a nett which is not drawen +git to the brinke;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2157

therfor it hath yuele men meddlid with goode men til to the doom, in
whiche these schulen be departid fro hem, CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2158

and ther-fore in holy scripture yuele men ben preisid sumtyme
with goode men, with whiche thei ben medlid; as in the xj.
c. of Osee God seith thus,"Israel is a chijld, and I louede him;
"CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2159

and a+genward sumtyme goode men ben blamed with yuel men, as in j.
c=o=. of Isaie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2160

"An oxe knew his lord CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2161

and an asse knew the cracche of his lord, CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2162

but Israel knew not me CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2163

and my puple vndirstood not;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2164

and sumtyme in the same resoun it is expressid what perteyneth to goode
men and what to yuele men, as in j. c=o=. of Songis it is
seid,"I am blac but fair, +ge dou+gtris of Jerusalem, as the tabernaclis
of Cedar, as the skynnes of Salamon;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2165

these ben the wordis of the spousesse, which for resoun of yuel men
conteyned in the chirche, seith,"I am blac,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2166

but for resoun of goode men it addith,"but fair;" CMPURVEY-M3,I,53.2167

and <P_I,54> this that sueth, as for ensaumple,"as the tabernaclis of
Cedar,"is referrid to yuele men; for whi Cedar was the sone of Ysmael,
as it is seid in xxv. c=o=. of Genesis, of whom Sara-cenus
camen forth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2168

and this that is addid,"as the skynnes of Salamon,"is referrid to
goode men.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2169

Therfore bi Salamon here is vndirstonden God himself, bi cristen
expocitouris and Ebreies; CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2170

and therfore the skynnes of Salamon ben seid tho with which the
tabernacle was heelid, in which tabernacle goode men worschipiden God.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2171

The iij. reule is of the spirit and of the lettre;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2172

this reule is expounned thus comunly, that the historial, either
literal sense, and the mystik, either goostly sense, is taken vndir
the same lettre, for whi the treuthe of the storie schal be holden,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2173

and natheles it schal be referrid to the goostly vndirstonding.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2174

This reule may be expounned also in another manere, that it be referrid
oonly to the literal sense, as othere reulis ben; aboute which thing it
is to see, that the same lettere hath sum tyme double literal sense ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2175

in ensaumple in j. book of Paralypomy-non, xvij.
c=o=., God seith to Salamon,"I schal be to him in to a fadir ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2176

and he schal be to me into a sone;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2177

and this to the lettere is vndirstonden of Salomon, in as myche as
he was the sone of God, bi grace in +gungthe, wherfore Nathan the
prophete clepide hym,"amyable to the Lord"in ij. book of Kingis,
xij. c.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2178

Also the forseid autorite,"I schal be to hym in to a fadir," etc.
is brou+gt in of Poul in j. c=o=. to Ebreis, as seid to
the lettre of Crist himself, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2179

and this is opyn bi this, that Poul bringith it in to preue, that Crist
is more than aungels; CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2180

but such preuynge may not be maad bi goostly sense, as Austin seith
a+gens Vincent Donatiste; CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2181

forsothe the forseid autorite was fillid to the lettre in Salomon,
natheles lesse parfitly, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2182

for he was the sone of God oonly bi grace, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2183

but it was fillid parfitlier in Crist, that was the sone of God bi kinde;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2184

but natheles euer either expocisscioun is literal outtirly.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2185

Natheles the ij. expociscoun, which is of Crist, is goostly and
preuy in sum maner, in as myche as Salamon was the figure of Crist.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2186

The iiij. reule is of al and of part, for whi scripture passith
fro oon to the tothere, and a+genward, as in xiij. c=o=.
of Isaie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2187

the scripture spekith first a+gens Babilone specialy, whanne it is seid,
"the birthen of Babi-lone,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2188

and thanne the scripture passith to vndirstonde the word generaly of al
the world, bi this that sueth, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2189

"the Lord cometh fro the hy+gnesse of heuene, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2190

and the vessels of his stronge veniaunce comen, that he distroie all
erthe;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2191

aftirward the scripture turneth a+gen to speke a+gens Babilone specialy ,
whanne it is seid,"Lo!  I schal rise on +gou Medeys, that schul not seeke
syluer;"for whi Darius Medey, with Cirus, his cosyn, took Babilone, and
killide Baltasar, the king of Babilone, as it is seid in the v.
c=o=. of Daniel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2192

The v. reule is of tymes, which reule bifallith in iiij.
maners; CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2193

in oo manere bi a figure clepid synodoches, whanne a part of tyme is
set for al the tyme, as it is seid in the gospel, that Crist lay thre
daies in the sepulcre, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2194

and natheles the first day and the thridde weren not hool daies.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2195

In another maner this reule bifallith for smale partys of tyme,
that ben noumbrid sumtyme in scripture, and sumtyme ben left out,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2196

and bi this the scripture that spekith of sum noumbre of +geris, in manye
placis, settith sumtyme moo +geris, rekenynge the forseid smale partys,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2197

in another place it settith fewere +geeris, in leuyng out the smale
partys.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2198

In iij. maner this reule bifallith, for that the rekenyng of
+geeris bigynneth in oo place at the formere terme, and in another
place at the latter teerme, as in xv. c=o=. of Genesis,
it was said to Abraham, that his seed schal be a pilgrym bi iiij.
c. +geer, and in xij. c=o=. of Exodi it is seid
of this pilgrimage, that the dwelling of the sones of Israel in the
lond of Egipt was of iiij. c. +geer and xxx.,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2199

for the rekenyng of this more noumbre bigynneth at the tyme, in which
it was seid to Abraham in xij. c=o=. of Genesis,"go out
of thi lond,"etc., CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2200

and the rekenyng of the lesse noumbre bigynneth at the natyuite of Isaac
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,54.2201

that was xxx. +geer aftir the goinge out <P_I,55> of Abraham
fro Aran.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2202

The iiij. tyme this reule bifallith, for that hooly scripture
spekith of thing to comynge bi the maner of thing passid, as in the
ix. c=o=. of Isaie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2203

"a litil child was born to vs,"etc.; CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2204

and this is to singnefie the certeynte of profecie, whos bifalling of tyme
to comynge is so certeyn, as if it were passid now; CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2205

and this is for certeynte of Goddis bifore knowing, bi whiche the
reuelacoun is maad to the prophete.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2206

Natheles such maner of speche hath noo place, no but in profecie
of predestynacoun, either ful determynyng of God; which prophecie is,
whanne a thing to comyng in noun certeyn to mannis knowing, is schewid
to the prophete in that maner, bi which it is in the bifore knowing of
God, which bifore knowing of God bihooldith so without fayling thingis
to comynge, as thingis present and passid.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2207

But in profecie of manaasinge, such maner of speech hath noo place,
which profecie of manaas is, whanne eny peyne worthi to be brou+gt in on
a puple, either on a persoone, is schewid to the prophete, not bi that
that it is in the bifore knowing of God, but bi the ordre of secunde
causis, as bi the yuel disseryungis of men; as is thilke prophecie of
Jonas iij. c=o=.,"+Git xl. daies, and Nynyue schal
be distroied;"for whi the synnes of that citee hadden disseryud this
distroying; CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2208

natheles for such a cause is chaung-able, therfore sumtyme the effect,
that is, peyne manaasid, sueth not, as heere, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2209

for Nyny-uytis diden penaunce, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2210

and so the Lord brou+gte not in the peyne manaasid.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2211

The vj. reule is of recapitulacoun, that is, rehersing of thing
don bifore, and of anticipacoun, either bifore takinge, that is, setting
in of thing bifore that it is don; CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2212

for in hooly scripture not euere stories and deedis ben writen in the
same ordre in whiche thoo ben don, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2213

and therfore whanne lattere thingis ben sett bifore, it is seid
anticipacioun, either byfore taking, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2214

and whanne the formere thingis ben set byhynde, it is seid recapitulacoun
, either rehersing of thing doon bifore, as in x. c=o=.
of Genesis it is seid of the sones of Noe,"the ilis of hethene folkis
in her cuntrees weren departid of these sones of Noe, ech man bi his
langage;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2215

and withinne in the same x. c=o=. it is seid,"these ben
the sones of Cham, in kynredis and langagis,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2216

and aftirward it is seid in xj. c=o=.,"the lond was of
oo langage and of the same wordis;"wherof it is opin, that this that
is bifore seid of the departyng of langagis, is seid bi anticipacoun;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2217

in lyk maner in ij. c=o=. of Genesis, aftir that Moises
in j. c=o=. hadde discriued the creacoun, either making
of nou+gt of heuene and of erthe, and the departing and ournyng of the
world, he seide,"these ben the generacouns of heuene and of erthe,
in the day in whiche tho weren mad;"wherof it is opin that this
is seid bi recapitulacoun, either rehersing of thing don bifore.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2218

The vij. reule is of the deuil and of his body,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2219

for as Gregori seith in the x. Omelie,"Certys the deuil is heed
of alle wickid men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2220

and alle wickide men ben membris of this heed,"CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2221

and therfore for the knytting togidere of the heed to the membris, the
scripture that spekith of oon, passith in the same knytting to-gidere
of resoun to speke of the tother, as in xiiij. c=o=. of
Isaie, where the scripture spekith of the king of Babilone, that was
a membre of the deuil, it passith to speke of the prince of fendis,
whanne it is seid there,"Lucifer, that rysidist eerly, hou feldist thou
doun fro heuene;"CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2222

and in the xxviij. c. of Ezechiel, where the scripture
spekith of the prince of Tire, it passith to speke of the deuil, whanne
it is addid,"thou, a singnet, either a prente, of the licnesse of God,
were ful of wisdom, and parfit in fairnesse, in the delices of paradys
of God. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2223

Lyre seith al this in the ij. prologe of Genesis.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2224

Heere Lire re-hersith the sentence of seint Austyn, and of Isidre in
these reulis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2225

and declarith hem opinly bi holy scripture and resoun,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2226

and countrith not Austin, CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2227

but declareth him ful mychel to symple mennis witt; CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2228

and addith more bi scripture and resoun, that Austin touchith not.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,55.2229

<P_I,56>

Thou+g these reulis either keies of scripture bringen men to greet
vndirstonding thereof, +git men moten taken heede, what is seid of Crist
bi his godheed, and what bi his manheed, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2231

for Crist bi his manheed, is seid lesse than the fadir,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2232

and bi the godheed he is seid euene with the fadir; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2233

and for as myche as Crist is bothe God and man, we graunten that God
is deedly, and di+gede on the crosse, not bi his godheed, but bi the
manheed of Crist, that was ioyned in oonhed of persone with the godheed
, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2234

and we graunte, as the gospel doith, that man, while he was deedly on
erthe, was in heuene, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2235

for his godheed was there, and he also bi resoun therof.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2236

Also we moun graunte wel, that a man made heuene and erthe,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2237

for Crist bi his godheed, which Crist is and was man, dide thus.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2238

Also hooly scripture tellith ofte the thou+gtis of men, and ofte the
wordis and deedis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2239

and whanne the thou+gtis, and wordis, and deedis of men ben contrarie,
oo gospeller tellith the thou+gtis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2240

and another tellith the wrdis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2241

and bi this eguiuocacoun, either diuerse speking, thei ben acordid,
+ghe, whanne thei seemen contrarie in wordis; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2242

also ofte in storial mateer scripture rehersith the comune opynyoun of
men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2243

and affirmeth not, that it was so in dede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2244

In this maner the gospel seith, that Joseph was the fadir of Crist,
thou+g he neuere gendride Crist; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2245

for Marie, Cristis modir, was euere clene virgyne.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2246

Thus the gospel seith, that at the biheeding of Joon Baptist, Eroude
was soory, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2247

and +git, as doctouris seyn, he was ful glad thereof;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2248

but he feynede him sory for the puple, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2249

and the puple gessid him sory.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2250

Also thou+g scripture rehersith, hou hooly men lyueden, and comendith
hem greetly, it appreueth not alle hire deedis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2251

for many greete seyntis erriden foule in manye poyntis;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2252

and thou+g scripture tellith the stories of yuel men and dampned
, it repreuith not herfore alle thingis whiche thei diden,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2253

for thou+g thei weren hemsilf ful cursid, thei diden many goode deedis
of kynde, and sumtyme perauenture goode dedis of vertu, if thei weren
in grace for a tyme.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2254

At the laste take +ge good heede, whanne scripture spekith bi comaundement
to all men, and whanne it +geueth comaundement to certeyn persones of
diuerse statis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2255

In the first poynt, alle men moten do, as it seith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2256

in the ij. tyme, the persoones of staatis specified moten nedis
obeye; CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2257

whanne scripture speketh oonly bi counceil, men moun be sauid, thou+g
thei do not the counceil, as ful many men and wymmen moun be sauid,
thou+g thei take not virginite, neither contynence, neither +geuen alle
her goodis to pore men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2258

and +git these ben heere counceils of Jhesu Crist in the gospel.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2259

CAP. XV..  CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2261

<$$heading>

For as myche as Crist seith that the gospel shal be prechid in al the
world, and Dauith seith of the postlis and her preching,"the soun of
hem +gede out into ech lond, and the wordis of hem +geden out into the
endis of the world,"and eft Dauith seith,"the Lord schal telle in the
scripturis of puplis, and of these princis that weren in it,"that is,
in holi chirche, and as Jerom seith on that vers, "hooly writ is the
scripture of puplis, for it is"maad, that alle puples schulden knowe
it,"and the princis of the chirche, that weren therinne, ben the postlis,
that hadden autorite to writen hooly writ, for bi that same that the
postlis writiden her scripturis bi autorite , and confermynge of the
Hooly Goost, it is hooly scripture, and feith of cristen men, and this
dignite hath noo man aftir hem, be he neuere so hooly, neuer so kunnynge,
as Jerom witnessith on that vers.  Also Crist seith of the Jewis that
crieden Osanna to him in the temple, that thou+g thei weren stille
stoonis schulen crie, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2263

and bi stoonis he vndirstondith hethen men, that worshipiden stoonis

And we Englische men ben comen of hethen men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,56.2265

therfore we ben vndirstonden bi thes stonis, that schulden crie hooly

and as Jewis, interpretid knowlechinge, singnefien clerkis, that schulden
knouleche to God, bi repentaunce of synnes, and bi vois <P_I,57> of
goddis heriyng, so oure lewide men, suynge the corner ston Crist, mowen
be singnefied bi stonis, that ben harde and abydinge in the foundement;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2267

for thou+g couetouse clerkis ben woode by simonie, eresie, and manye
othere synnes, and dispisen and stoppen holi writ, as myche as thei moun,

with greet cost and peril of here lif.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2268

For these resons and othere, with comune charite to saue alle men in
oure rewme, whiche God wole haue sauid, a symple creature hath translatid
the bible out of Latyn into English.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2269

First, this symple creature hadde myche trauaile, with diuerse felawis and

First it is to knowe, that the best translating is out of Latyn into
English, to translate aftir the sentence, and not oneli aftir the wordis,
so that the sentence be as opin, either openere, in English as in Latyn,
and go not fer fro the lettre; CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2271

and if the lettre mai not be suid in the translating, let the sentence
euere be hool and open, CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2272

for the wordis owen to serue to the entent and sentence,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2273

and ellis the wordis ben superflu either false.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2274

In translating into English, manie resolucions moun make the sentence
open, as an ablatif case absolute may be resoluid into these thre wordis,
with couenable verbe, the while, for, if, as gramariens seyn; as thus,
the maistir redinge, I stonde, mai be resoluid thus , while the maistir
redith, I stonde, either if the maistir redith, etc. either for
the maistir, etc.; CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2275

and sumtyme it wolde acorde wel with the sentence to be resoluid into
whanne, either into aftirward, thus, whanne the maistir red, I stood,
either aftir the maistir red, I stood; CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2276

and sumtyme it mai wel be resoluid into a verbe of the same tens, as
othere ben in the same resoun, and into this word et, that is, and in
English, as thus, CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2277

arescentibus hominibus prae timore, that is, and men shulen wexe drie
for drede.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2278

Also a participle of a present tens, either preterit, of actif vois,
eithir passif, mai be resoluid into a verbe of the same tens, and
a coniunccioun copulatif, as thus, dicens, that is, seiynge, mai be
resoluid thus, and seith, eithir that seith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2279

and this wole, in manie placis, make the sentence open, where to Englisshe
it aftir the word, wolde be derk and douteful.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2280

Also a relatif, which mai be resoluid into his antecedent with a
coniunccioun copulatif, as thus, which renneth, and he renneth.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2281

Also whanne oo word is oonis set in a reesoun, it mai be set forth as
ofte as it is vndurstonden, either as ofte as reesoun and nede axen;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2282

and this word autem, either vero, mai stonde for forsothe, either for
but, CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2283

and thus I vse comounli; CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2284

aud sumtyme it mai stonde for and, as elde gramariens seyn.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2285

Also whanne ri+gtful construccioun is lettid bi relacion, I resolue it
openli, thus, where this reesoun, Dominum formidabunt adversarij ejus
, shulde be Englisshid thus bi the lettre, the Lord hise aduersaries
shulen drede, I Englishe it thus bi resolucioun, the aduersaries of
the Lord shulen drede him; and so of othere resons that ben like.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2286

At the bigynning I purposide, with Goddis helpe, to make the sentence
as trewe and open in English as it is in Latyn, either more trewe and
more open than it is in Latyn; CMPURVEY-M3,I,57.2287

and I preie, for charite and for comoun profyt of cristene soulis,
that if ony wiys man fynde ony defaute of the truthe of translacioun,
let him sette in the trewe sentence and opin of holi writ, but loke that
he <P_I,58> examyne truli his Latyn bible, CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2288

for no doute he shal fynde ful manye biblis in Latyn ful false, if he
loke manie, nameli newe; CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2289

and the comune Latyn biblis han more nede to be correctid, as manie
as I haue seen in my lif, than hath the English bible late translatid;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2290

and where the Ebru, bi witnesse of Jerom, of Lire, and othere expositouris
discordith fro oure Latyn biblis, I haue set in the margyn , bi maner
of a glose, what the Ebru hath, and hou it is vndurstondun in sum place;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2291

and I dide this most in the Sauter, that of alle oure bokis discordith
most fro Ebru; CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2292

for the chirche redith not the Sauter bi the laste translacioun of
Jerom out of Ebru into Latyn, but another translacioun of othere men
, that hadden myche lasse kunnyng and holynesse than Jerom hadde;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2293

and in ful fewe bokis the chirche redith the translacioun of Jerom, as
it mai be preuid bi the propre origynals of Jerom, whiche he gloside.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2294

And where I haue translatid as opinli or opinliere in English as in
Latyn , late wise men deme, that knowen wel bothe langagis, and knowen
wel the sentence of holi scripture.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2295

And wher I haue do thus, or nay, ne doute, thei that kunne wel the
sentence of holi writ and English togidere, and wolen trauaile, with
Goddis grace, theraboute, moun make the bible as trewe and as opin,
+gea, and opinliere in English than it is in Latyn.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2296

And no doute to a symple man, with Goddis grace and greet trauail, men
mi+gten expoune myche openliere and shortliere the bible in English , than
the elde greete doctouris han expounid it in Latyn, and myche sharpliere
and groundliere than manie late postillatouris, eithir expositouris,
han don.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2297

But God, of his grete marci, +geue to vs grace to lyue wel, and to seie
the truthe in couenable manere, and acceptable to God and his puple,
and to spille not oure tyme, be it short be it long at Goddis ordynaunce.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2298

But summe, that semen wise and holi, seyn thus, CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2299

if men now weren as holi as Jerom was, thei mi+gten translate out of
Latyn into English, as he dide out of Ebru and out of Greek into Latyn ,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2300

and ellis thei shulden not translate now, as hem thinkith, for defaute
of holynesse and of kunnyng.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2301

Thou+g this replicacioun seme colourable, it hath no good ground, neither
resoun, neithir charite, for whi this replicacioun is more a+gens seynt
Jerom, and a+gens the firste lxx. translatouris, and a+gens
holi chirche, than a+gens symple men, that translaten now into English;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2302

for seynt Jerom was not so holi as the apostlis and euangelistis, whos
bokis he translatide into Latyn, CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2303

neither he hadde so hi+ge +giftis of the Holi Gost as thei hadden;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2304

and myche more the lxx. translatouris weren not so holi as Moises
and the profetis, and speciali Dauith, CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2305

neither thei hadden so greete +giftis of God, as, Moises and the
prophetis hadden.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2306

Ferthermore holi chirche appreueth, not oneli the trewe translacioun
of meene cristene men, stidefast in cristene feith, but also of open
eretikis, that diden awei manie mysteries of Jhesu Crist bi gileful
translacioun, as Jerom witnessith in oo prolog on Job, and in the prolog
of Daniel.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2307

Myche more late the chirche of Engelond appreue the trewe and hool
translacioun of symple men, that wolden for no good in erthe, bi here
witing and power, putte awei the leste truthe, +gea, the leste lettre
, either title, of holi writ, that berith substaunce, either charge.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2308

And dispute thei not of the holynesse of men now lyuynge in this deadli
lif, CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2309

for thei kunnen not theron, CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2310

and it is reseruid oneli to Goddis doom.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2311

If thei knowen ony notable defaute bi the translatouris, either
helpis of hem, lete hem blame the defaute bi charite and merci,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2312

and lete hem neuere dampne a thing that mai be don lefulli be Goddis lawe,
as weeryng of a good cloth for a tyme, either riding on an hors for greet
iourney, whanne thei witen not wherfore it is don; CMPURVEY-M3,I,58.2313

for suche thingis moun be don of symple men, with as greet charite and
vertu, as <P_I,59> {with} summe, that holden hem greete and wise, kunnen
ride in a gilt sadil, either vse cuyssyns and beddis and clothis of gold
and of silk, with othere vanitees of the world.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2314

God graunte pite, merci, and charite, and loue of comoun profyt,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2315

and putte awei such foli domis, that ben a+gens resoun and charite.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2316

+Git worldli clerkis axen gretli what spiryt makith idiotis hardi to
translate now the bible into English, sithen the foure greete doctouris
dursten neuere do this?  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2317

This replicacioun is so lewid, that it nedith noon answer, no but
stillnesse, eithir curteys scorn; CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2318

for these greete doctouris weren noon English men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2319

neither thei weren conuersaunt among English men, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2320

neithir in caas thei kouden the langage of English, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2321

but thei ceessiden neuere til thei hadden holi writ in here modir tunge,
of here owne puple.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2322

For Jerom, that was a Latyn man of birthe, translatide the bible, bothe
out of Ebru and out of Greek, into Latyn, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2323

and expounide ful myche therto; CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2324

and Austyn, and manie mo Latyns expouniden the bible, for manie partis,
in Latyn, to Latyn men, among whiche thei dwelliden, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2325

and Latyn was a comoun langage to here puple aboute Rome, and bi+gondis
, and on this half, as Englishe is comoun langage to oure puple,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2326

and +git this day the comoun puple in Italie spekith Latyn corrupt,
as trewe men seyn, that han ben in Italie; CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2327

and the noumbre of translatouris out of Greek into Latyn passith mannis
knowing, as Austyn witnessith in the ij. book of Cristene Teching ,
and seith thus,"the translatouris out of Ebru into Greek moun be noumbrid,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2328

but Latyn translatouris, either thei that translatiden into Latyn,
moun not be noumbrid in ony manere. "CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2329

For in the firste tymes of feith, ech man, as a Greek book came to him
, and he semyde to him silf to haue sum kunnyng of Greek and of Latyn,
was hardi to translate; CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2330

and this thing helpide more than lettide vndurstonding, if rederis ben
not necligent, forwhi the biholding of manie bokis hath shewid ofte,
eithir declarid, summe derkere sentencis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2331

This seith Austyn there.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2332

Therfore Grosted seith, that it was Goddis wille, that diuerse
men translatiden, and that diuerse translacions be in the chirche,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2333

for where oon seide derkli, oon either mo seiden openli.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2334

Lord God!  sithen at the bigynnyng of feith so manie man translatiden into
Latyn, and to greet profyt of Latyn men, lat oo symple creature of God
translate into English, for profyt of English men; CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2335

for if worldli clerkis loken wel here croniclis and bokis, thei shulden
fynde, that Bede translatide the bible, and expounide myche in Saxon,
that was English, either comoun langage of this lond, in his tyme;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2336

and not oneli Bede, but also king Alured, that foundide Oxenford,
translatide in hise laste daies the bigynning of the Sauter into Saxon,
and wolde more, if he hadde lyued lengere.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2337

Also Frenshe men, Beemers, and Britons han the bible, and othere bokis
of deuocioun and of exposicioun, translatid in here modir langage;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2338

whi shulden not English men haue the same in here modir langage, I
can not wite, no but for falsnesse and necgligence of clerkis, either
for oure puple is not worthi to haue so greet grace and +gifte of God,
in peyne of here olde synnes.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2339

God for his merci amende these euele causis, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2340

and make oure puple to haue, and kunne, and kepe truli holi writ, to
lijf and deth!  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2341

But in translating of wordis equiuok, that is, that hath
manie significacions vndur oo lettre, mai li+gtli be pereil,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2342

for Austyn seith in the ij. book of Cristene Teching, that if
equiuok wordis be not translatid into the sense, either vndurstonding ,
of the autour, it is errour; as in that place of the Salme, the feet of
hem ben swifte to shede out blood, the Greek word is equiuoik to sharp and
swift, and he that translatide sharpe feet, erride, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2343

and a book that hath sharpe feet, is fals, CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2344

and mut be amendid; as that sentence vnkynde +gonge trees shulen not
+geue depe rootis, owith to be thus, plauntingis of auoutrie shulen not
+geue depe rootis.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2345

Austyn seith this there.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,59.2346

Therfore <P_I,60> a translatour hath greet nede to studie wel the sentence
, both bifore and aftir, and loke that suche equiuok wordis acorde with
the sentence, CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2347

and he hath nede to lyue a clene lif, and be ful deuout in preiers, and
haue not his wit ocupied about worldli thingis, that the Holi Spiryt,
autour of wisdom, and kunnyng, and truthe, dresse him in his werk,
and suffre him not for to erre.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2348

Also this word ex signifieth sumtyme of, CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2349

and sumtyme it signifieth bi, as Jerom seith; CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2350

and this word enim signifieth comynli forsothe, CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2351

and, as Jerom seith, it signifieth cause thus, forwhi;
CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2352

and this word secundum is taken for aftir, as manie men seyn, and comynli,
CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2353

but it signifieth wel bi, eithir vp, thus bi +goure word, either vp
+goure word.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2354

Manie such aduerbis, coniuncciouns, and preposiciouns ben set ofte oon
for another, and at fre chois of autouris sumtyme; CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2355

and now tho shulen be taken as it acordith best to the sentence.
CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2356

Bi this maner, with good lyuyng and greet trauel, men moun come to
trewe and cleer translating, and trewe vndurstonding of holi writ,
seme it neuere so hard at the bigynnyng.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2357

God graunte to us alle grace to kunne wel, and kepe wel holi writ,
and suffre ioiefulli sum peyne for it at the laste!  CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2358

Amen.  CMPURVEY-M3,I,60.2359
