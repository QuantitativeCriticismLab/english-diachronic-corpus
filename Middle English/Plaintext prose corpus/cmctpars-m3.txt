Jer. 6=o=.  State super vias, et videte, et interrogate de viis
antiquis que sit via bona, et ambulate in ea; et invenietis refrigerium
animabus vestris, etc. CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.5

Oure sweete lord God of hevene, that no man wole perisse, but wole that
we comen alle to the knoweleche of hym, and to the blisful lif that is
perdurable, amonesteth us By the prophete Jeremie, that seith in thys
wyse:"Stondeth upon the weyes, and seeth And axeth of olde pathes <paren>
that is to seyn, of olde Sentences <$$paren> which is the goode wey,
and walketh in that wey, and ye shal fynde refresshynge for youre soules,
etc."CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.6

Manye been the weyes espirituels that leden folk to oure Lord Jhesu
Crist , and to the regne of glorie.  Of whiche weyes, ther is a ful
noble wey and ful covenable, which may nat fayle to man ne to womman
that thurgh synne hath mysgoon fro The righte wey of Jerusalem celestial;
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.7

and This wey is cleped Penitence, of which man Sholde gladly herknen
and enquere with His herte, to wyten what is Penitence, and wheenes
it is cleped Penitence, and in how manye maners been the acciouns or
werkynges of Penitence, and how manye speces Ther been of Penitence ,
and whiche thynges Apertenen and bihoven to Penitence, and Whiche thynges
destourben Penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,288.C1b.8

Seint Ambrose seith that Penitence is the pleynynge of man for the gilt
that he hath doon, and namoore to do any thyng for which <P_288.C2b>
hym oghte to pleyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.9

And som doctour seith,"Penitence is the waymentynge of man that sorweth
for his synne, CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.10

and pyneth hymself for he hath mysdoon. "CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.11

Penitence, With certeyne circumstances, is varray repentance of
a man that halt hymself in sorwe And oother peyne for his giltes.
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.12

And for he shal be verray penitent, he shal first biwaylen The synnes
that he hath doon, and stidefastly purposen in his herte to have shrift
of mouthe, and to doon satisfaccioun, and nevere to doon thyng for which
hym oghte moore to biwayle Or to compleyne, and to continue in goode
werkes, CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.13

or elles his repentance may nat availle.  CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.14

For, as seith Seint Ysidre,"He is a japere and A gabbere, and no verray
repentant, that eftsoone dooth thyng for which hym oghte repente.
"CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.15

Wepynge, and nat for to stynte to do synne, may nat avayle.
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.16

But nathelees, men shal hope that every tyme that man falleth, be it
never so ofte, that he may arise thurgh Penitence, if he have grace;
CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.17

but certeinly it is greet doute.  CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.18

For, as seith Seint Gregorie,"unnethe ariseth he out of his synne,
that is charged with the charge of yvel usage. "CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.19

And therfore repentant folk, that stynte for to Synne, and forlete
synne er that synne forlete hem, hooly chirche holdeth hem siker of
hire savacioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.20

And he that synneth and verraily repenteth hym in his laste, hooly chirche
yet hopeth his savacioun, by the grete mercy of Oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
for his repentaunce; CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.21

but taak the siker wey.  CMCTPARS-M3,288.C2b.22

And, now, sith I have declared yow what thyng is Penitence, now shul
ye understonde <P_289.C1> that ther been three acciouns of Penitence.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.23

The firste is that if a man be baptized after that he hath synned.
Seint Augustyn seith,"But he be penytent for his olde synful lyf, he
may nat bigynne the newe clene lif. "CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.24

For, certes, if he be baptized withouten penitence of his olde gilt,
he receyveth the mark of baptesme, but nat the grace ne the remission
of his synnes, til he have repentance verray.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.25

Another defaute is this: that men doon deedly synne after that they han
receyved baptesme.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.26

The thridde defaute is that men fallen in venial synnes after hir baptesme
, fro day to day.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.27

Therof seith Seint Augustyn that penitence of goode and humble folk is
the penitence of every day.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.28

The speces of Penitence been three.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.29

That oon of hem is solempne, CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.30

another is commune, CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.31

and the thridde is privee.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.32

Thilke penance that is solempne is in two maneres; as to be put out of
hooly chirche in Lente, for slaughtre of children and swich maner thyng.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.33

Another is, whan a man hath synned openly, of which synne the fame is
openly spoken in the contree, CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.34

and thanne hooly chirche by juggement destreyneth hym for to do open
penaunce.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.35

Commune penaunce is that preestes enjoynen men communly in certeyn
caas, as for to goon Peraventure naked in pilgrimages, or barefoot.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.36

Pryvee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee synnes
, of whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.37

Now $shal $tow {TEXT:shaltow} understande what is bihovely and necessarie
to verray perfit Penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.38

And This stant on three thynges: Contricioun of Herte, Confessioun of
Mouth, and Satisfaction.  for which seith Seint John Crisostom, "Penitence
destreyneth a man to accepte benygnely every peyne that hym is enjoyned,
with contricioun of herte, and shrift of mouth , with satisfaccioun,
and in werkynge of alle manere humylitee.  "CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.39

And this is fruytful penitence agayn three thinges in which we wratthe
oure Lord Jhesu Crist; this is to seyn, by delit in thynkynge,
by reccheleesnesse in spekynge, and by wikked synful werknyge.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.40

And agayns thise wikkede giltes is Penitence, that may be likned unto
a tree.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C1.41

<P_289.C2>

The roote of this tree is Contricioun, that hideth hym in the herte of
hym that is verray repentaunt, right as the roote of a tree gydeth hym
in the erthe.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.43

Of the roote of Contricioun spryngeth a stalke that bereth braunches and
leves of Confessioun, and fruyt of Satisfaccioun.  for which Crist seith
in his gospel,"Dooth digne fruyt of Penitence"; CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.44

for by this fruyt may men knowe this tree, and nat by the roote that
is hyd in the herte of man, ne by the braunches, ne by the leves of
Confessioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.45

And therfore oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith thus:"By the fruyt of hem shul
ye knowen hem. "CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.46

Of this roote eek spryngeth a seed of grace, the which seed is mooder
of sikernesse, CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.47

and this seed is egre and hoot.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.48

The grace of this seed spryngeth of God thurgh remembrance of the day
of doom and on the peynes of helle.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.49

Of this matere seith Salomon that in the drede of God man forleteth
his synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.50

The heete of this seed is the love of God, and the desiryng of the
joye perdurable.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.51

This heete draweth the herte of a man to God CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.52

and dooth hym haten his synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.53

For soothly ther is nothyng that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk
of his norice, CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.54

ne nothyng is to hym moore abhomnyable than thilke milk whan it is medled
with oother mete.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.55

Right so the synful man that loveth his synne, hym semeth that it is to
him moost sweete of any thyng; CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.56

but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and
desireth the lif perdurable, ther nys to him no thyng moore abhomynable.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.57

For soothly the lawe of God is the love of God; for which David the
prophete seith:"I have loved thy lawe, and hated wikkednesse and hate
"; CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.58

he that loveth God kepeth his lawe and his word.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.59

This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit, upon the avysioun
of the kyng Nabugodonosor, whan he conseiled hym to do penitence.
CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.60

Penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receyven, CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.61

and he that holdeth hym in verray penitence is blessed, after the sentence
of Solomon.  CMCTPARS-M3,289.C2.62

In this Penitence or Contricioun man shal Understonde foure thynges;
that is to seyn, what is Contricioun, and whiche been the causes that
moeven a man to Contricioun, and how he <P_290.C1> sholde be contrit,
and what Contricioun availleth to the soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.63

Thanne is it thus: that contricioun is the verray sorwe that a man
receyveth in his herte for his synnes, with sad purpos to shryve hum,
and to do penaunce, and neveremoore to do synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.64

And this sorwe shal been in this manere, as seith Seint Bernard:
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.65

"it shal been hevy and grevous, and ful sharp and poynaunt in herte.
"CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.66

First, for man hath agilt his Lord and his Creatour; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.67

and moore sharp and poynaunt, for he hath agilt hys Fader celestial;
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.68

and yet moore sharp and Poynaunt, for he hath wrathed and agilt hym that
boghte hym, that with his precious blood hath delivered us fro the bondes
of synne, and fro the crueltee of the devel, and fro the peynes of helle.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.69

The causes that oghte moeve a man to Contricioun been sixe.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.70

First a man shal remembre hym of his synnes; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.71

but looke he that thilke remembraunce ne be to hym no delit by no wey,
but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.72

For Job seith,"Synful men doon werkes worthy of confusioun.
"CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.73

And therfore seith Ezechie,"I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf
in bitternesse of myn herte. "CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.74

And God seith in the Apocalipse,"Remembreth yow fro whennes that ye been
falle"; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.75

for biforn that tyme that ye synned, ye were the children of God and
lymes of the regne of God; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.76

but for youre synne ye been woxen thral, and foul, and membres of the
feend, hate of aungels, sclaundre of hooly chirche, and foode of the
false serpent, perpetueel matere of the fir of helle; and yet moore foul
and abhomynable, CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.77

for ye trespassen so ofte tyme as dooth the hound that retourneth to
eten his spewyng.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.78

And yet be ye fouler for youre longe continuyng in synne and youre synful
usage, for which ye be roten in youre synne, as a beest in his dong.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.79

Swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his synne, and
no delit, as God seith by the prophete Ezechiel, CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.80

"Ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes, CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.81

and they shuln displese yow. "CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.82

Soothly synnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C1.83

The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of synne is this:
that, as seith Seint Peter,"whoso that dooth synne is thral <P_290.C2>
of synne"; CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.84

and synne put a man in greet thraldom.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.85

And therfore seith the prophete Ezechiel:"I wente sorweful in desdayn
of myself. "CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.86

Certes, wel oghte a man have desdayn of synne and withdrawe hym from
that thraldom and vileynye.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.87

And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere?  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.88

He seith thus: CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.89

"Though I wiste that neither God ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it,
yet wolde I have desdayn for to do synne. "CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.90

And the same Seneca also seith:"I am born to gretter thynges than
to be thral to my body, or than for to maken of my body a thral.
"CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.91

Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body than for to
yeven his body to synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.92

Al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste womman that lyveth, and
leest of value, yet is he thanne moore foul and moore in servitute.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.93

Evere fro the hyer degree that {fro} man falleth, the moore is
he thral, and moore to God and to the world vile and abhomynable.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.94

O goode God, wel oghte man have desdayn of synne, sith that thurgh synne
ther he was free now is he maked bonde.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.95

And therfore seyth Seint Augustyn:"If thou hast desdayn of thy servant ,
if he agilte or synne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest
do synne. "CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.96

Tak reward of thy value, that thou ne be foul to thyself.
CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.97

Allas, wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles
to synne, and soore been ashamed of hemself that God of his endelees
goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of
body, heele, beautee, prosperitee, and boghte hem fro the deeth with
his herte-blood, that they so unkyndely, agayns his gentilesse, quiten
hym so vileynsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.98

O goode God, ye wommen that been of so greet beautee, remembreth yow of
the proverbe of Salomon.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.99

He seith,"Likneth a fair womman that is a fool of hire body lyk to a
ryng of gold that were in the groyn of a soughe. " CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.100

For right as a soughe wroteth in everich ordure, so wroteth she hire
beautee in the stynkynge ordure of synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.101

The thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to Contricioun is drede of the
day of doom and of the horrible peynes of helle.  CMCTPARS-M3,290.C2.102

For as Seint <P_291.C1> Jerome seith,"At every tyme that me remembreth
of the day of doom I quake; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.103

for whan I ete or drynke, or what so that I do, evere semeth me that
the trompe sowneth in myn ere: CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.104

'Riseth up, ye that been dede, CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.105

and cometh to the juggement. '"CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.106

O goode God, muchel oghte a man to drede swich a juggement,"ther as
we shullen been alle,"as Seint Poul seith,"biforn the seete of oure
Lord Jhesu Crist"; $where $as {TEXT:whereas} he shal make a general
congregacioun, $where $as {TEXT:whereas} no man may been absent.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.107

For certes there availleth noon essoyne ne excusacioun.  And nat oonly
that oure defautes shullen be jugged, but eek that alle oure werkes
shullen openly be knowe.  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.108

And, as seith Seint Bernard,"Ther ne shal no pledynge availle, ne no
sleighte; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.109

we shullen yeven rekenynge of everich ydel word. " CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.110

Ther shul we han a juge that may nat been deceyved ne corrupt.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.111

And why?  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.112

For, certes, alle oure thoghtes been discovered as to hym,
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.113

ne for preyere ne for meede he shal nat been corrupt.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.114

And therfore seith Salomon,"The wratthe of God ne wol nat spare no wight,
for preyere ne for yifte"; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.115

and therfore, at the day of doom ther nys noon hope to escape.  Wherfore,
as seith Seint Anselm,"Ful greet angwyssh shul the synful folk have at
that tyme; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.116

ther shal the stierne and wrothe juge sitte above, and under hym the
horrible pit of helle open to destroyen hym that moot biknowen his synnes
, whiche synnes openly been shewed biforn God and biforn every creature;
and in the left syde mo develes than herte may bithynke, for to harye
and drawe the synful soules to the peyne of helle; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.117

and withinne the hertes of folk shal be bitynge conscience,
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.118

and withouteforth shal be the world al brennynge.  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.119

Whider shall thanne the wrecched synful man flee to hiden hym?
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.120

Certes, he may nat hyden hym; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.121

he moste come forth and shewen hym. "CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.122

For certes, as seith seint Jerome,"the erthe shal casten hym out of hym,
and the see also, and the eyr also, that shal be ful of thonder-clappes
and lightnynges. "CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.123

Now soothly, whoso wel remembreth hym of thise thynges, I gesse that
his synne shal nat turne hym into delit, but to greet sorwe for drede
of the peyne of helle.  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C1.124

And therfore seith Job to God,"Suffre, <P_291.C2> Lord, that I may a
while biwaille and wepe, er I go withoute returnyng to the derke lond
, covered with the derknesse of deeth, to the lond of mysese and of
derknesse, $where $as {TEXT:whereas} is the shadwe of deeth, whereas
ther is noon ordre or ordinaunce but grisly drede that evere shal laste.
"CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.125

Loo, heere may ye seen that Job preyde respit a while to biwepe and
waille his trespas, CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.126

for soothly oo day of respit is bettre than al the tresor of this world.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.127

And forasmuche as a man may acquiten hymself biforn God by penitence
in this world, and nat by tresor, therfore sholde he preye to God
to yeve hym respit a while to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.128

For certes, al the sorwe that a man myghte make fro the bigynnyng
of the world nys but a litel thyng at regard of the sorwe of helle.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.129

The cause why that Job clepeth helle the"lond of derknesse":
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.130

understondeth that he clepeth it"lond"or erthe, for it is stable and
nevere shal faille; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.131

"derk,"for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.132

For certes, the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal
brenne shal turne hym al to peyne that is in helle CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.133

for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that hym tormenten.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.134

"Covered with the derknesse of deeth"- that is to seyn, that he that is
in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of God, CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.135

for certes the sighte of God is the lyf perdurable.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.136

"The derknesse of deeth"been the synnes that the wrecched man hath doon,
whiche that destourben hym to see the face of God, right as dooth a derk
clowde bitwixe us and the sonne.  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.137

"Lond of misese,"by cause that ther been three maneres of defautes,
agayn three thynges that folk of this world han in this present lyf;
that is to seyn, honours, delices, and richesses.  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.138

Agayns honour, have they in helle shame and confusioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.139

For wel ye woot that men clepen honour the reverence that man doth to
man, CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.140

but in helle is noon honour ne reverence.  CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.141

For certes, namoore reverence shal be doon there to a kyng than to
a knave.  For which God seith by the prophete Jeremye,"Thilke folk that
me despisen shul been in despit. "CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.142

Honour is eek cleped greet lordshipe; CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.143

ther shal no wight serven other, but of harm and torment.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.144

Honour is eek cleped greet dignytee and heighnesse, CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.145

but in helle shul they been al fortroden of develes.
CMCTPARS-M3,291.C2.146

And <P_292.C1> God seith,"The horrible develes shulle goon and comen
upon the hevedes of the dampned folk. "CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.147

And this is for as muche as the hyer that they were in this present
lyf, the moore shulle they been abated and defouled in helle.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.148

Agayns the richesse of this world shul they han mysese of poverte,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.149

and this poverte shal been in foure thynges: CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.150

In defaute of tresor, of which that David seith,"The riche folk, that
embraceden and oneden al hire herte to tresor of this world, shul slepe
in the slepynge of deeth; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.151

and nothyng ne shal they fynden in hir handes of al hir tresor.
"CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.152

And mooreover the myseyse of helle shal been in defaute of mete and
drinke.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.153

For God seith thus by Moyses:"They shul been wasted with hunger,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.154

and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with bitter deeth,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.155

and the galle of the dragon shal been hire drynke, and the venym of the
dragon hire morsels. "CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.156

And forther over, hire myseyse shal been in defaute of clothyng,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.157

for they shulle be naked in body as of clothyng, save the fyr in which
they bree and othere filthes; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.158

and naked shul they been of soule, as of alle manere vertues, which that
is the clothyng of the soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.159

Where been thanne the gaye robes, and the softe shetes, and the smale
shertes?  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.160

loo, what seith God of hem by the prophete Ysaye: CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.161

that"under hem shul been strawed motthes, and hire covertures shulle
been of womres of helle. "CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.162

And forther over, hir myseyse shal been in defaute of freendes.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.163

For he nys nat povre that hath goode freendes; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.164

but there is no frend, CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.165

for neither God ne no creature shal been freend to hem,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.166

and everich of hem shal haten oother with deedly hate.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.167

"The sones and the doghtren shullen rebellen agayns fader and mooder ,
and kynrede agauns kynrede, and chiden and despisen everich of hem
oother bothe day and nyght,"as God seith by the prophete Michias.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.168

And the lovynge children, that whilom loveden so flesshly everich oother,
Wolden everich of hem eten oother if they Myghte.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.169

For how sholden they love hem togidre in the peyne of helle, whan
they hated everich of hem oother in the prosperitee of this lyf?
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.170

For truste wel, hir flesshly love was deedly hate, as seith the prophete
David: CMCTPARS-M3,292.C1.171

<P_292.C2>

"whoso that loveth wikkednesse, he hateth his soule. "
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.173

And whoso hateth his owene soule, certes, he may love noon oother wight
in no manere.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.174

And therfore, in helle is no solas ne no freendshipe,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.175

but evere the moore flesshly kynredes that been in helle, the Moore
cursynges, the more chidynges, and the moore deedly hate ther is
among hem.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.176

And forther over, they shul have defaute of alle manere delices.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.177

For certes, delices been after the appetites of the fyve wittes
, as sighte, herynge, smellynge, savorynge, and touchynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.178

But in helle hir sighte shal be ful of derknesse And of smoke, and
therfore ful of teeres; and hir herynge ful of waymentynge and of
gryntynge of teeth, as seith Jhesu Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.179

Hir nose-thirles shullen be ful of stynkynge stynk; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.180

and as seith Ysaye the prophete,"hir savoryng shal be ful of bitter
galle"; and touchynge of al hir body ycovered with"fir that nevere shal
quenche, and with wormes that nevere shul dyen,"as God seith by the
mouth of Ysaye.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.181

And for as muche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne ,
and by hir deeth flee fro peyne, that may they understonden by the word of
Job, that seith,"ther as is the shadwe of deeth.  "CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.182

Certes, a shadwe hath the liknesse of the thyng of which it is shadwe,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.183

but shadwe is nat the same thyng of which it is shadwe.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.184

Right so fareth the peyne of helle; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.185

it is lyk deeth for the horrible angwissh, CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.186

and why?  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.187

For it peyneth hem evere, as though they sholde dye anon;
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.188

but certes, they shal nat dye.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.189

For, as seith Seint Gregorie,"To wrecche caytyves shal be deeth
withoute deeth, and ende withouten ende, and defaute withoute failynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.190

For hir deeth shal alwey lyven, CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.191

and hir ende shal everemo bigynne, CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.192

and hir defaute shal nat faille. "CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.193

And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist,"they shullen folwe deeth,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.194

and they shul nat fynde hym; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.195

and they shul desiren to dye, CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.196

and deeth shal flee fro hem. "CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.197

And eek Job seith that in helle is noon ordre of rule.
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.198

And al be it so that God hath creat alle thynges in right ordre, and
no thyng withouten ordre, but alle thynges been ordeyned and nombred
; yet, nathelees, they that been dampned been nothyng in ordre,
CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.199

ne holden noon ordre, CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.200

for the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruyt.  CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.201

For, as the prophete David seith,"God shal destroie the fruyt of the
erthe as fro hem; CMCTPARS-M3,292.C2.202

ne water ne <P_293.C1> shal yeve hem no moisture, ne the eyr no
refresshyng, ne fyr no light. "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.203

For, as seith Seint Basilie,"the brennynge of the fyr of this world shal
God yeven in helle to hem that been dampned, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.204

but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to this children
,"right as the goode man yeveth flessh to his children and bones to
his houndes.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.205

And for they shullen have noon hope to escape, seith Seint Job $at
$te {TEXT:atte} laste that"ther shal horrour and grisly drede dwellen
withouten ende. "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.206

Horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.207

and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned.
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.208

And therfore han they lorn al hire hope, for sevene causes.
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.209

First, for God, that is hir juge, shal be withouten mercy to hem; and
they may nat plese hym ne noon of his halwes; ne they ne may yeve no
thyng for hir raunsoun; ne they have no voys to speke to hym; ne they
may nat fle fro peyne; ne they have no goodnesse in hem, that they mowe
shewe to delivere hem fro peyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.210

And therfore seith Salomon:"the wikked man dyeth, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.211

and whan he is deed, he shal have noon hope to escape fro peyne.
"CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.212

Whoso thanne wolde wel understande thise peynes, and bithynke hym weel
that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his synnes, certes, he sholde
have moore talent to Siken and to wepe, than for to syngen and to pleye.
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.213

For, as that seith Salomon,"Whoso that hadde the science to knowe the
peynes that been establissed and ordeyned for synne, he wolde make
sorwe. "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.214

"Thilke science,"as seith Seint Augustyn,"maketh a man to waymenten in
his herte. "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.215

The fourthe point that oghte maken a man to have contricion is the
sorweful remembraunce of the good that he hath left to doon heere in
erthe, and eek the good that he hath lorn.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.216

Soothly, the goode werkes that he hath lost, outher they been the goode
werkes that he wroghte er he fel into deedly synne, or elles the goode
werkes that he wroghte while he lay in synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.217

Soothly, the goode werkes that he dide biforn that he fil in synne
been al mortefied and astoned and dulled by the ofte synnyng.
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.218

The othere goode werkes, that he wroghte whil he lay in deedly
synne, thei been outrely dede, as to the lyf perdurable in hevene.
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C1.219

<P_293.C2>

Thanne thikle goode werkes that been mortefied by ofte synnyng, whiche
goode werkes he dide whil he was in charitee, ne mowe nevere quyken
agayn withouten verray penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.221

And therof seith God by the mouth of Ezechiel, that"if the rightful
man returne agayn from his rightwisnesse and werke wikkednesse, shal he
lyve? "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.222

Nay, for alle the goode werkes that he hath wroght ne shul nevere been
in remembraunce, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.223

for he shal dyen in this synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.224

And upon thilke chapitre seith Seint Gregorie thus: CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.225

that"we shulle understonde this principally; that whan we doon Deedly
synne, it is for noght thanne to rehercen or drawen into memorie the
goode werkes that we han wroght biforn. "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.226

For certes, in the werkynge of the deedly synne, ther is no trust to
no good werk that we han doon biforn; that is to seyn, as for to have
therby the lyf perdurable in hevene.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.227

But nathelees, the goode werkes quyken agayn, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.228

and comen agayn, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.229

and helpen, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.230

and availlen to have the lyf perdurable in hevene, whan we han
contricioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.231

but soothly, the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in deedly
synne, for as muche as they were doon in deedly synne, they may nevere
quyke agayn.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.232

For certes, thyng that nevere hadde lyf may nevere quykene;
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.233

and nathelees, al be it that they ne availle noght to han the lyf
perdurable, yet availlen they to abregge of the peyne of helle, or
elles to geten temporal richesse, or elles that God wole the rather
enlumyne and lightne the herte of the synful man to have repentaunce;
CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.234

and eek they availlen for to usen a man to doon goode werkes, that the
feend have the lasse power of his soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.235

And thus the curteis Lord Jhesu Crist ne wole that no good werk be lost
, CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.236

for in somwhat it shal availle.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.237

But, for as muche as the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in
good lyf been al mortefied by synne folwynge, and eek sith that alle the
goode werkes that men doon whil They been in deedly synne been outrely
dede as for to have the lyf perdurable, wel may that man that no good
werk ne dooth synge thilke newe frenshe song,"jay tout perdu mon temps
et mon labour. "CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.238

For certes, synne bireveth a man bothe goodnesse of nature and eek the
goodnesse of grace.  CMCTPARS-M3,293.C2.239

For soothly, the grace of <P_294.C1> the Hooly Goost fareth lyk fyr,
that may nat been ydel; CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.240

for fyr fayleth anoon as it forleteth his wirkynge, CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.241

and right so grace fayleth anoon as it forleteth his werkynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.242

Then leseth the synful man the goodnesse of glorie, that oonly is bihight
to goode men that labouren and werken.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.243

Wel may he be sory thanne, that oweth al his lif to God as longe as
he hath lyved, and eek as longe as he shal lyve, that no goodnesse
ne hath to paye with his dette to God to whom he oweth al his lyf.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.244

For trust wel,"He shal yeven acountes,"as seith Seint Bernard, "of alle
the goodes that han be yeven hym in this present lyf, and how he hath hem
despended, $in so muche that ther shal nat perisse an heer of his heed,
ne a moment of an houre ne shal nat perisse of his tyme, that he ne shal
yeve of it a rekenyng. "CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.245

The fifthe thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is remembrance
of the passioun that oure Lord Jhesu Crist suffred for oure synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.246

For, as seith Seint Bernard,"Whil that I lyve I shal have remembrance of
the travailles that oure Lord Crist suffred in prechyng: his werynesse
in travaillyng, his temptaciouns whan he fasted, his longe wakynges
whan he preyde, hise teeres whan that he weep for pitee of good peple,
the wo and the shame and the filthe that men seyden to hym, of the foule
spittyng that men spitte in his face, of the buffettes that men yaven hym,
of the foule mowes, and of the repreves that men to hym seyden, of the
nayles with whiche he was nayled to the croys, and of al the remenant
of his passioun that he suffred for my synnes, CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.247

and no thyng for his gilt. "CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.248

And ye shul understonde that in mannes synne is every manere of ordre
or ordinaunce turned up-so-doun.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.249

For it is sooth that God, and resoun, and sensualitee, and the body of
man been so ordeyned that everich of thise foure thynges sholde have
lordshipe over that oother, as thus: CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.250

God sholde have lordshipe over resoun, and resoun over sensualitee,
and sensualitee over the body of man.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.251

But Soothly, whan man synneth, al this ordre or ordinaunce is turned
up-so-doun.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C1.252

And therfore thanne, for as muche as the resoun of man ne wol nat be
subget ne obeisant to God, that is his lord by right, therfore leseth
it the lordshipe <P_294.C2> that it sholde have over sensualitee, and
eek over the body of man.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.253

And why?  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.254

For sensualitee rebelleth thanne agayns resoun, CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.255

and by that way leseth resoun the lordshipe over sensualitee and over
the body.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.256

For right as resoun is rebel to God, right so is bothe sensualitee rebel
to resoun and the body also.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.257

And certes this disordinaunce and this rebellioun oure Lord Jhesu Crist
aboghte Upon his precious body ful deere, CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.258

and herkneth in which wise.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.259

For as muche thanne as resoun is rebel to God, therfore is man worthy
to have sorwe and to be deed.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.260

This suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man, after that he hadde be
bitraysed of his disciple, and distreyned and bounde, so that his
blood brast out at every nayl of his handes, as seith Seint Augustyn.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.261

And forther over, for as muchel As resoun of man ne wol nat daunte
sensualitee whan it may, therfore is man worthy to have shame;
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.262

and this suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man, whan they spetten in
his visage.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.263

And forther over, for as muchel thanne as the caytyf body of man is rebel
bothe to resoun and to sensualitee, therfore is it worthy the deeth.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.264

And this suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man upon the croys where
as ther was no part of his body free withouten greet peyne and bitter
passioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.265

And al this suffred Jhesu Crist, that nevere forfeted.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.266

And therfore resonably may be seyd of Jhesu in this manere:
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.267

"To muchel am I peyned for the thynges that I nevere deserved,
and to muche defouled for shendshipe that man is worthy to have.
"CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.268

And therfore may the synful man wel seye, as seith Seint Bernard,
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.269

"Acursed be the bitternesse of my synne, for which ther moste be suffred
so muchel bitternesse. "CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.270

For certes, after the diverse $disordinaunces of oure wikkednesses
was the passioun of Jhesu Crist ordeyned in diverse thynges.
CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.271

As thus: Certes, synful mannes soule is bitraysed of the devel by
coveitise of temporeel prosperitee, and scorned by deceite whan he
cheseth flesshly delices; CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.272

and yet is it tormented by inpacience of adversitee, And bispet by
servage and subjeccioun of synne; CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.273

and $at $te {TEXT:atte} laste it is slayn fynally.  CMCTPARS-M3,294.C2.274

For <P_295.C1> this disordinaunce of synful man was Jhesu Crist first
bitraysed, CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.275

and after that was he bounde, that cam for to unbynden us of synne
and peyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.276

Thanne was he byscorned, that oonly sholde han been honoured in alle
thynges and of alle thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.277

Thanne was his visage, that oghte be desired to be seyn of al
mankynde , in which visage aungels desiren to looke, Vileynsly bispet.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.278

Thanne was he scourged, that no thyng hadde agilt; CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.279

and finally, thanne was he crucified and slayn.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.280

Thanne was acompliced the word of Ysaye,"He was wounded for oure mysdedes
and defouled for oure felonies. "CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.281

Now sith that Jhesu Crist took upon hymself the peyne of alle
oure wikkednesses, muchel oghte synful man wepen and biwayle, that
for his synnes Goddes sone of hevene sholde al this peyne endure.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.282

The sixte thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is the hope of
three thynges; that is to seyn, foryifnesse of synne, and the yifte
to grace wel for to do, and the glorie of hevene, with which God shal
gerdone man for his goode dedes.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.283

And for as muche as Jhesu Crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse
and of his sovereyn bountee, therfore is he cleped Jhesus Nazarenus
rex Judeorum.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.284

Jhesus is to seyn"saveour"or"salvacioun,"on whom men shul hope to have
foryifnesse of synnes, which that is proprely salvacioun of synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.285

And therfore seyde the aungel to Joseph,"Thou shalt clepen his name
Jhesus, that shal saven his peple of hir synnes. " CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.286

And heerof seith Seint Peter:"Ther is noon oother name under hevene
that is yeve to any man, by which a man may be saved, but oonly Jhesus.
"CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.287

Nazarenus is as muche for to seye as"florisshynge,"in which a man shal
hope that he that yeveth hym remissioun of synnes shal geve hym eek
grace wel for to do.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.288

For in the flour is hope of fruyt in tyme comynge, and in foryifnesse
of synnes hope of grace wel for to do.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.289

"I was $at $te {TEXT:atte} dore of thyn herte, seith Jhesus,
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.290

"and cleped for to entre.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.291

He that openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.292

I wol entre into hym by my grace, and soupe with hym,"by the goode
werkes that he shal doon, whiche werkes been the foode of God;
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C1.293

<P_295.C2>

"and he shal soupe with me"by the grete joye that I shal yeven hym.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.295

Thus shal man hope, for his werkes of penaunce that God shal yeven hym
his regne, as he bihooteth hym in the gospel.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.296

Now shal a man understonde in which manere shal been his contricioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.297

I seye that it shal been universal and total.  This is to seyn, a man
shal be verray repentaunt for alle his synnes that he hath doon in delit
of his thoght, CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.298

for delit is ful perilous.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.299

For ther been two manere of consentynges: CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.300

that oon of hem is cleped consentynge of affeccioun, whan a man is
moeved to do synne, and deliteth hym longe for to thynke on that synne ;
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.301

and his reson aperceyveth it wel that it is synne agayns the lawe of God,
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.302

and yet his resoun refreyneth nat his foul delit or talent,
though he se wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of God.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.303

Although his resoun ne consente noght to doon that synne in dede, yet seyn
somme doctours that swich delit that dwelleth longe, it is ful perilous,
al be it nevere so lite.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.304

And also a man sholde sorwe namely for al that evere he hath
desired agayn the lawe of God with perfit consentynge of his resoun,
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.305

for therof is no doute, that it is deedly synne in consentynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.306

For certes, ther is no deedly synne, that it nas first in mannes thought,
and after that in his delit, and so forth into consentynge and into dede.
Wherfore I seye that many men ne repenten hem nevere of swiche thoghtes
and delites, ne nevere shryven hem of it, but oonly of the dede of
grete synnes outward.  Wherfore I seye that swiche wikked delites and
wikked thoghtes been subtile bigileres of hem that shullen be dampned.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.307

Mooreover, man oghte to sorwe for his wikkede wordes as wel as for his
wikkede dedes.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.308

For certes, the repentaunce of a synguler synne, and nat repente of
alle his othere synnes, or elles repenten hym of alle his othere synnes,
and nat of a synguler synne, may nat availle.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.309

For certes, God almyghty is al good, CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.310

and therfore he foryeveth al, or elles right noght.
CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.311

And heerof seith Seint Augustyn,"I wot certeynly that God is enemy to
everich synnere. "CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.312

and how Thanne?  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.313

He that observeth o synne, shal he have foryifnesse of the remenaunt of
his othere synnes?  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.314

Nay.  CMCTPARS-M3,295.C2.315

And forther over, contrcioun <P_296.C1a> sholde be wonder sorweful and
angwissous; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.316

and therfore yeveth hym God pleynly his mercy; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.317

and therfore, whan my soule was angwissous withinne me, I
hadde remembrance of God that my preyere myghte come to hym.
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.318

Forther over, contricioun moste be continueel, and that man have
stedefast purpos to shriven hym, and for to amenden hym of his lyf.
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.319

For soothly, whil contricioun lasteth, man may evere have hope of
foryifnesse; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.320

and of this comth hate of synne, that destroyeth synne, bothe in himself,
and eek in oother folk, at his power.  For which seith David: "ye that
loven God, hateth wikkednesse. "CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.321

For trusteth wel, to love God is for to love that he loveth, and hate
that he hateth.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.322

The laste thyng that men shal understonde in contricioun is this: wherof
avayleth contricioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.323

I seye that somtyme contricioun delivereth a man fro synne; of which
that David seith,"I seye,"quod David <paren> that is to seyn, I purposed
fermely <$$paren>"to shryve me, CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.324

and thow, Lord, relessedest my synne. "CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1a.325

And right so as Contricion availleth noght withouten sad purpos of
shrifte , if man have oportunitee, right <P_296.C2a> so litel worth is
shrifte or satisfaccioun withouten contricioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.326

And mooreover contricion destroyeth the prisoun of helle,
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.327

and maketh wayk and fieble alle the strengthes of the develes,
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.328

and restoreth the yiftes of the Hooly Goost and of alle goode vertues;
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.329

and it clenseth the soule of synne, CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.330

and delivereth the soule fro the peyne of helle, and fro the compaignye
of the devel, and fro the servage of synne, CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.331

and restoreth it to alle goodes espirituels, and to the compaignye and
communyoun of hooly chirche.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.332

And forther over, it maketh hym that whilom was sone of ire to be sone
of grace; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.333

and alle thise thynges been preved by hooly writ.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.334

And therfore, he that wolde sette his entente to thise thynges, he were
ful wys; CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.335

for soothly he ne sholde nat thanne in al his lyf have corage to synne
, but yeven his body and al his herte to the service of Jhesu Crist,
and therof doon hym hommage.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.336

For soothly oure sweete Lord Jhesu Crist hath spared us so debonairly
in oure folies, that if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule, a sory song
we Myghten alle synge.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2a.337

<$$heading>

<P_296.C1b>

The seconde partie of Penitence is Confessioun, that is signe of
contricioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.342

Now shul ye understonde what is Confessioun, and wheither it oghte nedes
be doon or noon, and whiche thynges been covenable to verray Confessioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.343

First $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} understonde that Confessioun is verray
shewynge of synnes to the preest.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.344

This is to seyn"verray,"for he moste confessen hym of alle the
condiciouns that bilongen to his synne, as ferforth as he kan.
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.345

Al moot be seyd, and no thyng excused ne hyd ne forwrapped,
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.346

and noght avaunte thee of thy goode werkes.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.347

And forther over, it is necessarie to understonde whennes that
synnes spryngen, and how they encreessen and whiche they been.
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C1b.348

Of the spryngynge of synnes seith Seint Paul in this wise: that" Right
as by a man synne entred first into this world, and thurgh that synne
deeth, right so thilke deeth entred into alle <P_296.C2b> men that
synneden. "CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.349

And this man was Adam, by whom synne entred into this world, whan he
brak the comaundementz of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.350

And therfore, he that first was so myghty that he sholde nat have
dyed , bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye, wheither he wolde or
noon , and al his progenye in this world, that in thilke man synneden.
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.351

Looke that in th'estaat of innocence, whan Adam and Eve naked weren
in Paradys, and nothyng ne hadden shame of hir nakednesse, how that
the serpent, that was moost wily of alle othere beestes that God hadde
maked, seyde to the womman,"Why comaunded God to yow ye sholde nat eten
of every tree in Paradys? "CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.352

The womman answerde:"Of the fruyt,"quod she,"of the trees in Paradys we
feden us, CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.353

but soothly, of the fruyt of the tree that is in the myddel of Paradys ,
God forbad us for to ete, ne nat touchen it, lest per aventure we sholde
dyen. "CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.354

The serpent seyde to the womman,"Nay, nay, ye shul nat dyen of deeth;
CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.355

for sothe, God woot that what day that ye eten therof, youre eyen
shul opene and ye shul been as goddes, knowynge good and harm.
"CMCTPARS-M3,296.C2b.356

The womman thanne <P_297.C1> saugh that the tree was good to feedyng,
and fair to the eyen, and delitable to the sighte.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.357

She took of the fruyt of the tree, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.358

and eet it, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.359

and yaf to hire housbonde, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.360

and he eet, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.361

and anoon the eyen of hem bothe openeden.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.362

And whan that they knewe that they were naked, they sowed of fige leves
a maner of breches to hiden hire membres.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.363

There may ye seen that deedly synne hath, first, suggestion of the feend,
as sheweth heere by the naddre; and afterward, the delit of the flessh,
as sheweth heere by Eve; and after that, the consentynge of resoun,
as sheweth heere by Adam.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.364

For trust wel, though so were that the feend tempted Eve - that is to
seyn, the flessh - and the flessh hadde delit in the beautee of the fruyt
defended, yet certes, til that resoun - that is to seyn, Adam - consented
to the etynge of the fruyt, yet stood he in th'estaat of innocence.
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.365

Of thilke Adam tooke we thilke synne original, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.366

for of hym flesshly descended be we alle, and engendred of vile and
corrupt mateere.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.367

And whan the soule is put in oure body, right anon is contract original
synne; CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.368

and that that was erst but oonly peyne of concupiscence is afterward
bothe peyne and synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.369

And therfore be we alle born sones of wratthe and of dampnacioun
perdurable, if it nere baptesme that we receyven, which bynymeth us
the culpe.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.370

But for sothe, the peyne dwelleth with us, as to temptacioun, which
peyne highte concupiscence.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.371

And this concupiscence, whan it is wrongfully disposed or ordeyned in
man, it maketh hym coveite, by coveitise of flessh, flesshly synne , by
sighte of his eyen as to erthely thynges, and eek coveitise of hynesse
by pride of herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.372

Now, as for to speken of the firste coveitise, that is concupiscence ,
after the lawe of oure membres that weren lawefulliche ymaked and by
rightful juggement of God, I seye, forasmuche as man is nat obeisaunt to
God, that is his lord, therfore is the flessh to hym disobeisaunt thurgh
concupiscence, which yet is cleped norrissynge of synne and occasioun
of synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.373

Therfore, al the while that a man hath in hym the peyne of concupiscence
, it is impossible but he be tempted somtime and moeved in his flessh
to synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C1.374

And this thyng may nat faille as longe <P_297.C2> as he lyveth;
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.375

it may wel wexe fieble and faille by vertu of baptesme and by the grace
of God thurgh penitence, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.376

but fully ne shal it nevere quenche, that he ne shal som tyme be moeved
in hymself, but if he were al refreyded by siknesse, or by malefice of
sorcerie, or colde drynkes.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.377

For lo, what seith Seint Paul:"The flessh coveiteth agayn the spirit,
and the spirit agayn the flessh; CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.378

they been so contrarie and so stryven that a man may nat alway doon as
he wolde. "CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.379

The same Seint Paul, after his grete penaunce in water and in lond -
in water by nyght and by day in greet peril and in greet peyne; in lond,
in famyne and thurst, in coold and cloothlees, and ones stoned almoost
to the deeth - yet seyde he,"Allas, I caytyf man!  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.380

Who shal delivere me fro the prisoun of my caytyf body? "
CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.381

And Seint Jerome, whan he longe tyme hadde woned in desert, where as he
hadde no compaignye but of wilde beestes, where as he ne hadde no mete
but herbes, and water to his drynke, ne no bed but the naked erthe, for
which his flessh was blak as an Ethiopeen for heete, and ny destroyed
for coold, yet seyde he that"the brennynge of lecherie boyled in al his
body. "Wherfore I woot wel sykerly that they been deceyved that seyn
that they ne be nat tempted in hir body.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.382

Witnesse on Seint Jame the Apostel, that seith that"every wight is
tempted in his owene concupiscence"; that is to seyn, that everich of
us hath matere and occasioun to be tempted of the norissynge of synne
that is in his body.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.383

And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist,"If that we seyn that we
be withoute synne, we deceyve us selve, CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.384

and trouthe is nat in us. "CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.385

Now shal ye understonde in what manere that synne wexeth or encreesseth
in man.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.386

The firste thyng is thilke norissynge of synne of which I spak biforn,
thilke flesshly concupiscence.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.387

And after that comth the subjeccioun of the devel - this is to seyn,
the develes bely, with which he bloweth in man the fir of flesshly
concupiscence.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.388

And after that, a man bithynketh hym wheither he wol doon or no thilke
thing to which he is tempted.  CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.389

And thanne, if that a man withstonde and weyve the firste entisynge of
his flessh and of the feend, thanne is it no synne; CMCTPARS-M3,297.C2.390

<P_298.C1>

and if it so be that he do nat so, thanne feeleth he anoon a flambe
of delit.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.392

And thanne is it good to be war and kepen hym wel, CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.393

or elles he wol falle anon into consentynge of synne;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.394

and thanne wol he do it, if he may have tyme and place.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.395

And of this matere seith Moyses by the devel in this manere:
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.396

"The feend seith,'I wole chace and pursue the man by wikked suggestioun,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.397

and I wole hente hym by moevynge or stirynge of synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.398

And I wol departe my prise or my praye by deliberacioun,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.399

and my lust shal been acompliced in delit.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.400

I wol drawe my swerd in consentynge'"- for certes, right as a swerd
departeth a thyng in two peces, right so consentynge departeth God fro
man - CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.401

"'and thanne wol I sleen hym with myn hand in dede of synne';
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.402

thus seith the feend. "CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.403

For certes, thanne is a man al deed in soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.404

And thus is synne acompliced by temptacioun, by delit, and by consentynge;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.405

and thanne is the synne cleped actueel.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.406

For sothe, synne is in two maneres; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.407

outher it is venial or deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.408

Soothly, whan man loveth any creature moore than Jhesu Crist oure
Creatour, thanne is it deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.409

And venial synne is it, if man love Jhesu Crist lasse than hym oghte.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.410

For sothe, the dede of this venial synne is ful perilous,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.411

for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han to God moore and moore.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.412

And therfore, if a man charge hymself with manye swiche venial synnes,
certes, but if so be that he somtyme descharge hym of hem by shrifte,
they mowe ful lightly amenuse in hym al the love that he hath to Jhesu
Crist; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.413

and in this wise skippeth venial into deedly synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.414

For certes, the moore that a man chargeth his soule with venial
synnes, the moore is he enclyned to fallen into deedly synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.415

And therfore lat us nat be necligent to deschargen us of venial synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.416

For the proverbe seith that"Manye smale maken a greet. "
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.417

And herkne this ensample.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.418

A greet wawe of the see comth som tyme with so greet a violence that it
drencheth the ship.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C1.419

And the same harm doon som tyme the smale dropes of water, that entren
thurgh a litel crevace into the thurrok, and in the botme of the ship ,
if men be so necligent that they ne descharge hem nat by <P_298.C2> tyme.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.420

And therfore, although ther be a difference bitwixe thise two causes of
drenchynge, algates the ship is dreynt.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.421

Right so fareth it somtyme of deedly synne, and of anoyouse veniale
synnes, whan they multiplie in a man so greetly that <em> the love of
<$$em> thilke worldly thynges that he loveth, thurgh whiche he synneth
venyally, is as greet in his herte as the love of God, or moore.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.422

And therfore, the love of every thyng that is nat biset in God, ne doon
principally for Goddes sake, although that a man love it lasse than God,
yet is it venial synne; and deedly synne whan the love of any thyng
weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of God, or moore.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.423

And therfore, the love of every thyng that is nat biset in God, ne doon
principally for Goddes sake, although that a man love it lasse than God,
yet is it venial synne; and deedly synne whan the love of any thyng
weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of God, or moore.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.424

"Deedly synne,"as seith Seint Augustyn,"is whan a man turneth his
herte fro God, which that is verray sovereyn bountee, that may nat
chaunge, and yeveth his herte to thyng that may chaunge and flitte.
"CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.425

And certes, that is every thyng save God of hevene.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.426

For sooth is that if a man yeve his love, the which that he oweth al
to God with al his herte, unto a creature, certes, as muche of his
love as he yeveth to thilke creature, so muche He bireveth fro God;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.427

and therfore dooth he synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.428

For he that is dettour to God ne yeldeth nat to God al his dette; that
is to seyn, al the love of his herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.429

Now sith man understondeth generally which is venial synne, thanne is it
covenable to tellen specially of synnes whiche that many a man peraventure
ne demeth hem nat synnes, and ne shryveth him nat of the same thynges,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.430

And yet natheless they been synnes, soothly, as thise clerkes writen,
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.431

this is to seyn, that at every tyme that a man eteth or drynketh moore
than suffiseth to the sustenaunce of his body, in certein he dooth synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.432

And eek whan he speketh moore than it nedeth, it is synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.433

Eke whan he herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the povre;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.434

eke whan he is in heele of body, and wol nat faste whan other folk faste,
withouten cause resonable; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.435

eke whan he slepeth moore than nedeth, or whan he comth by thilke
enchesoun to late to chirche, or to othere werkes of charite;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.436

eke whan he useth his wyf, withouten sovereyn desir of engendrure to
the honour of God, or for the entente to yelde to his wyf the dette of
his body; CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.437

eke whan he wol nat visite the sike and the prisoner, if he may;
CMCTPARS-M3,298.C2.438

eke if he love wyf or child, or oother <P_299.C1a> worldly thyng, moore
than resoun requireth; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.439

eke if he flatere or blandise moore than hym oghte for any necessitee;
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.440

eke if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of the povre;
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.441

eke if he apparailleth his mete moore deliciously than nede is, or ete
it to hastily by likerousnesse; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.442

eke if he tale vanytees at chirche or at Goddes service, or that he be
a talker of ydel wordes of folye or of vileynye, CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.443

for he shal yelden acountes of it at the day of doom;
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.444

eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do thynges that he may nat parfourne
; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.445

eke whan that he by lightnesse or folie mysseyeth or scorneth his
neighebor; CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.446

eke whan he hath any wikked suspecioun of thyng ther he ne woot of it
no soothfastnesse: CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.447

thise thynges, and no withoute nombre, been synnes, as seith Seint
Augustyn.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1a.448

Now shal men understonde that, al be it so that noon erthely man may
eschue alle venial <P_299.C2a> synnes, yet may he refreyne hym by the
brennynge love that he hath to oure Lord Jhesu Christ, and by preyeres
and confessioun and othere goode werkes, so that it shal but litel greve.
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.449

For, as seith Seint Augustyn,"If a man love God in swich manere that
al that evere he dooth is in the love of God, and for the love of God
verraily, for he brenneth in the love of God, looke, how muche that a
drope of water that falleth in a fourneys ful of fyr anoyeth or greveth
, CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.450

so muche anoyeth a venial synne unto a man that is perfit in the love
of Jhesu Crist. "CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2a.451

men may also refreyne venial synne by receyvynge worthily of the precious
body of Jhesu Crist; by receyvynge eek of hooly water, by almesdede,
by general confessioun of Confiteor at masse and at complyn, and by
blessynge of bisshopes and of preestes, and by oothere goode werkes.

CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.458

Now been they cleped chieftaynes, for as muche as they been chief and
spryng of alle othere synnes.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.459

Of the roote of thise sevene synnes, thanne, is Pride the general roote
of alle harmes.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.460

For of this roote spryngen certein braunches, as Ire, Envye, Accidie or
Slewthe, Avarice or Coveitise <paren> to commune understondynge <$$paren>
, Glotonye, and Lecherye.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.461

And everich of thise chief synnes hath his braunches and his twigges,
as shal be declared in hire chapitres folwynge.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.462

<heading>

De Superbia CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.464

<$$heading>

And thogh so be that no man kan outerly telle the nombre of the twigges
and of the harmes that cometh of Pride, yet wol I shewe a partie of hem,
as ye shul understonde.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C1b.466

<P_299.C2b>

Ther is inobedience, avauntynge, ypocrisie, despit, arrogance, inpudence,
swellynge of herte, insolence, elacioun, inpacience, strif , contumacie,
presumpcioun, Irreverence, pertinacie, veyne glorie, and many another
twig that I kan nat declare.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.468

Inobedient is he that disobeyeth for despit to the comandementz of God,
and to his sovereyns, and to his goostly fader.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.469

Avauntour is he that bosteth of the harm or of the bountee that he
hath doon.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.470

Ypocrite is he that hideth to shewe hym swich as he is, and sheweth hym
swich as he noght is.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.471

Despitous is he that hath desdeyn of his neighebor - that is to seyn,
of his evene-Cristene - or hath despit to doon that hym oghte to do.
CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.472

Arrogant is he that thynketh that he hath thilke bountees in hym that
he hath noght, or weneth that he sholde have hem by his desertes, or
elles he demeth that he be that he nys nat.  CMCTPARS-M3,299.C2b.473

Inpudent is he that for his pride hath no shame of his <P_300.C1> synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.474

Swellynge of herte is whan a man rejoyseth hym of harm that he hath doon.
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.475

Insolent is he that despiseth in his juggement alle othere folk, as
to regard of his value, and of his konnyng, and of his spekyng, and of
his beryng.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.476

Elacioun is whan he ne may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe.
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.477

Inpacient is he that wol nat been ytaught ne undernome of his vice,
and by strif werreieth trouthe wityngly, and deffendeth his folye.
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.478

Contumax is he that thurgh his indignacioun is agayns everich auctoritee
or power of hem that been his sovereyns.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.479

Presumpcioun is whan a man undertaketh an emprise that hym oghte nat do,
or elles that he may nat do; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.480

and this is called surquidrie.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.481

Irreverence is whan men do nat honour there as hem oghte to doon, and
waiten to be reverenced.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.482

Pertinacie is whan man deffendeth his folie, and truseth to muchel to
his owene wit.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.483

Veyneglorie is for to have pompe and delit in his temporeel hynesse,
and glorifie hym in this worldly estaat.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.484

Janglynge is whan a man speketh to muche biforn folk, and clappeth as
a mille, and taketh no keep what he seith.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.485

And yet is ther a privee spece of Pride, that waiteth first to be salewed
er he wole salewe, al be he lasse worth than {worth} that oother is
peraventure; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.486

and eek he waiteth or desireth to sitte, or elles to goon above hym in
the wey, or kisse pax, or been encensed, or goon to offryng biforn his
neighebor, and swiche semblable thynges, agayns his duetee, peraventure ,
but that he hath his herte and his entente in swich a proud desir to be
magnified and honoured biforn the peple.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.487

Now been ther two maneres of Pride: CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.488

that oon of hem is withinne the herte of man, CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.489

and that oother is withoute.  Of whiche, soothly, thise forseyde thynges,
and mo than I have seyd, apertenen to Pride that is in the herte of man;
CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.490

and that othere speces of Pride been withoute.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.491

But natheles that oon of thise speces of Pride is signe of that oother,
right as the gaye leefsel $at $te {TEXT:atte} taverne is signe of the
wyn that is in the celer.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C1.492

And this is in manye thynges: as in speche and contenaunce, <P_300.C2>
and in outrageous array of clothyng.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.493

For certes, if ther ne hadde be no synne in clothyng, Crist wolde nat
so soone have noted and spoken of the clothyng of thilke riche man in
the gospel.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.494

And, as seith Seint Gregorie, that"precious clothyng is cowpable for
the derthe of it, and for his softenesse, and for his strangenesse and
degisynesse, and for the superfluitee, or for the inordinat scantnesse
of it. "CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.495

Allas, may man nat seen, as in oure dayes, the synful costlewe array of
clothynge, and namely in to muche superfluite, or elles in to desordinat
scantnesse?  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.496

As to the first synne, that is in superfluitee of clothynge, which
that maketh it so deere, to harm of the peple; nat oonly the cost of
embrowdynge, the degise endentynge or barrynge, owndynge, palynge,
wyndynge or bendynge, and semblable wast of clooth in vanitee, but ther
is also costlewe furrynge in hir gownes, so muche pownsonynge of chisels
to maken holes, so muche daggynge of sheres; forthwith the superfluitee
in lengthe of the forseide gownes, trailynge in the dong and in the mire,
on horse and eek on foote, as wel of man as of womman , that al thilke
trailyng is verraily as in effect wasted, consumed, thredbare, and roten
with donge, rather than it is yeven to the povre, to greet damage of
the forseyde povre folk.  And that in sondry wise; CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.497

this is to seyn that the moore that clooth is wasted, the moore moot it
coste to the peple for the scarsnesse.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.498

And forther over, if so be that they wolde yeven swich pownsoned and
dagged clothyng to the povre folk, it is nat convenient to were for
hire estaat, ne suffisant to beete hire necessitee, to kepe hem fro the
distemperance of the firmament.  CMCTPARS-M3,300.C2.499

Upon that oother side, to speken of the horrible disordinat scantnesse
of clothyng, as been thise kutted sloppes, or haynselyns, that thurgh
hire shortnesse ne covere nat the shameful membres <P_301.C1> of man,
to wikked entente.  Allas, somme of hem shewen the boce of hir shap,
and the horrible swollen membres, that semeth lik the maladie of hirnia,
in the wrappynge of hir hoses; CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.500

and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were the hyndre part of a she-ape
in the fulle of the moone.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.501

And mooreover, the wrecched swollen membres that they shewe thurgh
disgisynge, in departynge of hire hoses in whit and reed, semeth that
half hir shameful privee membres weren flayne.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.502

And if so be that they departen hire hoses in othere colours, as is
whit and blak, or whit and blew, or blak and reed, and so forth, thanne
semeth it, as by variaunce of colour, that half the partie of hire
privee membres were corrupt by the fir of Seint Antony, or by cancre,
or by oother swich meschaunce.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.503

Of the hyndre part of hir buttokes, it is ful horrible for to see.
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.504

For certes, in that partie of hir body ther as they purgen hir stynkynge
ordure, that foule partie shewe they to the peple prowdly in despit of
honestitee, which honestitee that Jhesu Crist and his freendes observede
to shewen in hir lyve.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.505

Now, as of the outrageous array of wommen, God woot that though the
visages of somme of hem seme ful chaast and debonaire, yet notifie they
in hire array of atyr likerousnesse and pride.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.506

I sey nat that honestitee in clothynge of man or womman is uncovenable,
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.507

but certes the superfluitee or disordinat scantitee of clothynge is
reprevable.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.508

Also the synne of aornement or of apparaille is in thynges that apertenen
to ridynge, as in to manye delicat horses that been hoolden for delit,
that been so faire, fatte, and costlewe; and also in many a vicious
knave that is sustened by cause of hem; and in to curious harneys, as
in sadeles, in crouperes, peytrels, and bridles covered with precious
clothyng, and riche barres and plates of gold and of silver.  For which
God seith by Zakarie the prophete,"I wol confounde the rideres of swiche
horses. "CMCTPARS-M3,301.C1.509

This folk taken litel reward of the ridynge of Goddes sone of hevene
, <P_301.C2> and of his harneys whan he rood upon the asse, and ne
hadde noon oother harneys but the povre clothes of his disciples;
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.510

ne we ne rede nat that evere he rood on oother beest.
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.511

I speke this for the synne of superfluitee, and nat for resonable
honestitee, whan reson it requireth.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.512

And forther over, certes, pride is greetly notified in holdynge of greet
meynee, whan they be of litel profit or of right no profit, and namely
whan that meynee is felonous and damageous to the peple by hardynesse
of heigh lordshipe or by wey of offices.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.513

For certes, swiche lordes sellen thanne hir lordshipe to the devel of
helle, whanne they sustenen the wikkednesse of hir meynee.  Or elles ,
whan this folk of lowe degree, as thilke that holden hostelries, sustenen
the thefte of hire hostilers, CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.514

and that is in many manere of deceites.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.515

Thilke manere of folk been the flyes that folwen the hony, or elles the
houndes that folwen the careyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.516

Swich forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes; for which thus
seith David the prophete: CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.517

"Wikked deeth moote come upon thilke lordshipes, CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.518

and God yeve that they moote descenden into helle al doun,
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.519

for in hire houses been iniquitees and shrewednesses and nat God of
hevene. "CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.520

And certes, but if they doon amendement, right as God yaf his benysoun
to $Laban by the service of Jacob, and to $Pharao by the service of
Joseph, right so God wol yeve his malisoun to swiche lordshipes as
sustenen the wikkednesse of hir servauntz, but they come to amendement.
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.521

Pride of the table appeereth eek ful ofte; for certes, riche men
been cleped to festes, and povre folk been put awey and rebuked.
Also in excesse of diverse metes and drynkes, and namely swich manere
bake-metes and dissh-metes, brennynge of wilde fir and peynted and
castelled with papir, and semblable wast, so that it is abusioun for
to thynke.  And eek in to greet preciousnesse of vessel and curiositee of
mynstralcie, by whiche a man is stired the moore to delices of luxurie ,
CMCTPARS-M3,301.C2.522

if so be that he sette his herte <P_302.C1> the lasse upon oure Lord
Jhesu Crist, certeyn it is a synne; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.523

and certeinly the delices myghte been so grete in this caas that man
myghte lightly falle by hem into deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.524

The especes that sourden of Pride, soothly whan they sourden of malice
ymagined, avised, and forncast, or elles of usage, been deedly synnes ,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.525

it is no doute.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.526

and whan they sourden by freletee unavysed, and sodeynly withdrawen ayeyn
, al been they grevouse synnes, I gesse that they ne been nat deedly.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.527

Now myghte men axe wherof that pride sourdeth and spryngeth,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.528

and I seye, somtyme it spryngeth of the goodes of nature, and
somtyme of the goodes of fortune, and somtyme of the goodes of grace.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.529

Certes, the goodes of nature stonden outher in goodes of body or in
goodes of soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.530

Certes, goodes of body been heele of body, strengthe, delivernesse,
beautee, gentrice, franchise.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.531

goodes of nature of the soule been good wit, sharp understondynge,
subtil engyn, vertu natureel, good memorie.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.532

goodes of fortune been richesse, hyghe degrees of lordshipes, preisynges
of the peple.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.533

Goodes of grace been science, power to suffre spiritueel travaille,
benignitee, vertuous contemplacioun, withstondynge of temptacioun, and
semblable thynges.  of whiche forseyde goodes, certes it is a ful greet
folye a man to priden hym in any of hem alle.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.534

Now as for to speken of goodes of nature, God woot that somtyme
we han hem in nature as muche to oure damage as to oure profit.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.535

As for to speken of heele of body, certes it passeth ful lightly,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.536

and eek it is ful ofte enchesoun of the siknesse of oure soule.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.537

For, God woot, the flessh is a ful greet enemy to the soule,
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.538

and therfore, the moore that the body is hool, the moore be we in peril
to falle.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.539

Eke for to pride hym in his strengthe of body, it is an heigh folye.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.540

For certes, the flessh coveiteth agayn the spirit, CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.541

and ay the moore strong that the flessh is, the sorier may the soule be.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.542

And over al this, strengthe of body and worldly hardynesse causeth ful
ofte many a man to peril and meschaunce.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.543

Eek for to pride hym of his gentrie is ful greet folie;
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.544

for Ofte tyme the gentrie of the body binymeth the gentrie of the soule
; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.545

and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o mooder; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C1.546

and alle we been of o nature, roten and corrupt, bothe riche and
<P_302.C2> povre.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.547

For sothe, o manere gentrie is for to Preise, that apparailleth mannes
corage with vertues and moralitees, and maketh hym Cristes child.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.548

For truste wel that over what man that synne hath maistrie, he is a
verray cherl to synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.549

Now been ther generale signes of gentillesse, as eschewynge of vice
and ribaudye and servage of synne, in word, in werk, and contenaunce,
and usynge vertu, curteisye, and clennesse, and to be liberal - that is
to seyn, large by mesure - CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.550

For thilke that passeth mesure is folie and synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.551

Another is to remembre hym of bountee, that he of oother folk hath
receyved.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.552

another is to be benigne to his goode subetis; wherfore seith Senek ,"Ther
is no thing moore covenable to a man of heigh estaat than debonairetee
and pitee.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.553

And therfore thise flyes that men clepen bees, whan they maken hir
kyng, they chesen oon that hath no prikke wherwith he may stynge.
"CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.554

Another is, a man to have a noble herte and a diligent, to attayne to
heighe vertuouse thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.555

Now certes, a man to pride hym in the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous
folie, CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.556

for thilke yifte of grace that sholde have turned hym to goodnesse and to
medicine, turneth hym to venym and to confusioun, as seith Seint Gregorie.
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.557

Certes also, whoso prideth hym in the goodes of fortune, he is a ful
greet fool; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.558

for somtyme is a man a greet Lord by the morwe, that is a caytyf and a
wrecche er it be nyght; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.559

and somtyme the richesse of a man is cause of his deth;
CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.560

somtyme the delices of a man ben cause of the grevous maladye thurgh
which he dyeth.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.561

Certes, the commendacioun of the peple is somtyme ful fals and ful brotel
for to triste; CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.562

this day they preyse, CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.563

tomorwe they blame.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.564

God woot, desir to have commendacioun eek of the peple hath caused deeth
to many a bisy man.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.565

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Superbie.  CMCTPARS-M3,302.C2.567

<$$heading>

Now sith that so is that ye han understonde what is Pride, and whiche
been the speces of it, And whennes Pride sourdeth and spryngeth, now
shul ye understonde which is <P_303.C1> the remedie agayns the synne of
Pride; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.569

and that is hymylitee, or mekenesse.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.570

That is a vertu thurgh which a man hath verray knoweleche of hymself,
and holdeth of hymself no pris ne deyntee, as in regard of his desertes,
considerynge evere his freletee.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.571

Now been ther three maneres of hymylitee: as humylitee in herte;
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.572

another hymylitee is in his mouth; the thridde in his werkes.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.573

The humilitee in herte is in foure maneres.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.574

That oon is whan a man holdeth hymself as noght worth biforn God of
hevene.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.575

Another is whan he ne despiseth noon oother man.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.576

The thridde is whan he rekketh nat, though men holde hym noght worth.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.577

The ferthe is whan he nys nat sory of his humiliacioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.578

Also the humilitee of mouth is in foure thynges: in attempree speche , and
in humblesse of speche, and whan he biknoweth with his owene mouth that he
is swich as hym thynketh that he is in his herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.579

Another is whan he preiseth the bountee of another man,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.580

and nothyng therof Amenuseth.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.581

Humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.582

The firste is whan he putteth othere men biforn hym.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.583

The seconde is to chese the loweste place over al.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.584

The thridde is gladly to assente to good conseil.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.585

The Ferthe is to stonde gladly to the award of his sovereyns, or of hym
that is in hyer degree.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.586

Certein, this is a greet werk of hymylitee.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.587

<heading>

Sequitur de Invidia.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.589

<$$heading>

After Pride wol I speken of the foule synne of Envye, which that is,
as by the word of the Philosophre,"sorwe of oother mannes prosperitee
"; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.591

and after the word of Seint Augustyn, it is"Sorwe of oother mennes wele,
and joye of othere mennes harm. "CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.592

This foule synne is platly agayns the Hooly Goost.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.593

Al be it so that every Synne is agayns the Hooly Goost, yet nathelees,
for as muche as bountee aperteneth proprely to the Hooly Goost, and Envye
comth proprely of malice, therfore it is proprely agayn the bountee of
the Hooly Goost.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.594

Now hath malice two speces; that is to seyn, hardnesse of herte in
wikkednesse, CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.595

or elles the flessh of man is so blynd that he considereth nat that he
is in synne, or rekketh nat that he is in synne, which is the hardnesse
of the devel.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C1.596

That <P_303.C2> oother spece of malice is whan a man werreyeth trouthe,
whan he woot that it is trouthe; and eek whan he werreyeth the grace
that God hath yeve to his neighebor; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.597

and al this is by Envye.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.598

Certes, thanne is Envye the worste synne that is.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.599

For soothly, alle othere synnes been somtyme oonly agayns o special
vertu, CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.600

but certes, envye is agayns alle vertues and agayns alle goodnesses.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.601

For it is sory of alle the bountees of his neighebor,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.602

and in this manere it is divers from alle othere synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.603

For wel unnethe is ther any synne that it ne hath som delit in itself
, save oonly Envye, that evere hath in itself angwissh and sorwe.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.604

The speces of Envye been thise.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.605

Ther is first, sorwe of oother mannes goodnesse and of his prosperitee ;
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.606

and prosperitee is kyndely matere of joye; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.607

thanne is envye a synne agayns kynde.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.608

The seconde spece of Envye is joye of oother mannes harm,
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.609

and that is proprely lyk to the devel, that evere rejoyseth hym of
mannes harm.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.610

Of thise two speces comth bakbityng; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.611

and this synne of bakbityng or detraccion hath certeine speces, as thus
: CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.612

Som man preiseth his neighebor by a wikked entente, CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.613

for he maketh alwey a wikked knotte $at $te {TEXT:atte} laste ende.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.614

Alwey he maketh a"but"$at $te {TEXT:atte} laste ende, that is digne of
moore blame, than worth is al the preisynge.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.615

The seconde spece is that if a man be good, and dooth or seith a thing
to good entente, the bakbitere wol turne al thilke Goodnesse up-so-doun
to his shrewed entente.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.616

The thridde is to amenuse the bountee of his neighebor.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.617

The fourthe spece of bakbityng is this: that if men speke goodnesse of a
man, thanne wol the bakbitere seyn,"Parfey, swich a man is yet bet than
he,"in dispreisynge of hym that men preise.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.618

The fifte spece is this: for to consente gladly and herkne gladly to
the harm that men speke of oother folk.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.619

This synne is ful greet CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.620

and ay encreesseth after the wikked entente of the bakbitere.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.621

After bakbityng cometh gruchchyng or murmuracioun; CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.622

and somtyme it spryngeth of inpacience agayns God, and som-tyme agayns
man.  CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.623

Agayn God it is, whan a man gruccheth agayn the peyne of helle, or agayns
poverte, or los of catel, or agayn reyn or tempest; or elles gruccheth
that shrewes han prosperitee, or elles for the goode men han adversitee.
CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.624

And alle thise thynges sholde man suffre paciently, CMCTPARS-M3,303.C2.625

for they comen by the rightful juggement and <P_304.C1> ordinaunce of God.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.626

Somtyme comth grucching of avarice; as judas grucched agayns the
magdaleyne, whan she enoynted the heved of oure Lord Jhesu Crist with
hir precious oynement.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.627

This manere murmure is swich as whan man gruccheth of goodnesse
that hymself dooth, or that oother folk doon of hir owene catel.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.628

Somtyme comth murmure of Pride; as whan Simon the Pharisse gruchched
agayn the Magdaleyne, whan she approched to Jhesu Crist and weep at his
feet for hire synnes.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.629

And somtyme grucchyng sourdeth of Envye, whan men discovereth a
mannes harm that was pryvee or bereth hym on hond thyng that is fals.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.630

Murmure eek is ofte amonges servauntz that grucchen whan hir sovereyns
bidden hem doon leveful thynges; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.631

And forasmuche as they dar nat openly withseye the comaundementz of
hir sovereyns, yet wol they seyn harm, and grucche, and murmure prively
for verray despit; whiche wordes men clepen the develes Pater noster ,
though so be that the devel ne hadde nevere Pater noster, but that lewed
folk yeven it swich a name.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.632

Somtyme it comth of Ire or prive hate, that norisseth rancour in herte,
as afterward I shal declare.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.633

Thanne cometh eek bitternesse of herte, thurgh which bitternesse
every good dede of his neighebor semeth to hym bitter and unsavory.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.634

Thanne cometh discord, that unbyndeth alle manere of freendshipe.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.635

Thanne comth scornynge of his neighebor, al do he never so weel.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.636

Thanne comth accusynge, as whan man seketh occasioun to anoyen his
neighebor, which that is lyk the craft of the devel, that waiteth bothe
Nyght and day to accusen us alle.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.637

Thanne Comth malignitee, thurgh which a man anoyeth his neighebor prively,
if he may; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.638

and if he noght may, algate his wikked wil ne shal nat wante, as for
to brennen his hous pryvely, or empoysone or sleen his beestes, and
semblable thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.639

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Invidie.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.641

<$$heading>

Now wol I speke of remedie agayns this foule synne of Envye.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.643

First is the love of God principal, and lovyng of his neighebor as
hymself, CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.644

for soothly, that oon ne may nat been withoute that oother.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C1.645

And truste wel that in the name of thy neighebor thou shalt <P_304.C2>
understonde the name of thy brother; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.646

for certes alle we have o fader flesshly, and o mooder - That is to seyn,
adam and eve - and eek o fader espiritueel, CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.647

and that is God of hevene.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.648

Thy neighebor $art $tow {TEXT:artow} holden for to love, and wilne hym
alle goodnesse; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.649

and therfore seith God,"Love thy neighebor as thyselve"- that is to seyn,
to salvacioun bothe of lyf and of soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.650

And mooreover thou shalt love hym in word, and in benigne amonestynge
and chastisynge, And conforten hym in his anoyes, and preye for hym with
al thyn herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.651

And in dede thou shalt love hym in swich wise that thou shalt doon to
hym in charitee as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene persone.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.652

And therfore thou ne shalt doon hym no damage in wikked word, ne harm
in his body, ne in his catel, ne in his soule, by entissyng of wikked
ensample.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.653

Thou shalt nat desiren his wyf, ne none of his thynges.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.654

Understoond eek that in the name of neighebor is comprehended his enemy.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.655

Certes, man shal loven his enemy, by the comandement of God;
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.656

and soothyly thy freend $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} love in God.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.657

I seye, thyn enemy $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} love for goddes sake,
by his comandement.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.658

For if it were reson that man sholde haten his enemy, for sothe God nolde
nat receyven us to his love that been his enemys.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.659

Agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym, he shal doon
three thynges, as thus: CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.660

Agayns hate and rancour of herte, he shal love hym in herte.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.661

Agayns chidyng and wikkede wordes, he shal preye for his enemy.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.662

Agayns the wikked dede of his enemy, he shal doon hym bountee.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.663

for Crist seith,"Loveth youre enemys, CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.664

and preyeth for hem that speke yow harm, and eek for hem that yow chacen
and pursewen, CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.665

and dooth bountee to hem that yow haten. "CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.666

Loo, thus comaundeth us oure Lord Jhesu Crist to do to oure enemys.
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.667

For soothly, nature dryveth us to loven oure freends,
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.668

and parfey, oure enemys han moore nede to love than oure freendes;
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.669

and they that moore nede have, certes to hem shal men doon goodnesse;
CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.670

and certes, in thilke dede have we remembraunce of the love of Jhesu
Crist that deyde for his enemys.  CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.671

And in as muche as thilke love is the moore grevous to parfourne, so
muche is the moore gret the merite; CMCTPARS-M3,304.C2.672

and therfore <P_305.C1> the lovynge of oure enemy hath confounded the
venym of the devel.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.673

For right as the devel is disconfited by humylitee, right so is he
wounded to the deeth by love of oure enemy.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.674

Certes, thanne is love the medicine that casteth out the venym of Envye
fro mannes herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.675

The speces of this paas shullen be moore largely declared in hir
chapitres folwynge.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.676

<heading>

Sequitur de Ira CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.678

<$$heading>

After Envye wol I discryven the synne of Ire.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.680

For soothly, whoso hath envye upon his neighebor, anon he wole comunly
fynde hym a matere of wratthe, in word or in dede, agayns hym to whom
he hath envye.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.681

And as wel Comth Ire of Pride, as of Envye, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.682

for soothly, he that is proud or envyous is lightly wrooth.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.683

This synne of Ire, after the discryvyng of Seint Augustyn, is wikked
wil to been avenged by word, or by dede.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.684

Ire, after the Philosophre, is the fervent blood of man yquyked
in his herte, thurgh which he wole harm to hym that he hateth.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.685

For certes, the herte of man, by eschawfynge and moevynge of his
blood, wexeth so trouble that he is out of alle juggement of resoun.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.686

But ye shal understonde that Ire is in two maneres; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.687

that oon of hem is good, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.688

and that oother is wikked.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.689

The goode Ire is by jalousie of goodnesse, thurgh which a man is wrooth
with wikkednesse and agayns wikkednesse; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.690

and therfore seith a wys man that Ire is bet than pley.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.691

This Ire is with debonairetee, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.692

and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse; nat wrooth agayns the man,
but wrooth with the mysdede of the man, as seith the prophete David,
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.693

"Irascimini et nolite peccare. "CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.694

Now understondeth that wikked Ire is in two maneres; that is to seyn,
sodeyn Ire or hastif Ire, withouten avisement and consentynge of resoun.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.695

The menyng and the sens of this is, that the resoun of a man ne consente
nat to thilke sodeyn Ire; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.696

and thanne is it venial.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.697

Another Ire is ful wikked, that comth of felonie of herte avysed and
cast biforn, with wikked wil to do vengeance, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.698

and therto his resoun consenteth; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C1.699

and <P_305.C2> soothly this is deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.700

This Ire is so displesant to God that it troubleth his hous
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.701

and chaceth the Hooly Goost out of mannes soule, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.702

and wasteth and destroyeth the liknesse of God - that is to seyn, the
vertu that is in Mannes soule - CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.703

and put in hym the liknesse of the devel, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.704

and bynymeth the man fro God, that is his rightful lord.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.705

This Ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.706

for it is the develes fourneys, that is eschawfed with the fir of helle.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.707

For certes, right so as fir is moore mighty to destroyen erthely
thynges than any oother element, right so Ire is myghty to destroyen
alle spiritueel thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.708

Looke how That fir of smale gleedes, that been almost dede under
asshen, wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brymstoon;
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.709

right so Ire wol everemo quyken agayn, whan it is touched by the pride
that is covered in mannes herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.710

For certes, fir ne may nat comen out of no thyng, but if it were first
in the same thyng natureely, as fir is drawen out of flyntes with steel.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.711

And right so as pride is ofte tyme matere of Ire, right so is rancour
norice and kepere of Ire.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.712

Ther is a maner tree, as seith Seint ysidre, that whan men maken fir of
thilke tree, and covere the coles of it with asshen, soothly the fir of
it wol lasten a yeer or moore.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.713

And right so fareth it of rancour; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.714

whan it is ones conceyved in the hertes of som men, certein, it wol
lasten peraventure from oon Estre day unto another Estre day, and moore.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.715

But certes, thilke man is ful fer fro the mercy of God al thilke while.
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.716

in this forseyde develes fourneys ther forgen three shrewes: Pride,
that ay bloweth and encreesseth the fir by chidynge and wikked wordes;
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.717

thanne stant Envye CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.718

and holdeth the hoote iren upon the herte of man with a peire of longe
toonges of long rancour; CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.719

and thanne stant the synne of Contumelie, or strif and cheeste,
CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.720

and batereth and forgeth by vileyns reprevynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.721

Certes, this cursed synne annoyeth bothe to the man hymself and eek to
his neighebor.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.722

For soothly, almoost al the harm that any man dooth to his neighebor
comth of wratthe.  CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.723

For certes, outrageous wratthe dooth al that evere the devel hym
comaundeth, CMCTPARS-M3,305.C2.724

for he ne spareth neigher Crist ne <P_306.C1> his sweete Mooder.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.725

And in his outrageous anger and ire - allas, allas!  - ful many oon at
that tyme feeleth in his herte ful wikkedly, bothe of Crist and eek of
alle his halwes.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.726

Is nat this a cursed vice?  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.727

Yis, certes.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.728

Allas!  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.729

It bynymeth from man his wit and his resoun, and al his debonaire lif
espiritueel that sholde kepen his soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.730

Certes, it bynymeth eek goddes due lordshipe, CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.731

and that is mannes soule, and the love of his neighebores.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.732

It stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.733

It reveth hym the quiete of his herte, CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.734

and subverteth his soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.735

of Ire comen thise stynkynge engendrures: First, hate, that is oold
wratthe; discord, thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he
hath loved ful longe; CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.736

and thanne cometh werre, and every manere of wrong that man dooth to
his neighebor, in body or in catel.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.737

Of this cursed synne of Ire cometh eek manslaughtre.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.738

And understonde wel that homycide, that is manslaughtre, is in diverse
wise.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.739

Som manere of homycide is spiritueel, CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.740

and som is bodily.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.741

Spiritueel manslaughtre is in sixe thynges.  First by hate, as seith
Seint john: CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.742

"He that hateth his brother is an homycide. "CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.743

Homycide is eek by babkbitynge, of whiche bakbiteres seith Salomon
that"they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hire neighebores.
"CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.744

For soothly, as wikke is to bynyme his good name as his lyf.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.745

Homycide is eek in yevynge of wikked conseil by fraude, as for to
yeven conseil to areysen wrongful custumes and taillages.  Of whiche
seith Salomon,"Leon rorynge and bere hongry been like to the crueel
lordshipes"in witholdynge or abreggynge of the shepe <paren> or the
hyre <$$paren>, or of the wages of sevauntz, or elles in usure, or in
withdrawynge of the almesse of povre folk.  For which the wise man seith
,"Fedeth hym that almoost dyeth for honger"; CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.746

for soothly, but if thow feede hym, thou sleest hym;
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.747

and alle thise been deedly synnes.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.748

Bodily manslaughtre is, whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in oother
manere; as whan thou comandest to sleen a man, or elles yevest hym
conseil to sleen a man.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.749

Manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.750

That oon is by lawe, right as a justice dampneth hym that is coupable
to the deeth.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C1.751

But lat the justice be war that he do it rightfully, and that he do it nat
for delit to <P_306.C2> spille blood, but for kepynge of rightwisnesse.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.752

Another homycide is that is doon for necessitee, as whan o man sleeth
another in his defendaunt, and that he ne may noon ootherwise escape
from his owene deeth.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.753

But certeinly if he may escape withouten slaughtre of his adversarie,
and sleeth hym, he dooth synne CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.754

and he shal bere penance as for deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.755

Eek if a man, by caas or aventure, shete an arwe, Or caste a stoon,
with which he sleeth a man, he is homycide.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.756

Eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hire child in hir slepyng,
it is homycide and deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.757

Eek whan man destourbeth concepcioun of a Child, and maketh a womman
outher bareyne By drynkynge venenouse herbes thurgh which she may nat
conceyve, or sleeth a child by Drynkes wilfully, or elles putteth certeine
material thynges in hire secree places to slee the child, or elles dooth
unkyndely synne, by which man or womman shedeth hire nature in manere or
in place ther as a child may nat be conceived, or elles if a woman have
conceyved, and hurt hirself and sleeth the child, yet is it homycide.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.758

What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for drede of
worldly shame?  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.759

certes, an horrible homicide.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.760

Homycide is eek if a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherie,
thurgh which the child is perissed, or elles smyteth a womman wityngly,
thurgh which she leseth hir child.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.761

Alle thise been homycides and horrible deedly synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.762

Yet comen ther of Ire manye mo synnes, as wel in word as in thoght and
in dede; as he that arretteth upon God, or blameth God of thyng of which
he is hymself gilty, or despiseth God and alle his halwes, as Doon thise
cursede hasardours in diverse contrees.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.763

This cursed synne doon they, whan they feelen in hir herte ful wikkedly
of God and of his halwes.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.764

Also whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter, Thilke
synne is so greet that unnethe may it been releessed, but that the mercy
of God passeth alle his werkes; CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.765

it is so greet, and he so benigne.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.766

Thanne comth of Ire attry angre.  CMCTPARS-M3,306.C2.767

whan a man is sharply amonested in his shrifte to forleten his synne ,
thanne wole he be angry, and answeren hokerly and angrily, and <P_307.C1>
deffenden or excusen his synne by unstedefastnesse of his flessh;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.768

or elles he dide it for to holde compaignye with his felawes;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.769

or elles, he seith, the feend enticed hym; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.770

or elles he Dide it for his youthe; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.771

or elles his compleccioun is so corageous that he may nat forbere;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.772

or elles it is his destinee, as he seith, unto a certein age;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.773

or elles, he seith, it cometh hym of gentillesse of his auncestres;
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.774

and semblable thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.775

Alle thise manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir synnes that they ne wol
nat delivere hemself.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.776

For soothly, no wight that excuseth hym wilfully of his synne may nat
been delivered of his synne, til that he mekely biknoweth his synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.777

After this, thanne cometh sweryng, that is expres agayn the comandement
of God; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.778

and this bifalleth ofte of anger and of Ire.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.779

God seith,"Thow shalt nat take the name of thy Lord God in veyn or in
ydel. "CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.780

Also oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith, by the word of Seint Mathew,"Ne wol
ye nat swere in alle manere; neither by hevene, for it is goddes trone;
ne by erthe, for it is the bench of his feet; ne by jerusalem, for it
is the citee of a greet kyng; ne by thyn heed, for thou mayst nat make
an heer whit ne blak.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.781

But seyeth by youre word'ye, ye,'and'nay, nay'; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.782

and what that is moore, it is of yvel, - thus seith Crist.
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.783

For Cristes sake, ne swereth nat so synfully in dismembrynge of Crist
by soule, herte, bones, and body.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.784

For certes, it semeth that ye thynke that the cursede jewes ne dismembred
nat ynough the preciouse persone of Crist, CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.785

but ye dismembre hym moore.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.786

And if so be that the lawe compelle yow to swere, thanne rule yow after
the lawe of God in youre sweriyng, as seith jeremye, quarto capitulo:
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.787

thou shalt kepe three condicions: CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.788

thou shalt swere"in trouthe, in doom, and in rightwisnesse. " This is
to seyn, thou shalt swere sooth; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.789

for every lesynge is agayns Crist; CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.790

for Crist is verray trouthe.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.791

And thynk wel this, that"every greet swerere, nat compedded lawefully
to swere, the wounde shal nat departe from his hous"whil he useth swich
unleveful swerying.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.792

Thou shalt sweren eek in doom, whan thou art constreyned by thy domesman
to witnessen the trouthe.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C1.793

Eek thow shalt nat swere for envye, ne for favour, ne for meede, but
for rightwisnesse, for declaracioun <P_307.C2> of it, to the worshipe
of God and helpyng of thyne evene-Cristene.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.794

And therefore every man that taketh Goddes name in ydel, or falsly
swereth with his mouth, or elles taketh on hym the name of Crist, to be
called a Cristen man, and lyveth agayns Cristes lyvynge and his techynge,
alle they taken Goddes name in ydel.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.795

Looke eek what Seint Peter seith, CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.796

Actuum quarto, CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.797

Non est aliud nomen sub celo, etc., CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.798

"Ther nys noon oother name,"seith Seint Peter,"under hevene yeven to
men, in which they mowe be saved"; that is to seyn, but the name of
Jhesu Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.799

Take kep eek how precious is the name of Crist, as seith Seint Paul,
ad Philipenses secundo, CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.800

in nomine Jhesu, etc., CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.801

"That in the name of Jhesu every knee of hevenely creatures, or erthely ,
or of helle sholde bowe,"CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.802

for it is so heigh and so worshipful that the cursede feend in helle
sholde tremblen to heeren it ynempned.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.803

Thanne semeth it that men that sweren so horribly by his blessed
name , that they despise it moore booldely than dide the cursede
Jewes , or elles the devel, that trembleth whan he heereth his name.
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.804

Now certes, sith that sweryng, but if it be lawefully doon, is so
heighly deffended, muche worse is forsweryng falsly, and yet nedelees.
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.805

What seye we eek of hem that deliten hem in sweryng, and holden it a
gentrie or a manly dede to swere grete othes?  And what of hem that
of verray usage ne cesse nat to swere grete othes, al be the cause nat
worth a straw?  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.806

Certes, this is horrible synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.807

Swerynge sodeynly withoute avysement is eek a Synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.808

But lat us go now to thilke horrible sweryng of adjuracioun and
conjuracioun, as doon thise false enchauntours or nigromanciens in
bacyns ful of water, or in a bright swerd, in a cercle, or in a fir,
or in a shulderboon of a sheep.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.809

I kan nat seye but that they doon cursedly and dampnably agayns Crist
and al the feith of hooly chirche.  CMCTPARS-M3,307.C2.810

What seye we of hem that bileeven on divynailes, as by flight or by
noyse of briddes, or of beestes, or by sort, by nigromancie, by dremes,
by chirkynge of dores or crakkynge <P_308.C1> of houses, by gnawynge of
rattes, and swich manere wrecchednesse?  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.811

Certes, al this thyng is deffended by God and by hooly chirche.  For which
they been acursed, til they come to amendement, that on swich filthe
setten hire bileeve.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.812

Charmes for woundes or maladie of men or of beestes, if they taken any
effect, it may be peraventure that God suffreth it, CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.813

for folk sholden yeve the moore feith and reverence to his name.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.814

Now wol I speken of lesynges, which generally is fals signyficaunce of
word, in entente to deceyven his evene-Cristene.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.815

Som lesynge is of which ther comth noon avantage to no wight;
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.816

and som lesynge turneth to the ese and profit of o man, and to disese
and damage of another man.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.817

Another lesynge is for to saven his lyf or his catel.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.818

Another lesynge comth of delit for to lye, in which delit they wol forge
a long tale, and peynten it with alle circumstaunces, where al the ground
of the tale is fals.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.819

Som lesynge comth, for he wole sustene his word; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.820

and som lesynge comth of reccheleesnesse withouten avisement;
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.821

and semblable thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.822

Lat us now touche the vice of flaterynge, which ne comth nat gladly but
for drede or for coveitise.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.823

Flaterye is generally wrongful preisynge.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.824

Flatereres been the develes norices, that norissen his children with
milk losengerie.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.825

For sothe, Salomon seith that"Flaterie is wors than detraccioun.
"CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.826

For somtyme detraccion maketh an hauteyn man be the moore humble,
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.827

for he dredeth detraccion; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.828

but certes flaterye, that maketh a man to enhauncen his herte and his
contenance.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.829

Flatereres been the develes enchauntours; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.830

for they make a man to wene of hymself be lyk that he nys nat lyk.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.831

They been lyk to Judas that bitraysen a man to sellen hym to his enemy;
that is to the devel.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.832

Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that syngen evere placebo.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.833

I rekene flaterie in the vices of Ire; CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.834

for ofte tyme, if o man be wrooth with another, thanne wole he flatere
som wight to sustene hym in his querele.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.835

Speke we now of swich cursynge as comth of irous herte.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.836

Malisoun generally may be seyd every maner power of harm.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C1.837

Swich cursynge bireveth man fro the regne of God, as <P_308.C2> seith
Seint Paul.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.838

and ofte tyme swiche cursynge wrongfully retorneth agayn to hym
that curseth, as a bryd that retorneth agayn to his owene nest.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.839

And over alle thyng men oghten eschewe to cursen hir children,
and yeven to the devel hire engendrure, as ferforth as in hem is.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.840

Certes, it is greet peril and greet synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.841

Lat us thanne speken of chidynge and reproche, whiche been ful grete
woundes in mannes herte, CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.842

for they unsowen the semes of freendshipe in mannes herte.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.843

For certes, unnethes may a man pleynly been accorded with hym that hath
hym openly revyled and repreved and disclaundred.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.844

This is a ful grisly synne, as Crist seith in the gospel.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.845

And taak kep now, that he that repreveth his neighebor, outher
he repreveth hym by som harm of peyne that he hath on his
body, as"mesel,""croked harlot,"or by som synne that he dooth.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.846

Now if he repreve hym by harm of peyne, thanne turneth the repreve to
Jhesu Crist, CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.847

for peyne is sent by the rightwys sonde of God, and by his suffrance,
be it meselrie, or maheym, or maladie.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.848

And if he repreve hym uncharitably of synne, as"thou holour,""
thou dronkelewe harlot,"and so forth, thanne aperteneth that to the
rejoysynge of the devel, that evere hath joyde that men doon synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.849

And certes, chidynge may nat come but out of a vileyns herte.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.850

For after the habundance of the herte speketh the mouth ful ofte.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.851

And ye shul understonde that looke, by any wey, whan any man shal
chastise another, that he be war from chidynge or reprevynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.852

For trewely, but he be war, he may ful lightly quyken the fir of angre
and of wratthe, which that he sholde quenche, CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.853

and peraventure sleeth hym, which that he myghte chastise with benignitee.
CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.854

For as seith Salomon,"the amyable tonge is the tree of lyf"- that is to
seyn, of lyf espiritueel - CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.855

and soothly, a deslavee tonge sleeth spirites of hym that repreveth and
eek of hym that is repreved.  CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.856

loo, what seith Seint Augustyn: CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.857

"Ther is nothyng so lyk the develes child as he that ofte chideth.
"CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.858

Seint Paul seith eek,"The servant of God bihoveth nat to chide.
"CMCTPARS-M3,308.C2.859

And how that chidynge be a vileyns thyng bitwixe alle manere folk,
<P_309.C1> yet is it certes moost uncovenable bitwixe a man and his wyf
, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.860

for there is nevere reste.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.861

And therfore seith Salomon,"An hous that is uncovered and droppynge,
and a chidynge wyf, been lyke. "CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.862

A man that is in a droppynge hous in manye places, though he eschewe
the droppynge in a place, it droppeth on hym in another place.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.863

So fareth it by a chydynge wyf; CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.864

but she chide hym in o place, she wol chide hym in another.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.865

And therfore,"Bettre is a morsel of breed with joye than an hous ful of
delices with chidynge,"seith Salomon.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.866

Seint Paul seith,"O ye wommen, be ye subgetes to youre housbondes as
bihoveth in God, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.867

and ye men loveth youre wyves. "CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.868

Ad Colossenses tertio.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.869

Afterward speke we of scornynge, which is a wikked synne, and namely
whan he scorneth a man for his goode werkes.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.870

For certes, swiche scorneres faren lyk the foule tode, that may nat
endure to smelle the soote savour of the vyne whanne it florissheth.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.871

Thise scorneres been partyng felawes with the Devel;
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.872

for they han joye whan the devel wynneth, and sorwe whan he leseth.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.873

They been adversaries of Jhesu Crist, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.874

for they haten that he loveth - that is to seyn, salvacioun of soule.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.875

speke we now of wikked conseil, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.876

for he that wikked conseil yeveth is a traytour.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.877

For he deceyveth hym that trusteth in hym, ut Achitofel ad Absolonem.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.878

But nathelees, yet is his wikked conseil first agayn hymself.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.879

for, as seith the wise man,"Every fals lyvynge hath this propertee in
hymself, that he that wole anoye another man, he anoyeth first hymself.
"CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.880

And men shul understonde that man shal nat taken his conseil of fals folk
, ne of angry folk, or grevous folk, ne of folk that loven specially to
muchel hir owene profit, ne to muche worldly folk, namely in conseilynge
of soules.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.881

Now comth the synne of hem that sowen and maken discord amounges folk,
which is a synne that Crist hateth outrely.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.882

And no wonder is, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.883

for he deyde for to make concord.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.884

And moore shame do they to Crist, than dide they that hym crucifiede,
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C1.885

for God loveth bettre that <P_309.C2> freendshipe be amonges folk,
than he dide his owene body, the which that he yaf for unitee.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.886

Therfore been they likned to the devel, that evere is aboute to maken
discord.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.887

Now comth the synne of double tonge, swiche as speken faire byforn folk,
and wikkedly bihynde, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.888

or elles they maken semblant as though they speeke of good entencioun,
or Elles in game and pley, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.889

and yet they speke of wikked entente.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.890

Now comth biwreying of conseil, thurgh which a man is defamed;
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.891

certes, unnethe may he restoore the damage.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.892

Now comth manace, that is an open folye, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.893

for he that ofte manaceth, he threteth moore than he may parfourne ful
ofte tyme.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.894

Now cometh ydel wordes, that is withouten profit of hym that speketh tho
wordes, and eek of hym that herkneth tho wordes.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.895

Or elles ydel wordes been tho that been nedelees, or withouten entente
of natureel profit.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.896

And al be it that ydel wordes been somtyme venial synne, yet sholde men
douten hem, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.897

for we shul yeve rekenynge of hem bifore God.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.898

Now comth janglynge, that may nat been withoute synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.899

And, as seith Salomon,"It is a sygne of apert folye. "
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.900

And therfore a philosophre seyde, whan men axed hym how that men sholde
plese the peple, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.901

and he answerde,"Do manye goode werkes, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.902

and spek fewe jangles. "CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.903

After this comth the synne of japeres, that been the develes apes,
CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.904

for they maken folk to laughe at hire japerie as folk doon at the gawdes
of an ape.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.905

swiche japes deffendeth Seint Paul.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.906

looke how that vertuouse wordes and hooly conforten hem that travaillen
in the service of Crist, CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.907

right so conforten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of japeris hem that
travaillen in the service of the devel.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.908

Thise been the synnes that comen of the tonge that comen of Ire and of
othere synnes mo.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.909

<heading>

Sequitur remedium contra peccatum Ire.  CMCTPARS-M3,309.C2.911

<$$heading>

The remedie agayns Ire is a vertu that men clepen mansuetude, that is
debonairette; and <P_310.C1> eek another vertu, that men callen pacience
or suffrance.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.913

Debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth the stirynges and the moevynges
of mannes corage in his herte, in swich manere that they ne skippe nat
out by angre ne by ire.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.914

Suffrance suffreth swetely alle the anoyaunces And the wronges that men
doon to man outward.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.915

Seint Jerome seith thus of debonairetee, that"it dooth noon harm to no
wight ne seith; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.916

ne for noon harm that men doon or seyn, he ne eschawfeth nat agayns his
resoun. "CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.917

This vertu somtyme comth of nature, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.918

for, as seith the Philosophre,"A man is a quyk thyng, by nature debonaire
and tretable to goodnesse; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.919

but whan debonairetee is enformed of grace, thanne is it the moore
worth. "CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.920

Pacience, that is another remedie agayns Ire, is a vertu that suffreth
swetely every mannes goodnesse, and is nat wrooth for noon harm that is
doon to hym.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.921

The Philosophre seith that pacience is thilke vertu that suffreth
debonairely alle the outrages of adversitee and every wikked word.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.922

This vertu maketh a man lyk to God, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.923

and maketh hym Goddes owene deere child, as seith Crist.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.924

This vertu disconfiteth thyn enemy.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.925

And therfore seith the wise man,"If thow wolt venquysse thyn enemy,
lerne to suffre. "CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.926

And thou shalt understonde that man suffreth foure manere of grevances
in outward thynges, agayns the whiche foure he moot have foure manere
of paciences.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.927

The firste grevance is of wikkede wordes.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.928

Thilke suffrede Jhesu Crist withouten grucchyng, ful paciently, whan
the jewes despised and repreved hym ful ofte.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.929

suffre thou therfore paciently; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.930

for the wise man seith,"If thou stryve with a fool, though the fool
be wrooth or though he laughe, algate thou shalt have no reste.
"CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.931

That oother grevance outward is to have damage of thy catel.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.932

Theragayns suffred Crist ful paciently, whan he was despoyled of al that
he hadde in this lyf, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.933

and that nas but his clothes.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.934

The thridde grevance is a man to have harm in his body.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.935

That suffred Crist ful paciently in al his passioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C1.936

The fourthe grevance is in outrageous labour in werkes.  wherfore I seye
that folk that maken <P_310.C2> hir servantz to travaillen to grevously
, or out of tyme, as on haly dayes, soothly they do greet synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.937

Heer-agayns suffred Crist ful paciently CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.938

and taughte us pacience, whan he baar upon his blissed shulder the croys
upon which he sholde suffren despitous deeth.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.939

Heere may men lerne to be pacient, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.940

for certes noght oonly Cristen men been pacient, for love of Jhesu
Crist, and for gerdoun of the blisful lyf that is perdurable,
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.941

but certes, the olde payens that nevere were Cristene, commendeden and
useden the vertu of pacience.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.942

A philosophre upon a tyme, that wolde have beten his disciple for his
grete trespas, for which he was greetly amoeved, broghte a yerde to
scoure with the child; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.943

and whan this child saugh the yerde, he seyde to his maister,"What thenke
ye do? "CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.944

"I wol bete thee,"quod the maister,"for thy correccioun.

"For sothe,"quod the child,"ye oghten first correcte youreself , that han

"For sothe,"quod the maister al wepynge,"thow seyst sooth.

"Have thow the yerde, my deere sone, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.948

of pacience comth obedience, thurgh which a man is obedient to
Crist and to alle hem to whiche he oghte to been obedient in Crist.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.950

And understond wel that obedience is perfit, whan that a man dooth
gladly and hastily, with good herte entierly, al that he sholde do.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.951

Obedience generally is to parfourne the doctrine of God and of his
sovereyns, to whiche hym oghte to ben obeisaunt in alle rightwisnesse.

Sequitur de Accidia.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.954

<$$heading>

After the synne of Envye and of Ire, now Wol I speken of the synne
of Accidie.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.956

For Envye blyndeth the herte of a man, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.957

and Ire troubleth a man, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.958

and Accidie maketh hym hevy, thoghtful, and wraw.  CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.959

Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte, which bitternesse is
mooder of Accidie, and bynymeth hym the love of alle goodnesse.
CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.960

Thanne is Accidie the angwissh of troubled herte; CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.961

and Seint Augustyn seith,"It is anoy of goodnesse and ioye of harm.
"CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.962

Certes, this is a dampnable synne, CMCTPARS-M3,310.C2.963

For it dooth wrong to Jhesu Crist, in as muche <P_311.C1> as it bynymeth
the service that men oghte doon to Crist with alle diligence, as seith
Salomon.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.964

But Accidie dooth no swich diligence.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.965

He dooth alle thyng with anoy, and with wrawnesse, slaknesse, and
excusacioun, and with ydelnesse, and unlust; for which the book
seith,"Acursed be he that dooth the service of God necligently.
"CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.966

thanne is Accidie enemy to everich estaat of man, CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.967

for certes, the estaat of man is in three maneres.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.968

Outher it is th'estaat of innocence, as was th'estaat of adam biforn
that he fil into synne; in which estaat he was holden to wirche as in
heriynge and adowrynge of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.969

Another estaat is the estaat of synful men, in which estaat men
been holden to laboure in preiynge to God for amendement of hire
synnes, and that he wole graunte hem to arysen out of hir synnes.
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.970

Another estaat is th'estaat of grace, in which estaat he is holden to
werkes of penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.971

And certes, to alle thise thynges is Accidie enemy and contrarie,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.972

for he loveth no bisynesse at al.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.973

Now certes this foule synne Accidie, is eek a ful greet enemy to the
liflode of the body, CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.974

for it ne hath no purveaunce agayn temporeel necessitee,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.975

for it forsleweth and forsluggeth and destroyeth alle goodes temporeles
by reccheleesnesse.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.976

The fourthe thyng is that accidie is lyk hem that been in the
peyne of helle, by cause of hir slouthe and of hire hevynesse,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.977

for they that been dampned been so bounde that they ne may neither wel
do ne wel thynke.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.978

Of Accidie comth first, that a man is anoyed and encombred for to doon
any goodnesse, and maketh that God hath abhomynacion of swich Accidie,
as seith Seint john.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.979

Now comth Slouthe, that wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne no penaunce.
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.980

For soothly, Slouthe is so tendre and so delicaat, as seith Salomon,
that he wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne penaunce, CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.981

and therfore he shendeth al that he dooth.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.982

Agayns this roten-herted synne of Accidie and Slouthe sholde men exercise
hemself to doon goode werkes, and manly and vertuously cacchen corage wel
to doon, thynkynge that oure Lord Jhesu Crist quiteth every good dede,
be it never so lite.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C1.983

Usage of labour is <P_311.C2> a greet thyng, CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.984

for it maketh, as seith Seint bernard, the laborer to have stronge armes
and harde synwes; CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.985

and slouthe maketh hem feble and tendre.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.986

Thanne comth drede to bigynne to werke anye goode werkes.
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.987

For certes, he that is enclyned to synne, hym thynketh it is so
greet an emprise for to undertake to doon werkes of goodnesse,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.988

and casteth in his herte that the circumstances of goodnesse been so
grevouse and so chargeaunt for to suffre, that he dar nat undertake to
do werkes of goodnesse, as seith Seint Gregorie.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.989

Now comth wanhope, that is despeir of the mercy of God, that comth somtyme
of to muche outrageous sorwe, and somtyme of to muche drede, ymaginynge
that he hath doon so muche synne that it wol nat availlen hym, though he
wolde repenten hym and forsake synne, thurgh which despeir or drede he
abaundoneth al his herte to every maner synne, as seith Seint augustin.
Which dampnable synne, if that it continue unto his ende, it is cleped
synnyng in the Hooly Goost.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.990

This horrible synne is so perilous that he that is despeired, ther nys
no felonye ne no synne that he douteth for to do; as shewed wel by judas.
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.991

Certes, aboven alle synnes thanne is this synne moost displesant to Crist,
and moost adversarie.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.992

Soothly, he that despeireth hym is lyk the coward champioun recreant,
that seith,"creant"withoute nede, CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.993

Allas, Allas, nedeles is he recreant and nedelees despeired.
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.994

Certes, the mercy of God is evere redy to the penitent,
CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.995

and is aboven alle his werkes.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.996

Allas, kan a man nat bithynke hym on the gospel of Seint luc, 15, where
as Crist seith that"as wel shal ther be joye in hevene upon a synful man
that dooth penitence, as upon nynty and nyne Rightful men that neden no
penitence. "CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.997

Looke forther, in the same gospel, the joye And the feeste of the goode
man that hadde lost his sone, whan his sone with repentaunce was retourned
to his fader.  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.998

Kan they nat remembren hem eek that, as seith Seint luc, 23, how that the
theef that was hanged bisyde Jhesu Crist, seyde,"Lord, remembre of me,
whan thow comest into thy regne"?  CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.999

"For sothe,"seyde Crist,"I seye to thee, to-day $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow}
been with me in paradys. "CMCTPARS-M3,311.C2.1000

Certes, <P_312.C1> ther is noon so horrible synne of man that it ne may
in his lyf be destroyed by penitence, thurgh vertu of the passion and
of the deeth of Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1001

Allas, what nedeth man thanne to been despeired, sith that his mercy so
redy is and large?  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1002

Axe and have.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1003

Thanne cometh sompnolence, that is, sloggy slombrynge, which maketh a
man be hevy and dul in body and in soule, CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1004

and this synne comth of Slouthe.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1005

And certes, the tyme that, by wey of resoun, men sholde nat slepe, that is
by the morwe, but if ther were cause resonable.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1006

For soothly, the morwe tyde is moost covenable a man to seye his preyeres,
and for to thynken on God, and for to honoure God, and to yeven almesse to
the povre that first cometh in the name of Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1007

Lo, what seith Salomon: CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1008

"Whoso wolde by the morwe awaken and seke me, he shal fynde.
"CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1009

Thanne cometh necligence, or reccheleesnesse, that rekketh of no thyng.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1010

And how that ignoraunce be mooder of alle harm, certes, necligence is
the norice.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1011

Necligence ne dooth no fors, whan he shal doon a thyng, wheither he do
it weel or baddely.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1012

Of the remedie of thise two synnes, as seith the wise man, that"
He that dredeth God, he spareth nat to doon that him oghte doon.
"CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1013

And he that loveth God, he wol doon diligence to plese God by his
werkes, and abaundone hymself, with al his myght, wel for to doon.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1014

Thanne comth ydelnesse, that is the yate of alle harmes.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1015

An ydel man is lyk to a place that hath no walles; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1016

the develes may entre on every syde, or sheten at hym at discovert,
by temptacion on every syde.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1017

This ydelnesse is the thurrok of alle wikked and vileyns thoghtes,
and of alle jangles, trufles, and of alle ordure.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1018

Certes, the hevene is yeven to hem that wol labouren, and nat to ydel
folk.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1019

Eek David seith that"they ne been nat in the labour of men,
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1020

ne they shul nat been whipped with men"- that is to seyn, in purgatorie.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1021

Certes, thanne semeth it they shul be tormented with the devel in helle,
but if they doon penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1022

Thanne comth the synne that men clepen tarditas, as whan a man is to
laterede or tariynge er he wole turne to God, CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1023

and certes, that is a greet folie.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1024

He is lyk to hym that falleth in the dych, and wol nat arise.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C1.1025

And this vice <P_312.C2> comth of a fals hope, that he thynketh that he
shal lyve longe; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1026

but that hope faileth ful ofte.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1027

Thanne comth lachesse; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1028

that is he, that Whan he biginneth any good werk, anon he shal forleten it
and stynten; as doon they that han any wight to governe, and ne taken
of hym namoore kep, anon as they fynden any contrarie or any anoy.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1029

Thise been the newe sheepherdes that leten hir sheep wityngly go renne to
the wolf that is in the breres, or do no fors of hir owene governaunce.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1030

Of this comth poverte and destruccioun, bothe of spiritueel and temporeel
thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1031

Thanne comth a manere cooldnesse, that freseth al the herte of a man.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1032

Thanne comth undevoccioun, thurgh which a man is so blent, as seith Seint
Bernard, and hath swich languour in soule that he may neither rede ne
singe in hooly chirche, ne heere ne thynke of no devoioun, ne travaille
with his handes in no good werk, that it nys hym unsavory and al apalled.
CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1033

Thanne wexeth he slough and slombry, CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1034

and soone wol be wrooth, CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1035

and soone is enclyned to hate and to envye.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1036

Thanne comth the synne of worldly sorwe, swich as is cleped tristicia,
that sleeth man, as seith Seint Paul.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1037

For certes, swich sorwe werketh to the deeth of the soule and of the
body also; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1038

for therof comth that a man is anoyed of his owene lif.  Wherfore swich
sorwe shorteth ful ofte the lif of man, er that his tyme be come by wey
of kynde.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1039

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Accidie.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1041

<$$heading>

Agayns this horrible synne of Accidie, an the branches of the same, ther
is a vertu that is called fortitudo or strentthe, that is an affeccioun
thurgh which a man despiseth anoyouse thinges.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1043

This vertu is so myghty and so vigerous that it dar withstonde myghtily
and wisely kepen hymself fro perils that been wikked, and wrastle agayn
the assautes of the devel.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1044

For It enhaunceth and enforceth the soule, right as Accidie abateth it
and maketh it fieble.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1045

For this fortitudo may endure by long suffraunce the travailles that
been covenable.  CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1046

This vertu hath manye speces; CMCTPARS-M3,312.C2.1047

and the firste is cleped magnanimitee, that is to seyn, <P_313.C1>
greet corage.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1048

For certes, ther bihoveth greet corage agains Accidie, lest that it
ne swolwe the soule by the synne of sorwe, or destroye it by wanhope.
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1049

This vertu maketh folk to undertake harde thynges and grevouse thynges,
by hir owene wil, wisely and resonably.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1050

And for as muchel as the devel fighteth agayns a man moore by queyntise
and by sleighte than by strengthe, therfore men shal withstonden hym by
wit and by resoun and by discrecioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1051

Thanne arn ther the vertues of feith and hope in God and in his seintes
, to acheve and acomplice the goode werkes in the whiche he purposeth
fermely to continue.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1052

Thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse; CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1053

and that is whan a man ne douteth no travaille in tyme comynge of the
goode werkes that a man hath bigonne.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1054

Thanne comth magnificence, that is to seyn, whan a man dooth and
parfourneth grete werkes of goodnesse; CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1055

and that is the ende why that men sholde do goode werkes,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1056

for in the acomplissynge of grete goode werkes lith the grete gerdoun.
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1057

Thanne is ther constaunce, that is, stablenesse of corage,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1058

and this sholde been in herte by stedefast feith, and in mouth, and in
berynge, and in chiere, and in dede.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1059

Eke ther been mo speciale remedies against Accidie in diverse werkes,
and in consideracioun of the peynes of helle and of the joyes of hevene
, and in the trust of the grace of the Holy Goost, that wole yeve hym
myght to parfourne his goode entente.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1060

<heading>

Sequitur de Avaricia.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1062

<$$heading>

After Accidie wol I speke of Avarice and of Coveitise, of which
synne seith Seint Paul that"the roote of alle harmes is Coveitise.
"CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1064

Ad Thimotheum Sexto.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1065

For soothly, whan the herte of a man is confounded in itself and troubled
, and that the soule hath lost the confort of God, thanne seketh he an
ydel solas of worldly thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1066

Avarice, after the descripcioun of Seint Augustyn, is a likerousnesse
in herte to have erthely thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1067

Som oother folk seyn that Avarice is for to purchacen manye erthely
thynges, and no thyng yeve to hem that han nede.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1068

And understoond that Avarice ne stant nat oonly in lond ne catel, but
somtyme in science and in glorie, CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1069

and in every manere of outrageous thyng is Avarice and Coveitise.
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C1.1070

<P_313.C2>

And the difference bitwixe Avarice and Coveitise is this:
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1072

Coveitise is for to coveite swiche thynges as thou hast nat;
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1073

and Avarice is for to withholde and kepe swiche thynges as thou hast,
withoute rightful nede.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1074

Soothly, this Avarice is a synne that is ful dampnable,
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1075

for al hooly writ curseth it, CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1076

and speketh agayns that vice; CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1077

for it dooth wrong to Jhesu Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1078

for it bireveth hym the love that men to hym owen, CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1079

and turneth it bakward agayns alle resoun, CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1080

and maketh that the avaricious man hath moore hope in his catel than in
Jhesu Crist, and dooth moore observance in kepynge of his tresor than
he dooth to the service of Jhesu Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1081

and therfore seith Seint Paul Ad Ephesios quinto, that an avaricious
man is in the thraldom of ydolatrie.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1082

what difference is bitwixe an ydolastre and an avaricious man, but
that an ydolastre, per aventure, ne hath but o mawmet or two, and the
avaricious man hath manye?  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1083

For certes, every floryn in his cofre is his mawmet.
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1084

And certes, the synne of mawmettrie is the firste thyng that God deffended
in the ten comaundementz as bereth witnesse in Exodi capitulo vicesimo:
CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1085

"Thou shalt have no false goddes bifore me, CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1086

ne thou shalt make to thee no grave thyng. "CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1087

Thus is an avaricious man, that loveth his tresor biforn God, an
ydolastre, thurgh this cursed synne of avarice.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1088

Of Coveitise comen thise harde lordshipes, thurgh whiche men been
distreyned by taylages, custumes, and cariages, moore than hire duetee
or resoun is.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1089

And eek taken they of hire bonde-men amercimentz, whiche myghten moore
resonably ben cleped extorcions than amercimentz.  Of whiche amercimentz
and raunsonynge of boonde-men somme lordes stywards seyn that it is
ryghtful, for as muche as a cherl hath no temporeel thyng that it ne is
his lordes, as they seyn.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1090

But certes, thise lordshipes doon wrong that bireven hire bondefolk
thynges that they nevere yave hem.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1091

Augustinus, De Civitate libro nono.  CMCTPARS-M3,313.C2.1092

"Sooth is that the condicioun of thraldom and the firste <P_314.C1>
cause of thraldom is for synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1093

Genesis nono.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1094

Thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth thraldom, but nat nature.
"Wherfore thise lordes ne sholde nat muche glorifien hem in hir
lordshipes, sith that by natureel condicion they been nat lordes
over thralles, but that thraldom comth first by the desert of synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1095

And forther over, ther as the lawe seith that temporeel goodes of
boonde-folk been the goodes of hir lordeshipes, ye, that is for to
understonde, the goodes of the emperour, to deffenden hem in hir right,
but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1096

And therfore seith seneca,"Thy prudence sholde lyve benignely with thy
thralles. "CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1097

Thilke that thou clepest thy thralles been goddes peple,
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1098

for humble folk been Cristes freendes; CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1099

they been contubernyal with the Lord.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1100

Thynk eek that of swich seed as {of} cherles spryngen, of swich seed
spryngen lordes.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1101

As wel may the cherl be saved as the lord.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1102

the same deeth that taketh the cherl, swich deeth taketh the lord.
Wherfore I rede, do right so with the cherl, as thou woldest that thy
lord dide with thee, if thou were in his plit.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1103

Every synful man is a cherl to synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1104

I rede thee, certes, that thou, Lord, werke in swich wise with thy
cherles that they rather love thee than drede.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1105

I woot wel ther is degree above degree, as reson is,
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1106

and skile is that men do hir devoir ther as it is due,
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1107

but certes, extorcions and despit of youre underlynges is dampnable.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1108

And forther over, understoond wel that thise conquerours or tirauntz
maken ful ofte thralles of hem that been born of as roial blood as {of}
been they that hem conqueren.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1109

this name of thraldom was nevere erst kowth, til that noe seyde
that his sone Canaan sholde be thral to his bretheren for his synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1110

What seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon extorcions to hooly
chirche?  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1111

Certes, the swerd that men yeven first to a knyght, whan he is newe
dubbed, signifieth that he sholde deffenden hooly chirche, and nat robben
it ne pilen it; CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1112

and whoso dooth is traitour to Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1113

And, as seith Seint Augustyn,"They been the develes wolves that stranglen
the sheep of Jhesu Crist,"CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1114

and doon worse than wolves.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C1.1115

<P_314.C2>

For soothly, whan the wolf hath ful his wombe, he styntheth to strangle
sheep.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1117

But soothly, the pilours and destroyours of the godes of hooly chirche
no do nat so, CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1118

for they ne stynte nevere to pile.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1119

Now as I have seyd, sith so is that synne was first cause of
thraldom, thanne is it thus, that thilke tyme that al this world
was in synne, thanne was al this world in thraldom and subjeccioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1120

But certes, sith the time of grace cam, God ordeyned that som folk
sholde be moore heigh in estaat and in degree, and som folk moore lough
, and that everich sholde be served in his estaat and in his degree.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1121

And therfore in somme contrees, ther they byen thralles, whan they han
turned hem to the feith, they maken hire thralles free out of thraldom.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1122

And therfore, certes, the Lord oweth to his man that the man oweth to
his lord.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1123

The Pope calleth hymself servant of the servantz of God;
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1124

but for as muche as the estaat of hooly chirche ne myghte nat han be,
Ne the commune profit myghte nat han be kept, ne pees and rest in erthe,
but if God hadde ordeyned that som men hadde hyer degree and som men lower
, therfore was sovereyntee ordeyned, to kepe and mayntene and deffenden
hire underlynges or hire subgetz in resoun, as ferforth as it lith in
hire power, and nat to destroyen hem ne confounde.  wherfore I seye that
thilke lordes that been lyk wolves, that devouren the possessiouns or
the catel of povre folk wrongfully, withouten mercy or mesure, They shul
receyven, by the same mesure that {by} they han mesured to povre folk,
the mercy of Jhesu Crist, but if it be amended.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1125

now comth deciete bitwixe marchaunt and marchant.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1126

And thow shalt understonde that marchandise is in manye maneres;
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1127

that oon is bodily, CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1128

and that oother is goostly; CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1129

that oon is honest and leveful, CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1130

and that oother is deshonest and unleveful.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1131

of thilke bodily marchandise that is leveful and honest is this: that
, there as God hath ordeyned that a regne or a contree is suffisaunt
to hymself, thanne is it honest and leveful that of habundaunce of
this contree, that men helpe another contree that is moore needy.
CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1132

And therfore ther moote been marchantz to bryngen fro that o contree to
that oother hire marchandises.  CMCTPARS-M3,314.C2.1133

That oother marchandise, that men haunten with fraude and <P_315.C1>
trecherie and deceite, with lesynges and false othes, is cursed and
dampnable.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1134

Espiritueel marchandise is proprely symonue, that is, ententif desir to
byen thyng espiritueel, that is, thyng that aperteneth to the seintuarie
of God and to cure of the soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1135

this desir, if so be that a man do his diligence to parfournen it, al be
it that his desir ne take noon effect, yet is it to hym a deedly synne;
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1136

and if he be ordred, he is irreguleer.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1137

Certes symonye is cleped of simon magus, that wolde han boght for
temporeel catel the yifte that God hadde yeven, by the Hooly Goost,
to Seint Peter and to the apostles.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1138

And therfore understoond that bothe he that selleth and he that beyeth
thynges espirituels been cleped symonyals, be it by catel, be it by
procurynge, or by flesshly preyere of his freendes, flesshly freendes,
or espiritueel freendes: CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1139

Flesshly in two maneres; as by kynrede, or othere freendes.
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1140

Soothly, if they praye for hym that is nat worthy and able, it is symonye,
if he take the benefice; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1141

and if he be worthy and able, ther nys noon.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1142

that oother manere is whan men or wommen preyen for folk to avauncen hem
, oonly for wikked flesshly affeccioun that they han unto the persone,
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1143

and that is foul symonye.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1144

But certes, in service, for which men yeven thynges espirituels unto hir
servauntz, it moot been understonde that the service moot been honest,
and elles nat; and eek that it be withouten bargaynynge, and that the
persone be able.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1145

For, as seith Seint Damasie,"Alle the synnes of the world, at regard of
this synne, arn as thyng of noght. "CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1146

For it is the gretteste synne that may be, after the synne of lucifer
and anteCrist.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1147

For by this synne God forleseth the chirche and the soule that he boghte
with his precious blood, by hem that yeven chirches to hem that been
nat digne.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1148

For they putten in theves that stelen the soules of Jhesu Crist and
destroyen his patrimoyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1149

by swiche undigne preestes and curates han lewed men the lasse reverence
of the sacramentz of hooly chirche; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C1.1150

and <P_315.C2> swiche yeveres of chirches putten out the children of
Crist CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1151

and putten into the chirche the develes owene sone.
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1152

They sellen the soules that lambes sholde kepen to the wolf that
strangleth hem.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1153

And therfore shul they nevere han part of the pasture of lambes, that
is the blisse of hevene.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1154

Now comth hasardrie with his Apurtenaunces, as tables and rafles, of which
comth deceite, false othes, chidynges, and alle ravynes , blasphemynge
and reneiynge of God, and hate of his neighebores, wast of goodes,
mysspendynge of tyme, and somtyme manslaughtre.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1155

Certes, hasardours ne mowe nat been withouten greet synne whiles they
haunte that craft.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1156

Of Avarice comen eek lesynges, thefte, fals witnesse, and false othes.
CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1157

And ye shul understonde that thise been grete synnes and expres agayn
the comaundementz of God, as I have seyd.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1158

Fals witnesse is in word and eek in dede.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1159

In word, as for to bireve thy neighebores goode name by thy fals
witnessyng, or bireven hym his catel or his heritage by thy fals
witnessyng, whan thou for ire, or for meede, or for envye, berest fals
Witnesse, or accusest hym or excusest hym by thy fals witnesse, or elles
excusest thyself falsly.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1160

ware yow, questemongeres and notaries!  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1161

Certes, for fals witnessyng was Susanna in ful gret sorwe and peyne,
and many another mo.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1162

The synne of thefte is eek expres agayns goddes heeste, and that in two
maneres, corporeel or spiritueel.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1163

Corporeel, as for to take thy neighebores catel agayn his wyl, be it by
force or by sleighte, be it by met or by mesure; by stelyng eek of false
enditementz upon hym, and in borwynge of thy neighebores catel, in entente
nevere to payen it agayn, and semblable thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1164

Espiritueel thefte is sacrilege; that is to seyn, hurtynge of hooly
thynges, or of thynges sacred to Crist, in two maneres: by reson of
the hooly place, as chirches or chirche-hawes, for which every vileyns
synne that men doon in swiche places may be cleped sacrilege, or every
violence in the semblable places; CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1165

also, they that withdrawen falsly the rightes that longen to hooly
chirche.  CMCTPARS-M3,315.C2.1166

And pleynly and generally, sacrilege <P_316.C1> is to reven hooly thyng
fro hooly place, or unhooly thyng out of hooly place, or hooly thing
out of unhooly place.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1167

<heading>

Relevacio contra peccatum Avaricie.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1169

<$$heading>

Now shul ye understonde that the releevynge of Avarice is misericorde,
and pitee largely taken.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1171

And men myghten axe why that misericorde and pitee is releevynge of
Avarice.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1172

Certes, the avricious man sheweth no pitee ne misericorde to the nedeful
man, CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1173

for he deliteth hym in the kepynge of his tresor, and nat in the
rescowynge ne releevynge of his evene-Cristen.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1174

And therfore speke I first of misericorde.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1175

Thanne is misericorde, as seith the Philosophre, a vertu by which
the corage of a man is stired by the mysese of hym that is mysesed.
Upon which misericorde folweth pitee in parfournynge of charitable werkes
of misericorde.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1176

And certes, thise thynges moeven a man to the misericorde of Jhesu Crist ,
that he yaf hymself for oure gilt, and suffred deeth for misericorde ,
and forgaf us oure originale synnes, and therby relessed us fro the
peynes of helle, and amenused the peynes of purgatorie by penitence,
and yeveth grace wel to do, and $at $te {TEXT:atte} laste the blisse
of hevene.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1177

the speces of misericorde been, as for to lene and for to yeve, and to
foryeven and relesse, and for to han pitee in herte And compassioun of
the meschief of his evene-Cristene, and eek to chastise, there as nede is.
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1178

another manere of remedie agayns Avarice is resonable largesse;
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1179

but soothly, heere bihoveth the consideracioun of the grace of Jhesu
Crist, and of his temporeel goodes, And eek of the goodes perdurables,
that Crist yaf to us; and to han remembrance of the deeth that he shal
receyve, he noot whanne, where, ne how; and eek that he shal forgon
al that he hath, save oonly that he hath despended in goode werkes.
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1180

But for as muche as som folk been unmesurable, men oghten eschue
fool-largesse, that men clepen wast.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1181

Certes, he that is fool-large ne yeveth nat his catel,
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1182

but he leseth his catel.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C1.1183

Soothly, what thyng that he yeveth for veyne glorie, as to mynstrals
and to folk, for to beren his renoun in the world, he hath synne therof,
<P_316.C2> and noon almesse.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1184

Certes, he leseth foule his good, that ne seketh with the yifte of his
good nothyng but synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1185

He is lyk to an hors that seketh rather to drynken drovy or trouble water
than for to drynken water of the clere welle.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1186

and for as muchel as they yeven ther as they sholde nat yeven, to hem
aperteneth thilke malisoun that Crist shal yeven at the day of doom to
hem that shullen been dampned.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1187

Sequitur de Gula CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1189

<$$heading>

After Avarice comth Glotonye, which is expres eek agayn the comandement
of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1191

Glotonye is unmesurable appetit to ete or to drynke, or elles to doon
ynogh to the unmesurable appetit and desordeynee coveitise to eten or
to drynke.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1192

This synne corrumped al this world, as is wel shewed in the synne of
Adam and of Eve.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1193

Looke eek what seith Seint Paul, of Glotonye: CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1194

"Manye,"seith Seint Paul,"goon, of whiche I have ofte seyd to yow ,
and now I seye it wepynge, that been the enemys of the croys of Crist
; of whiche the ende is deeth, and of whiche hire wombe is hire God,
and hire glorie in confusioun of hem that so savouren erthely thynges.
"CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1195

He that is usaunt to this synne of glotonye, he ne may no synne
withstonde.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1196

He moot been in servage of alle vices, CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1197

for it is the develes hoord ther he hideth hym and resteth.
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1198

This synne hath manye speces.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1199

The firste is dronkenesse, that is the horrible sepulture of mannes
resoun; CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1200

and therfore, whan a man is dronken, he hath lost his resoun;
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1201

and this is deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1202

But soothly, whan that a man is nat wont to strong drynke, and peraventure
ne knoweth nat the strengthe of the drynke, or hath feblesse in his
heed, or hath travailed, thurgh which he drynketh the moore, al be
he sodeynly caught with drynke, it is no deedly synne, but venyal.
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1203

The seconde spece of glotonye is that the spirit of a man wexeth al
trouble, CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1204

For dronkenesse bireveth hym the discrecioun of his wit.
CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1205

The thridde spece of glotonye is whan a man devoureth his mete, and hath
no rightful manere of etynge.  CMCTPARS-M3,316.C2.1206

The fourthe is whan, Thurgh the grete habundaunce of his mete, <P_317.C1>
the humours in his body been distempred.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1207

The fifthe is foryetelnesse by to muchel drynkynge; for which somtymee a
man foryeteth er the morwe what he dide at even, or on the nyght biforn.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1208

In oother manere been distinct the speces of glotonye, after Seint
Gregorie.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1209

The firste is for to ete biforn tyme to ete.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1210

The seconde is whan a man get hym to delicaat mete or drynke.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1211

The thridde is whan men taken to muche over mesure.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1212

The fourthe is curiositee, with greet entente to maken and apparaillen
his mete.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1213

The fifthe is for to eten to gredily.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1214

Thise been the fyve fyngres of the develes Hand, by whiche he draweth

Remedium contra peccatum Gule.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1217

<$$heading>

Agayns Glotonye is the remedie abstinence, as seith galien;
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1219

but that holde I nat meritorie, if he do it oonly for the heele of
his body.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1220

Seint Augustyn wole that abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1221

"Abstinence,"he seith,"is litel worth, but if a man have good wil
therto, and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee, and that
men doon it for Godes sake, and in hope to have the blisse of hevene.
"CMCTPARS-M3,317.C1.1222

The felawes of abstinence been attemperaunce, that holdeth the meene
in alle thynges; eek shame, that aschueth alle deshonestee; surfisance,
that seketh no riche metes ne drynkes, ne dooth no fors of to outrageous
appariailynge of mete; mesure also, that restreyneth by resoun the
deslavee appetit of etynge; sobrenesse also, that restreyneth the outrage
of drynke; sparynge also, that restreyneth the delacaat ese to sitte
longe at his mete and softely, wherfore some folk stonden of hir owene

for thise two synnes been so ny cosyns that ofte <P_317.C2> tyme they

God woot, this Synne is ful displesaunt thyng to God,
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1229

for he seyde hymself,"Do no lecherie. "CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1230

And therfore he putte grete peynes agayns this synne in the olde lawe.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1231

If womman thral were taken in this synne, she sholde be beten with staves
to the deeth; CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1232

and if she were a gentil womman, she sholde be slayn with stones;
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1233

and if she were a bisshoppes doghter, she sholde been brent, by Goddes
comandement.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1234

Forther over, by the synne of lecherie God dreynte al the world at
the diluge.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1235

And after that he brente fyve citees with thonder-leyt,
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1236

and sank hem into helle.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1237

Now lat us speke thanne of thilke stynkynge synne of lecherie that men
clepe avowtrie of wedded folk; that is to seyn, if that oon of hem be
wedded, or elles bothe.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1238

Seint John seith that avowtiers shullen been in helle, in a stank
brennynge of fyr and of brymston - in fyr for hire lecherye, in brymston
for the stynk of hire ordure.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1239

Certes, the brekynge of this sacrement is an horrible thyng.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1240

It was maked of God hymself in paradys, and confermed by Jhesu Crist,
as witnesseth Seint Mathew in the gospel: CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1241

"A man shal lete fader and mooder, and taken hym to his wif,
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1242

and they shullen be two in o flesh. "CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1243

This sacrement bitokneth the knyttynge togidre of Crist and of hooly
chirche.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1244

And nat oonly that God forbad avowtrie in dede, CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1245

but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy neighebores wyf.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1246

"In this heeste,"seith Seint Augustyn,"is forboden alle manere coveitise

Lo, what seith Seint Mathew in the gospel, that"whose seeth a womman
to coveitise of his lust, he hath doon lecherie with hire in his herte.
"CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1248

Heere may ye seen that nat oonly the dede of this synne is forboden,
but eek the desire to doon that synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1249

This cursed synne anoyeth grevousliche hem that it haunten.  And first
to hire soule, CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1250

for he obligeth it to synne and to peyne of deeth that is perdurable.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1251

Unto the body anoyeth it grevously also, CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1252

for it dreyeth hym, CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1253

and wasteth him, CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1254

and shent hym, CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1255

and of his blood he maketh sacrifice to the feend of helle.
CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1256

It wasteth eek his catel and his substaunce.  CMCTPARS-M3,317.C2.1257

And certes, if it be a foul thyng a man to waste his catel on wommen,
yet is it a fouler thyng whan that, for <P_318.C1> swich ordure, wommen
dispenden upon men hir catel and substaunce.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1258

This synne, as seith the prophete, bireveth man and womman hir goode

and it is ful plesaunt to the devel, CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1260

for therby wynneth he the mooste partie of this world.

And right as a marchant deliteth hym moost in chaffare that he

CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1262

This is that oother hand of the devel with fyve fyngres to cacche the

for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the herte.
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1266

The seconde fynger is the vileyns touchynge in wikkede manere.
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1267

And therfore seith Salomon that"whoso toucheth and handleth a womman,
he fareth lyk hym that handleth the scorpioun that styngeth and sodeynly
sleeth thurgh his envenymynge"; as whoso toucheth warm pych, it shent
his fyngres.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1268

The thridde is foule wordes, that fareth lyk fyr, that right anon brenneth
the herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1269

The fourthe fynger is the kissynge; CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1270

and trewely he were a greet fool that wolde kisse the mouth of a brennynge
oven or of a fourneys.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1271

And moore fooles been they that kissen in vileynye,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1272

for that mouth is the mouth of helle; CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1273

and namely thise olde dotardes holours, yet wol they kisse, though they
may nat do, and smatre hem.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1274

Certes, they been lyk to houndes; CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1275

for an hound, whan he comth by the roser or by othere $bushes, though
he may nat pisse, yet wole he heve up his leg and make a contenaunce
to pisse.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1276

And for that many man weneth that he may nat synne, for no likerousnesse
that he dooth with his wyf, CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1277

certes, that opinion is fals.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1278

God woot, a man may sleen hymself with his owene knyf, and make hymselve
dronken of his owene tonne.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1279

Certes, be it wyf, be it child, or any worldly thyng that he loveth
biforn God, it is his mawmet, CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1280

and he is an ydolastre.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1281

man sholde loven hys wyf by Discrecioun, paciently and atemprely,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1282

and thanne is she as though it were his suster.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C1.1283

The fifthe fynger of the develes hand is the stynkynge <P_318.C2> dede
of Leccherie.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1284

Certes, the fyve fyngres of Glotonie the feend put in the wombe of a man,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1285

and with his fyve fingres of Lecherie he gripeth hym by the reynes, for
to throwen hym into the fourneys of helle, ther as they shul han the fyr
and the wormes that evere shul lasten, and wepynge and wailynge sharp
hunger and thurst, $and grymnesse of develes, that shullen al totrede
hem without repit and withouten ende.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1286

Of Leccherie, as I seyde, sourden diverse speces, as fornicacioun, that
is bitwixe man and womman that been nat maried, CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1287

and this is deedly synne, and agayns nature.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1288

Al that is enemy and destruccioun to nature is agayns nature.
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1289

Parfay, the resoun of a man telleth eek hym wel that it is deedly synne,
for as muche as God forbad leccherie.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1290

And Seint Paul yeveth hem the regne that nys dewe to no wight but to
hem that doon deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1291

Another synne of leccherie is to bireve a mayden of hir maydenhede,
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1292

for he that so dooth, certes, he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste
degree that is in this present lif CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1293

and bireveth hir thilke percious fruyt that the book clepeth the hundred
fruyt.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1294

I ne kan seye it noon oother-wewyes in englissh, CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1295

but in Latyn it highte Centesimus fructus.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1296

Certes, he that so dooth is cause of manye damages and vileynyes, mo than
any man kan rekene; right as he somtyme is cause of alle damages that
beestes don in the feeld, that breketh the hegge or the closure, thurgh
which he destroyeth that may nat been restoored.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1297

For certes, namoore may maydenhede be restoored than a arm that is smyten
fro the body may retourne agayn to wexe.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1298

She may have mercy, this woot I wel, if she do penitence;
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1299

but nevere shal it be that She nas corrupt.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1300

And al be it so that I have spoken somwhat of avowtrie, it is good to
shewen mo perils that longen to avowtrie, for to eschue that foule synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1301

Avowtrie in latyn is for to seyn, approchynge of oother mannes bed,
thurgh which tho that whilom weren a flessh abowndone hir bodyes to
othere persones.  CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1302

Of this synne, as seith the wise man, folwen manye harmes.
CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1303

First, brekynge of feith, CMCTPARS-M3,318.C2.1304

<P_319.C1>

and certes, in feith is the keye of Cristendom.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1306

And whan that feith is broken and lorn, soothly Cristendom stant veyn
and withouten fruyt.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1307

This synne is eek a thefte, CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1308

for thefte generally is for to reve a wight his thyng agayns his wille.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1309

Certes, this is the fouleste thefte that may be, whan a womman steleth
hir body from hir housbonde And yeveth it to hire holour to defoulen
hire, and steleth hir soule fro Crist and yeveth it to the devel.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1310

This is a fouler thefte than for to breke a chirche and stele the chalice
, CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1311

for thise avowtiers breken the temple of God spiritually,
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1312

and stelen the vessel of grace, that is the body And the soule , for which
Crist shal destroyen hem, as seith Seint Paul.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1313

Soothly, of this thefte douted gretly Joseph, whan that his lordes wyf
preyed hym of vileynye, whan he seyde,"Lo, my lady, how my lord hath
take to me under my warde al that he hath in this world, ne no thyng
of his thynges is out of My power, but oonly ye, that been his wyf.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1314

And how sholde I thanne do this wikkednesse, and synne so horribly agayns
God and agayns my lord?  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1315

God it forbeede! "CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1316

Allas, al to litel is swich trouthe now yfounde.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1317

The thridde harm is the filthe thurgh which they breken the comandement
of God, and defoulen the auctour of matrimoyne, that is Crist.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1318

For certes, in so muche as the sacrement of mariage is so noble
and so digne, so muche is it gretter synne for to breken it,
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1319

for God made mariage in paradys, in the estaat of innocence, to multiplye
mankynde to the service of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1320

And therfore is the brekynge therof the moore grevous; of which brekynge
comen false heires ofte tyme, that wrongfully ocupien folkes heritages.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1321

And therfore wol Crist putte hem out of the regne of hevene, that is
heritage to goode folk.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1322

Of this brekynge comth eek ofte tyme that folk unwar wedden or synnen
with hire owene kynrede, and namely thilke harlotes that haunten bordels
of thise fool wommen, that mowe be likned to a commune gong, where as
men purgen hire ordure.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C1.1323

What seve we eek of putours that lyven by the horrible synne of putrie
, and constreyne wommen to yelden hem a certeyn rente of hire bodily
puterie, ye, <P_319.C2> somtyme of his owene wyf or his child, as Doon
thise bawdes?  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1324

Certes, thise been cursede synnes.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1325

Understoond eek that Avowtrie is set gladly in the ten comandementz
bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre; CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1326

for it is the gretteste thefte that may be, CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1327

for it is thefte of body and of soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1328

And it is lyk to homycide, CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1329

for it kerveth atwo and breketh atwo hem that first were maked o flessh.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1330

And therfore, by the olde lawe of God, they sholde be slayn.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1331

But nathelees, by the lawe of Jhesu Crist, that is lawe of pitee,
whan he seyde to the womman that was founden in avowtrie, and sholde
han been slayn with stones, after the wyl of the jewes, as was hir
lawe, "Go, quod Jhesu Crist,"and have namoore wyl to synne,"or, "wille
namoore to do synne. "Soothly the vengeaunce of Avowtrie is awarded to
the peynes of helle, but if so be that it be destourbed by penitence.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1332

Yet been ther mo speces of this cursed synne; as whan that oon of hem
is religious, or elles bothe; or of folk that been entred into ordre, as
subdekne, or dekne, or preest, or hospitaliers.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1333

And evere the hyer that he is in ordre, the gretter is the synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1334

The thynges that gretly agreggen hire synne is the brekynge of hire avow
of chastitee, whan they receyved the ordre.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1335

And forther over, sooth is that hooly ordre is chief of al the tresorie
of God, and his especial signe and mark of chastitee, to shewe that they
been joyned to chastitee, which that is the moost precious lyf that is.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1336

And thise ordred folk been specially titled to God, and of the special
meignee of God, for which, whan they doon deedly synne, they been the
special traytours of God and of his peple; CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1337

for they lyven of the peple, to preye for the peple,
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1338

and while they been suche traitours, here preyer avayleth nat to the
peple.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1339

Preestes been aungels, as by the dignitee of hir mysterye;
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1340

but for sothe, Seint Paul seith that Sathanas transformeth hym in an
aungel of light.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1341

Soothly, the preest that haunteth deedly synne, he may be likned
to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the aungel of light.
CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1342

He semeth aungel of light, CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1343

but for sothe he is aungel of derknesse.  CMCTPARS-M3,319.C2.1344

Swiche preestes been the sones of Helie, as sheweth <P_320.C1> in the
Book of Kynges, that they weren the sones of Belial - that is, the devel.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1345

Belial is to seyn,"withouten juge. "CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1346

And so faren they; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1347

hem thynketh they been free, and han no juge, namoore than hath
a free bole that taketh which cow that hym liketh in the town.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1348

So faren they by wommen.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1349

For right as a free bole is ynough for al a toun, right so is a wikked
preest corrupcioun ynough for al a parisshe, or for al a contree.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1350

Thise preestes, as seith the book, ne konne nat the mysterie of preesthod
to the peple, CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1351

ne God ne knowe they nat.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1352

They ne helde hem nat apayd, as seith the book, of soden flessh that
was to hem offred, CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1353

but they tooke by force the flessh that is rawe.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1354

Certes, so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayed of roosted flessh
and sode flessh, with which the peple feden hem in greet reverence,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1355

but they wole have raw flessh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1356

And certes, thise wommen that consenten to hire harlotrie doon greet
wrong to Crist, and to hooly chirche, and alle halwes, and to alle soules;
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1357

for they bireven alle thise hym that sholde worshipe Crist and hooly
chirche, and preye for Cristene soules.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1358

And therfore han swiche preestes, and hire lemmanes eek that consenten
to hir leccherie, the malisoun of al the court Cristien, til they come
to amendement.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1359

The thridde spece of avowtrie is somtyme bitwixe a man and his wyf,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1360

and that is whan they take no reward in hire assemblynge but oonly to
hire flesshly delit, as seith Seint jerome, and ne rekken of nothyng
but that they been assembled; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1361

by cause that they been maried, al is good ynough, as thynketh to hem.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1362

But in swich folk hath the devel power, as seyde the aungel Raphael to
thobie, CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1363

for in hire assemblynge they putten Jhesu Crist out of hire herte,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1364

and yeven hemself to alle ordure.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1365

The fourthe spece is the assemblee of hem that been of hire kynrede,
or of hem that been of oon affynytee, or elles with hem with whiche
hir fadres or hir kynrede han deled in the synne of lecherie.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C1.1366

This synne maketh hem lyk to houndes, <P_320.C2> that taken no kep
to kynrede.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1367

And certes, parentele is in two maneres, outher goostly or flesshly;
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1368

goostly, as for to deelen with his god-sibbes.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1369

For right so as he that engendreth a child is his flesshly fader,
right so is his god-fader his fader espiritueel.  for which a womman
may in no lasse synne assemblen with hire godsib than with hire owene
flesshly brother.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1370

The fifthe spece is thilke abhomynable synne, of which that no man
unnethe oghte speke ne write; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1371

nathelees it is openly reherced in holy writ.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1372

This cursednesse doon men and wommen in diverse entente and in diverse
manere; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1373

but though that hooly writ speke of horrible synne, certes hooly writ
may nat been defouled, namoore than the sonne that shyneth on the mixne.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1374

Another synne aperteneth to leccherie, that comth in slepynge,
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1375

and this synne cometh ofte to hem that been maydenes, and eek to hem
that been corrupt; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1376

and this synne men clepen polucioun, that comth in foure maneres.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1377

somtyme of langwissynge of body, for the humours been to ranke and to
habundaunt in the body of man; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1378

somtyme of infermetee, for the fieblesse of the vertu retentif, as {of}
phisik maketh mencion; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1379

somtyme for surfeet of mete and drynke; CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1380

and somtyme of vileyns thoghtes that been enclosed in mannes mynde
whan he gooth to slepe, which may nat been withoute synne; for which
men moste kepen hem wisely, or elles may men synnen ful grevously.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1381

<heading>

Remedium contra peccatum Luxurie.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1383

<$$heading>

Now comth the remedie agayns Leccherie, CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1385

and that is generally chastitee and continence, that restreyneth
alle the desordeynee moevynges that comen of flesshly talentes.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1386

And evere the gretter merite shal He han, that moost restreyneth
the wikkede eschawfynges of the $ardour of this synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1387

And this is in two maneres - that is to seyn, chastitee in mariage,
and chastitee of widwehod.  CMCTPARS-M3,320.C2.1388

Now $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} understonde that matrimoyne is leefful
assemblynge of man and of womman that receyven by vertu of the sacrement
<P_321.C1> the boond thurgh which they may nat be departed in al hir lyf -
that is to seyn, whil that they lyven bothe.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1389

This, as seith the book, is a ful greet sacrement.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1390

God maked it, as I have seyd, in paradys, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1391

and wolde hymself be born in mariage.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1392

And for to halwen mariage he was at a weddynge, where as he turned water
into wyn; which was the firste miracle that he wroghte in erthe biforn
his disciples.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1393

Trewe effect of mariage clenseth fornicacioun CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1394

and replenysseth hooly chirche of good lynage, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1395

for that is the ende of mariage; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1396

and it chaungeth deedly synne into venial synne bitwixe hem that been
ywedded, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1397

and maketh the hertes al oon of hem that been ywedded, as wel as the
bodies.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1398

This is verray mariage, that was establissed by God, er that
synne bigan, whan natureel lawe was in his right poynt in paradys;
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1399

and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have but o womman, and o womman but
o man, As seith Seint Augustyn, by manye resouns.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1400

First, for mariage is figured bitwixe Crist And holy chirche.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1401

And that oother is for a man is heved of a womman; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1402

algate, by ordinaunce it sholde be so.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1403

For if a womman hadde mo men than oon, thanne sholde she have moo hevedes
than oon, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1404

and that were an horrible thyng biforn God; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1405

and eek a womman ne myghte nat plese to many folk at oones.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1406

And also ther ne sholde nevere be pees ne reste amonges hem,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1407

for everich wolde axen his owene thyng.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1408

And forther over, no man ne sholde knowe his owene engendrure, ne who
sholde have his heritage; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1409

and the womman sholde been the lasse biloved fro the tyme that she were
conjoynt to many men.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1410

Now comth how that a man sholde bere hym with his wif, and namely in two
thynges; that is to seyn, in suffraunce and reverence, as shewed Crist
whan he made first womman.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1411

For he ne made hire nat of the heved of adam, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1412

for she sholde nat clayme to greet lordshipe.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1413

For ther as the womman hath the maistrie, she maketh to muche desray.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1414

Ther neden none ensamples of this; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1415

the experience of day by day oghte suffise.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1416

Also, certes, God ne made nat womman of the foot of adam,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C1.1417

for she ne sholde nat <P_321.C2> been holden to lowe;
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1418

for she kan nat paciently suffre.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1419

But God made womman of the ryb of Adam, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1420

for womman sholde be felawe unto man.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1421

man sholde bere hym to his wyf in feith, in trouthe, and in love,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1422

as seith Seint Paul, that a man sholde loven his wyf as Crist
loved hooly chirche, that loved it so wel that he deyde for it.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1423

So sholde a man for his wyf, if it were nede.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1424

Now how that a womman sholde be subget to hire housbonde, that telleth
Seint Peter.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1425

First, in obedience.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1426

And eek as seith the decree, a womman that is wyf, as longe as she is
a wyf, she hath noon auctoritee to swere ne to bere witnesse withoute
leve of hir housbonde, that is hire Lord; CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1427

algate, he sholde be so by resoun.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1428

She sholde eek serven hym in alle honestee, and been attempree of
hire array.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1429

I woot wel that they sholde setten hire entente to plesen hir housbondes,
but nat By hire queyntise of array.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1430

Seint dJjerome seith that"wyves that been apparailled in silk
And in precious purpre ne mowe nat clothen Hem in Jhesu Crist.
"CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1431

Loke what seith Seint John eek in thys matere?  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1432

Seint Gregorie eek seith that"No wight seketh precious array but
oonly for veyne glorie, to been honoured the moore biforn the peple.
"CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1433

It is a greet folye, a womman to have a fair array outward and in hirself
be foul inward.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1434

A wyf sholde eek be mesurable in lookynge and in berynge and in lawghynge,
and discreet in alle hire wordes and hire dedes.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1435

And aboven alle worldy thyng she sholde loven hire houbonde with al hire
herte, and to hym be trewe of hir body.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1436

So sholde an housbonde eek be to his wyf.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1437

For sith that al the body is the housbondes, so sholde hire herte been ,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1438

or elles ther is bitwixe hem two, as in that, no parfit mariage.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1439

Thanne shal men understonde that for thre thynges a man and his wyf
flesshly mowen assemble.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1440

The firste is in entente of engendrure of children to the service of God,
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1441

for certes that is the cause final of matrimoyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1442

Another cause is to yelden everich of hem to oother the dette of hire
bodies, CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1443

for neither of hem hath power of his owene body.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1444

The thridde is for to eschewe leccherye and vileynye.
CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1445

The ferthe is for sothe deedly synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,321.C2.1446

As to the firste, it is <P_322.C1> mertorie; the seconde also,
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1447

for, as seith the decree, that she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth
to hire housbonde the dette of hir body, ye, though it be agayn hir
likynge and the lust of hire herte.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1448

The thridde manere is venyal synne; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1449

and, trewely, scarsly may ther any of thise be withoute venial synne,
for the corrupcion and for the delit.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1450

The fourthe manere is for to understonde, as if they assemble oonly
for amorous love and for noon of the foreseyde causes, but for
to accomplice thilke brennynge delit, they rekke nevere how ofte.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1451

Soothly it is deedly synne; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1452

and yet, with sorwe, somme folk wol peynen hem moore to doon than to
hire appetit suffiseth.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1453

The seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene wydewe, and
eschue the embracynges of man, and desiren the embracynge of Jhesu Crist.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1454

Thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hire housbondes,
and eek wommen that han doon leccherie and been releeved by penitence.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1455

And certes, if that a wyf koude kepen hire al chaast by licence of
hir housbonde, so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he agilte,
it were to hire a greet merite.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1456

Thise manere wommen that observen chastitee moste be clene in herte as wel
as in body and in thought, and mesurable in clothynge and in contenaunce,
And been abstinent in etynge and drynkynge, in spekynge, and in dede.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1457

They been the vessel or the boyste of the blissed magdelene, that
fulfilleth hooly chirche of good odour.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1458

The thridde manere of chastitee is virginitee, CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1459

and it bihoveth that she be hooly in herte and clene of body.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1460

Thanne is she spouse to Jhesu Crist, CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1461

And she is the lyf of angeles.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1462

She is the preisynge of this world, CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1463

and she is as thise martirs in egalitee; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1464

she hath in hire that tonge may nat telle ne herte thynke.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1465

Virginitee baar oure Lord Jhesu Crist, CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1466

and virgine was hymselve.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1467

Another remedie agayns Leccherie is specially to withdrawen swiche thynges
as yeve occasion to thilke vileynye, as ese, etynge, and drynkynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1468

For certes, whan the pot boyleth strongly, the beste remedie is to
withdrawe the fyr.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1469

Slepynge longe in greet quiete is eek a greet norice to Leccherie.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C1.1470

<P_322.C2>

Another remedie agayns Leccherie is that a man or a womman
eschue the compaignye of hem by whiche he douteth to be tempted,
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1472

for al be it so that the dede be withstonden, yet is ther greet
temptacioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1473

Soothly, a whit wal, although it ne brenne noght fully by stikynge of
a candele, yet is the wal blak of the leyt.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1474

Ful ofte tyme I rede that no man truste in his owene perfeccioun, but he
be stronger than Sampson, and hoolier than David, and wiser than Salomon.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1475

Now after that I have declared yow, as I kan, the sevene deedly synnes
, and somme of hire braunches and hire remedies, soothly, if I koude,
I wolde telle yow the ten comandementz.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1476

but so heigh a doctrine I lete to divines.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1477

Nathelees, I hope to God, they been touched in this tretice, everich of
hem alle.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1478

<heading>

Sequitur secunda pars Penitencie.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1480

<$$heading>

Now for as muche as the seconde partie of Penitence stant in confessioun
of mouth, as I bigan in the firste chapitre, I seye, Seint Augustyn
seith,"Synne is every word and every dede, and al that men coveiten,
agayn the lawe of Jhesu Crist; CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1482

and this is for to synne in herte, in mouth, and in dede, by thy fyve
wittes, that been sighte, herynge, smellynge, tastynge or savourynge,
and feelynge. "CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1483

Now is it good to understonde the circumstances that agreggen muchel
every synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1484

Thou shalt considere what thow art that doost the synne, wheither thou
be male or femele, Yong or oold, gentil or thral, free or servant,
hool or syk, wedded or sengle, ordred or unordred, wys or fool, clerk
or seculeer; if she be of thy kynrded, bodily or goostly, or noon; if
any of thy kynrede have synned with hire, or noon; and manye mo thinges.
CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1485

Another circumstaunce is this: wheither it be doon in fornicacioun
or in avowtrie or noon; incest or noon; mayden or noon; in manere of
homicide or noon; horrible grete synnes or smale; and how longe thou
hast continued in synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,322.C2.1486

The thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast do synne;
wheither in oother mennes hous or in thyn owene; in feeld Or in
chirche or in chirchehawe; in chirche <P_323.C1> dedicaat or noon.
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1487

For if the chirche be halwed, and man or womman spille his kynde inwith
that place, by wey or synne or by wikked temptacioun, the chirche is
entredited til it be reconsiled by the bysshop.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1488

And The preest sholde be enterdited that dide swich a vileynye;
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1489

to terme of al his lif he sholde namoore synge masse,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1490

and if he dide, he sholde doon deedly synne at every time that he so
songe masse.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1491

The fourthe circumstaunce is by whiche mediatours, or by whiche
messagers, as for enticement, or for consentement to bere compaignye
with felaweshipe; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1492

for many a wrecche, for to bere compaignye, wol go to the devel of helle.
Wherfore they that eggen or consenten to the synne been parteners of
the synne, and of the dampnacioun of the synnere.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1493

The fifthe circumstaunce is how manye tymes that he hath synned, if it
be in his mynde, and how ofte that he hath falle.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1494

For he that ofte falleth in synne, he despiseth the mercy of God,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1495

and encreesseth hys synne, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1496

and is unkynde to Crist; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1497

and he wexeth the moore fieble to withstonde synne,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1498

and synneth the moore lightly, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1499

and the latter ariseth, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1500

and is the moore eschew for to shryven hym, and namely, to hym that is
his confessour.  For which that folk, whan they falle agayn in hir olde
folies, outher they forleten hir olde confessours al outrely, or eles
they departen hir shrift in diverse places; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1501

but soothly, swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of God of his
synnes.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1502

The sixte sircumstaunce is why that a man synneth, as by which
temptacioun; and if hymself procure thilke temptacioun, or by the
excitynge of oother folk; or if he synne with a womman by force, or by
hire owene assent; of if the womman, maugree hir hed, hath been afforced,
or noon.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1503

This shal she telle: for coveitise, or for poverte, and if it was hire
procurynge, or noon; and swich manere harneys.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1504

The seventhe circumstaunce is in what manere he hath doon his
synne, or how that she hath suffred that folk han doon to hire.
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C1.1505

And the same shal the man telle pleynly with alle circumstaunces; and
<P_323.C2> wheither he hath synned with comune bordel wommen, or noon,
or doon his synne in hooly tymes, or noon, in fastyng tymes, or noon,
or biforn his shrifte, or after his latter shrifte, and hath peraventure
broken therfore his penance enjoyned, by whos help and whos conseil;
by sorcerie or craft; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1506

al moste be toold.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1507

Alle thise thynges, after that they been grete or smale, engreggen the
conscience of man.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1508

And eek the preest, that is thy juge, may the bettre been avysed of his
juggement in yevynge of thy penaunce, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1509

and that is after thy contricioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1510

For understond wel that after tyme that a man hath defouled his baptesme
by synne, if he wole come to salvacioun, ther is noon other wey but
by penitence and shrifte and satisfaccioun; and namely by the two,
if ther be a confessour to which he may shriven hym, and the thridde,
if he have lyf to parfournen it.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1511

Thanne shal man looke and considere that if he wole maken a trewe
and a profitable confessioun, ther moste be foure condiciouns.
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1512

First, it moot been in sorweful bitternesse of herte, as seyde the kyng
Ezechias to God, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1513

"I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lif in bitternesse of myn herte.
"CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1514

This condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve signes.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1515

The firste is that confessioun moste be shamefast, nat for to coyere
ne hyden his synne, for he hath agilt his God and defouled his soule.
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1516

And herof seith Seint Augustyn,"The herte tavailleth for shame of his
synne"; CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1517

and for he hath greet shamefastnesse, he is digne to have greet mercy
of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1518

Swich was the confessioun of the publican that wolde nat heven up his
eyen to hevene, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1519

for he hadde offended God of hevene; for which shamefastnesse he hadde
anon the mercy of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1520

And therof seith Seint Augustyn that swich shamefast folk been next
foryevenesse and remissioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1521

Another signe is humylitee in confessioun, of which seith Seint Peter,
"Humbleth yow under the myght of God. "CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1522

The hond of God is myghty in confessioun, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1523

for therby God foryeveth thee thy synnes, CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1524

for he allone hath the power.  CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1525

And this humylitee shal been in herte, and in signe outward,
CMCTPARS-M3,323.C2.1526

for right as he hath humylitee to God in his herte, right so sholde
he <P_324.C1> humble his body outward to the preest, that sit in
goddes place.  For which in no manere, sith that Crist is sovereyn,
and the preest meene and mediatour bitwixe Crist and the synnere, and
the synnere is the laste by wey of resoun, thanne sholde nat the synnere
sitte as heighe as his confessour, but knele biforn hym or at his feet,
but if maladie destourbe it.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1527

For he shal nat taken kep who sit there, but in whos place that he
sitteth.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1528

a man that hath trespased to a lord, and comth for to axe mercy and
maken his accord, and set him doun anon by the Lord, men wolde holden
hym outrageous, and nat worthy so soone for to have remissioun ne mercy.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1529

The thridde signe is how that thy shrift sholde Be ful of teeris, if
man may, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1530

and if man may nat wepe with his bodily eyen, lat hym wepe in herte.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1531

Swich was the confession of Seint Peter, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1532

for after that he hadde forsake Jhesu Crist, he wente out
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1533

and weep ful bitterly.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1534

The fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat for shame to shewen his
confessioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1535

Swich was the confessioun of the Magdalene, that ne spared, for no shame
of hem that weren $at $te {TEXT:atte} feeste, for to go to oure Lord
Jhesu Crist and biknowe to hym hire synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1536

The fifthe signe is that a man or a womman be obeisant to receyven the
penaunce that hym is enjoyned for his synnes, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1537

for certes, Jhesu Crist, for the giltes of o man, was obedient to
the deeth.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1538

The seconde condicion of verray confession is that it be hastily doon.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1539

For certes, if a man hadde a deedly wounde, evere the lenger that he
taried to warisshe hymself, the moore wolde it corrupte and haste hym
to his deeth, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1540

and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to heele.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1541

And right so fareth synne that longe tyme is in a man unshewed.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1542

Certes, a man Oghte hastily shewen his synnes for manye causes; as for
drede of deeth, that cometh ofte sodeynly, and no certeyn what tyme it
shal be, ne in what place; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1543

and eek the drecchynge of o synne draweth in another;
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1544

and eek the lenger that he tarieth, the ferther he is fro Crist.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1545

And if he abide to his laste day, scarsly may he shryven hym or remembre
hym of his synnes or repenten hym, for the grevous maladie of his deeth.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C1.1546

And for as muche as he <P_324.C2> ne hath nat in his lyf herkned Jhesu
Crist whanne he hath spoken, he shal crie to Jhesu Crist at his laste
day, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1547

and scarsly wol he herkne hym.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1548

And understond that this condicioun moste han foure thunges.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1549

Thi shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1550

for wikked haste dooth no profit; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1551

and that a man konne shryve hym of his synnes, be it of pride, or of
envye, and so forth with the speces and circumstances; and that he have
comprehended in hys mynde the nombre and the greetnesse of his synnes, and
how longe that he hath leyn in synne; and eek that he be contrit of his
synnes, and in stidefast purpos, by the grace of God, nevere eft to falle
in synne; and eek that he drede and countrewaite hymself, that he fle
the occasiouns of synne to whiche he is enclyned.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1552

Also thou shalt shryve thee of alle thy synnes to o man, and nat a parcel
to o man and a parcel to another; that is to understonde, in entente to
departe thy confessioun, as for shame of drede, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1553

for it nys but stranglynge of thy soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1554

For certes Jhesu Crist is entierly al good; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1555

in hym nys noon imperfeccioun, CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1556

and therfore Outher he foryeveth al parfitly or never a deel.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1557

I seye nat that if thow be assigned to the penitauncer for certein synne
, that thow art bounde to shewen hym al the remenaunt of thy synnes,
of whiche thow hast be shryven of thy curaat, but if it like to thee of
thyn humylitee; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1558

this is no departynge of shrifte.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1559

Ne I seye nat, ther as I speke of divisioun of confessioun, that if thou
have licence for to shryve thee to a discreet and an honest preest ,
where thee liketh, and by licence of thy curaat, that thow ne mayst wel
shryve thee to him of al alle thy synnes.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1560

But lat no blotte be bihynde; CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1561

lat no synne been untoold, as fer as thow hast remembraunce.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1562

And whan thou shalt be shryven to thy curaat, telle hym eek
alle the synnes that thow hast doon syn thou were last yshryven;
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1563

this is no wikked entente of divisioun of shrifte.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1564

Also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns.
CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1565

First, that thow shryve thee by thy free wil, noght constreyned , ne for
shame of folk, ne for maladie, ne swich thynges.  CMCTPARS-M3,324.C2.1566

For <P_325.C1a> it is resoun that he that trespaseth by his free wyl,
that by his free wyl he confesse his trespas, and that noon oother man
telle his synne but he hymself; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1567

ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his synne, ne wratthe hym agayn the preest
for his amonestynge to lete synne.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1568

The seconde condicioun is that thy shrift be laweful, That is to seyn
, that thow that shryvest thee, and eek the preest that hereth thy
confessioun, been verraily in the feith of hooly chirche; and that a
man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of Jhesu Crist, as Caym or Judas.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1569

And eek a man moot accusen hymself of his owene trespas, and nat another
; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1570

but he shal blame and wyten hymself and his owene malice of his synne,
and noon oother.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1571

But nathelees, if that another man be occasioun or enticere of his synne ,
or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh which his synne is agregged,
or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven hym but he telle the persone
with which he hath synned, thanne may he telle it, so that his entente
ne be nat to bakbite the persone, but oonly to declaren his confessioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1572

Thou ne shalt nat eek make no lesynges in Thy confessioun, for humylitee
, peraventure, to seyn that thou hast doon synnes of whiche thow were
nevere gilty.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1a.1573

For Seint Augustyn seith,"If thou, by cause of thyn hymylitee, makest
lesynges on thyself, though thow ne <P_325.C2a> were nat in synne
biforn, yet $art $tow {TEXT:artow} thanne in synne thurgh thy lesynges.
"CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1574

Thou most eek shewe thy synne by thyn owene propre mouth, but thow be
woxe dowmb, and nat by no lettre; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1575

for thow that hast doon the synne, thou shalt have the shame therfore.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1576

Thow shalt nat eek peynte thy confessioun by faire subtile wordes,
to covere the moore thy synne; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1577

for thanne $bigilest $tow {TEXT:bigilestow} thyself, and nat the preest.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1578

Thow most tellen it platly, be it nevere so foul ne so horrible.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1579

Thow shalt eek shryve thee to a preest that is discreet to conseille
thee; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1580

and eek thou shalt nat shryve thee for veyne glorie, ne for ypocrisye,
ne for no cause but oonly for the doute of Jhesu Crist and the heele of
thy soule.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1581

Thow shalt nat eek renne to the preest sodeynly to tellen hym lightly
thy synne, as whoso telleth a jape or a tale, but avysely and with
greet devocioun.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1582

And generally, shryve thee ofte.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1583

If thou ofte falle, ofte thou arise by confessioun.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1584

And though thou shryve thee ofter than ones of synne of which thou hast
be shryven, it is the moore merite.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1585

And, as seith Seint Augustyn, thow shalt have the moore lightly relessyng
and grace of God, bothe of synne and of peyne.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1586

And certes, oones a yeere $at $te {TEXT:atte} leeste wey it is laweful
for to been housled, CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1587

for certes, oones a yeere alle thynges renovellen.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1588

Now have I toold yow of verray Confessioun, that is the seconde partie
of Penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1589

<heading>

Explicit secunda pars Penitencie, et sequitur tercia pars eiusdem.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2a.1591

<$$heading>

<P_325.C1b>

The thridde partie of Penitence is Satisfaccioun, CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1594

and that stant moost generally in almesse and in bodily peyne.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1595

Now been ther thre manere of almesse: contricion of herte, where a man
offreth hymself to God; CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1596

another is to han pitee of defaute of his neighebores;
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1597

and the thridde is in yevynge of good conseil and comfort, goostly and
bodily, where men han nede, and namely in sustenaunce of mannes foode.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1598

And tak kep that a man hath nede of thise thinges generally:
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1599

he hath nede of foode, CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1600

he hath nede of clothyng and herberwe, CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1601

he hath nede of charitable conseil and visitynge in prisone and in
maladie, and sepulture of his dede body.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C1b.1602

<P_325.C2b>

And if thow mayst nat visite the nedeful with thy persone, visite hym
by thy message and by thy yiftes.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1604

Thise been general almesses or werkes of charitee of hem
that han temporeel richesses or discrecioun in conseilynge.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1605

Of thise werkes $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} heren at the day of doom.
CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1606

Thise almesses $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} doon of thyne owene propre
thynges, and hastily and prively, if thow mayst.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1607

But nathelees, if thow mayst nat doon it prively, thow shalt nat forbere
to doon almesse though men seen it, so that it be nat doon for thank of
the world, but Oonly for thank of Jhesu Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,325.C2b.1608

For, as witnesseth Seint Mathew, capitulo quinto, <P_326.C1>"A citee
may nat been hyd that is set on a dmMontayne, CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1609

ne men lighte nat a lanterne CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1610

and put it under a busshel, CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1611

but men sette it on a candle-stikke to yeve light to the men in the hous.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1612

Right so shal youre light lighten bifore men, that they may seen
youre goode werkes, And glorifie youre fader that is in hevene.
"CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1613

Now as to speken of bodily peyne, it stant in preyeres, in wakynges,
in fastynges, in vertuouse techynges of orisouns.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1614

And ye shul understonde that orisouns or preyeres is for to seyn a
pitous wyl of herte, that redresseth it in God and expresseth it by
word outward, to remoeven harmes and to han thynges espiritueel and
durable , and somtyme temporele thynges; of whiche orisouns, certes, in
the orison of the Pater noster hath Jhesu Crist enclosed moost thynges.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1615

Certes, it is privyleged of thre thynges in his dignytee, for which it
is moore digne than any oother preyere; for that Jhesu Crist hymself
maked it; CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1616

and it is short, for it sholde be koud the moore lightly, and for to
withholden it the moore esily in herte, and helpen hymself the ofter with
the orisoun, and for a man sholde be the lasse wery to seyen it , and for
a man may nat excusen hym to lerne it, it is so short and so esy; and for
it comprehendeth in it self alle goode preyeres.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1617

The exposicioun of this hooly preyere, that is so excellent and digne,
I bitake to thise maistres of theologie, save thus muchel wol I seyn;
that whan thow prayest that God sholde for yeve thee thy giltes as thou
foryevest hem that agilten to thee, be ful wel war that thow ne be nat
out of charitee.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1618

This hooly orison amenuseth eek venyal synne, CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1619

and therfore it aperteneth specially to penitence.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1620

This preyere moste be trewely seyd, and in verray feith,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1621

and that men preye to God ordinatly and discreetly and devoutly;
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1622

and alwey a man shal putten his wyl to be subget to the wille of God.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1623

This orisoun moste eek Been seyd with greet humblesse and ful
pure; honestly, and nat to the anoyaunce of any man or womman.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1624

It moste eek been continued with the werkes of charitee.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1625

It avayleth eek agayn the vices of the soule, CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1626

for, as seith Seint Jerome,"By fastynge been saved the vices of the
flessh, and by preyere the vices of the soule. " CMCTPARS-M3,326.C1.1627

<P_326.C2>

After this, thou shalt understonde that bodily peyne stant in wakynge,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1629

for Jhesu Crist seith,"Waketh and preyeth, that ye ne entre in wikked
temptacioun. "CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1630

Ye shul understanden also that fastynge stant in thre thynges:
in forberynge of bodily mete and drynke, and in forberynge of
worldly jolitee, and in forberynge of deedly synne; this is to
seyn, that a man shal kepen hym fro deedly synne with al his might.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1631

And thou shalt understanden eek that God ordeyned fastynge,
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1632

and to fastynge appertenen foure thinges: largenesse to povre folk;
gladnesse of herte espiritueel, nat to been angry ne anoyed, ne grucche
for he fasteth; and also resonable houre for to ete; ete by mesure;
that is for to seyn, a man shal nat ete in untyme, ne sitte the lenger
at his table to ete for he fasteth.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1633

Thanne $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} understonde that bodily peyne stant in
disciplyne or techynge, by word, or by writynge, or in ensample ; also in
werynge of heyres, or of stamyn, or of haubergeons on hire naked flessh,
for Cristes sake, and swiche manere penances.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1634

But war thee wel that swiche manere penaunces on thy flessh ne make nat
thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of thyself; CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1635

for bettre is to caste awey Thyn heytre, than for to caste awey the
swetenesse of Jhesu Crist.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1636

And therfore seith Seint Paul,"Clothe yow, as they that been chosen of
God, in herte of misericorde, debonairetee, suffraunce, and swich manere
of clothynge,"of whiche Jhesu Crist is moore apayed than of heyres,
or haubergeouns, or hauberkes.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1637

Thanne is discipline eek in knokkynge of thy brest, in scourgynge with
yerdes, in knelynges, in tribulaciouns, in suffrynge paciently wronges
that been doon to thee, and eek in pacient suffraunce of maladies, or
lesynge of worldly catel, or of wyf, or of child, or othere freendes.
CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1638

Thanne $shalt $tow {TEXT:shaltow} understonde whiche thynges destourben
penaunce; CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1639

and this is in foure maneres, that is, drede, shame, hope, and wanhope,
that is, desperacion.  CMCTPARS-M3,326.C2.1640

And for to speke first of drede; for which he weneth that he may suffre
no penaunce; ther-agayns is remedie for to thynke that bodily penaunce
is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of helle, <P_327.C1>
that is so crueel and so long that it lasteth withouten ende.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1641

Now again the shame that a man hath to shryven hym, and namely thise
ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede
to shryven hem; agayns that shame sholde a man thynke that, by wey of
resoun, that he that hath nat been shamed To doon foule thinges, certes
hym oghte nat been ashamed to do faire thynges, CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1642

and that is confessiouns.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1643

A man sholde eek thynke that God seeth and woot alle his thoghtes and
alle his werkes, CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1644

to hym may no thyng been hyd ne covered.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1645

men sholden eek remembren hem of the shame that is to come at the day
of doom to hem that been nat penitent and shryven in this present lyf.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1646

For alle the creatures in hevene, in erthe, and in helle shullen seen
apertly al that they hyden in this world.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1647

Now for to speken of the hope of hem that been necligent and slowe to
shryven hem, that stant in two maneres.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1648

That Oon is that he hopeth for to lyve longe And for to purchacen muche
richesse for his delit, CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1649

and thanne he wol shryven hym; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1650

and as he seith, hym semeth thanne tymely ynough to come to shrifte.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1651

Another is of surquidrie that he hath in Cristes mercy.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1652

Agayns the firste vice, he shal thynke that oure life is in no sikernesse
, and eek that alle the richesses in this world ben in aventure, and
passen as a shadwe on the wal; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1653

and, as seith Seint Gregorie, that it aperteneth to the grete righwisnesse
of God that nevere shal the peyne stynte of hem that nevere wolde
withdrawen hem fro synne, hir thankes, but ay continue in synne ;
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1654

for thilke perpetueel wil to do synne shul they han perpetueel peyne.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1655

Wanhope is in two maneres: CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1656

the firste wanhope is in the mercy of Crist; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C1.1657

that oother is that they thynken that they ne myghte <P_327.C2> that
longe persevere in goodnesse.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1658

The firste wanhope comth of that he demeth that he hath synned so greetly
and so ofte, and so longe leyn in synne, that he shal nat be saved.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1659

Certes, agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he thynke that the passion
of Jhesu Crist is moore strong for to bynde than synne is strong for
to bynde.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1660

Agayns the seconde wanhope he shal thynke that as ofte as he falleth he
may arise agayn by penitence.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1661

And though he never so longe have leyn in synne, the mercy of Crist is
alwey redy to receiven hym to mercy.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1662

Agayns the wanhope that he demeth that he sholde nat longe persevere in
goodnesse, he shal thynke that the feblesse of the devel may nothyng doon,
but if men wol suffren hym; CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1663

and eek he shal han strengthe of the help of God, and of al hooly chirche,
and of the proteccioun of aungels, if hym list.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1664

Thanne shal men understonde what is the fruyt of penaunce;
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1665

and, after the word of Jhesu Crist, it is the endelees blisse of hevene,
ther joye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne grevaunce; ther alle harmes
been passed of this present lyf; ther as is the sikernesse fro the peyne
of helle; ther as is the blisful compaignye that rejoysen hem everemo,
everich of Otheres joye; ther as the body of man, that whilom was foul
and derk, is moore cleer than the sonne; ther as the body, that whilom
was syk, freele, and fieble, and mortal, is inmortal, And so strong and
so hool that ther may no thyng apeyren it; ther as ne is neither hunger,
thurst, ne coold, but every soule replenyssed with the sighte of the
parfit knowynge of God.  CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1666

This blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espiritueel, and the
glorie by lowenesse, the plentee of joye by hunger and thurst, and the
reste by travaille, and the lyf by deeth and mortificacion of synne.
CMCTPARS-M3,327.C2.1667
